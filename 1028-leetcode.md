> **LeetCode 1028 – Hard**  
> **Keywords:** *Binary Tree, Preorder Traversal, Depth Encoding, Stack, Recursion, LeetCode 1028, Interview Prep, Algorithm Design*

---

## Problem Recap

You are given a string that represents a **preorder** traversal of a binary tree.  
Each node is printed as:

```
D dashes + value
```

* `D` – depth of the node (root depth = 0).  
* `-` – dash character.  
* `value` – positive integer (1 ≤ value ≤ 10⁹).

If a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be the **left** child.  
Reconstruct the original tree and return its root.

> Example  
> Input: `"1-2--3--4-5--6--7"`  
> Output: `[1,2,5,3,4,6,7]` (level‑order representation)

## 2.  Choosing the Right Approach

| Approach | Time | Space | Complexity |
|----------|------|-------|------------|
| **Recursive descent** (DFS) | **O(n)** – one pass over the string | **O(h)** – recursion stack, `h` = height | **O(n)** overall |
| **Stack** | **O(n)** | **O(h)** | **O(n)** |

Both methods are O(n) and fit the constraints (n ≤ 1000).  
The *stack* method is often preferred for interviewers because it avoids recursion depth issues and is very intuitive.

Below we present the **stack implementation** in three languages (Java, Python, C++).  
The code is ready‑to‑copy and includes the `TreeNode` definitions required by LeetCode.

## 3.  Reference Implementation – Stack Method  

### 3.1 Java

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode recoverTree(String S) {
        if (S == null || S.isEmpty()) return null;

        // Each element in the stack corresponds to a node at its depth.
        // stack.peek() is the parent of the next node to be created.
        Deque<NodeWithDepth> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();

        int i = 0;                       // current index in the string
        while (i < S.length()) {
            // 1️⃣  count dashes → depth of the upcoming node
            int depth = 0;
            while (i < S.length() && S.charAt(i) == '-') {
                depth++;
                i++;
            }

            // 2️⃣  read the integer value
            int val = 0;
            while (i < S.length() && Character.isDigit(S.charAt(i))) {
                val = val * 10 + (S.charAt(i) - '0');
                i++;
            }

            TreeNode node = new TreeNode(val);

            // 3️⃣  shrink the stack until it contains only ancestors of the current node
            while (stack.size() > depth) {
                stack.pop();
            }

            // 4️⃣  attach the new node to its parent
            if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                TreeNode parent = stack.peek();
                if (parent.left == null) parent.left = node;
                else parent.right = node;
            }

            // 5️⃣  push the new node – it becomes the current depth’s node
            stack.push(node);
        }

        // The first element pushed is the root
        return stack.isEmpty() ? null : stack.peekLast();
    }

    /** Helper class to keep depth with node */
    private static class NodeWithDepth {
        TreeNode node;
        int depth;
        NodeWithDepth(TreeNode node, int depth) {
            this.node = node;
            this.depth = depth;
        }
    }
}
```

> **Why `stack.peekLast()`?**  
> After the loop, the stack contains the entire path from root to the deepest node.  
> The root is the *bottom* element – `peekLast()` gives it in O(1).

### 3.2 Python

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def recoverTree(self, S: str) -> 'Optional[TreeNode]':
        if not S:
            return None

        stack = []           # stack of (depth, TreeNode)
        i = 0

        while i < len(S):
            # 1️⃣  depth
            depth = 0
            while i < len(S) and S[i] == '-':
                depth += 1
                i += 1

            # 2️⃣  value
            val = 0
            while i < len(S) and S[i].isdigit():
                val = val * 10 + int(S[i])
                i += 1

            node = TreeNode(val)

            # 3️⃣  prune stack to current depth
            while len(stack) > depth:
                stack.pop()

            # 4️⃣  attach node
            if stack:
                parent = stack[-1]
                if parent.left is None:
                    parent.left = node
                else:
                    parent.right = node

            # 5️⃣  push current node
            stack.append(node)

        # 6️⃣  root is the bottom of the stack
        return stack[0] if stack else None
```

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* recoverTree(string S) {
        if (S.empty()) return nullptr;

        struct NodeDepth {
            TreeNode* node;
            int depth;
            NodeDepth(TreeNode* n, int d) : node(n), depth(d) {}
        };

        vector<NodeDepth> stack;   // vector used as a stack
        int i = 0;                // current index in S

        while (i < S.size()) {
            // 1️⃣ depth
            int depth = 0;
            while (i < S.size() && S[i] == '-') {
                depth++;
                i++;
            }

            // 2️⃣ value
            int val = 0;
            while (i < S.size() && isdigit(S[i])) {
                val = val * 10 + (S[i] - '0');
                i++;
            }

            TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(val);

            // 3️⃣ pop to correct depth
            while (!stack.empty() && stack.back().depth >= depth)
                stack.pop_back();

            // 4️⃣ attach to parent
            if (!stack.empty()) {
                TreeNode* parent = stack.back().node;
                if (parent->left == nullptr)
                    parent->left = node;
                else
                    parent->right = node;
            }

            // 5️⃣ push the new node
            stack.emplace_back(node, depth);
        }

        // 6️⃣ root is the first element pushed
        return stack.empty() ? nullptr : stack.front().node;
    }
};
```

> All three snippets parse the string **once**, maintain a stack of ancestors, and correctly attach left/right children based on availability.

### 4.3 Problem Statement

LeetCode 1028 asks you to rebuild a binary tree given its **preorder** traversal with depth encoded as hyphens. The input string length never exceeds 1 000, and node values are in the range 1…10⁹.  

**Goal:** Return the root of the rebuilt tree.

---

### 4.4 Why Binary‑Tree Reconstruction Matters

- **Real‑world data**: Many systems serialize trees (e.g., file system trees, UI component hierarchies) using depth markers.  
- **Interview classic**: This problem tests string parsing, recursion/stack skills, and a firm grasp of tree traversal order.  
- **Algorithmic foundation**: Solving it demonstrates mastery over DFS, stack manipulation, and back‑tracking—concepts that surface in many senior‑level roles.

---

### 4.5 Constraints & Edge Cases

| Constraint | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| `n ≤ 1000` | One‑pass solutions are fine; recursion depth ≤ 1000 (safe in Java/Python) |
| Node has at most one child → left child | No ambiguity when attaching nodes; left‑first rule holds |
| Hyphen count equals depth | Allows us to validate the structure on the fly |

*Edge Cases to test:*
- Skewed tree (`"1-2-3-4-5"`) → all nodes are left children.  
- Single node (`"42"`) → depth 0, no dashes.  
- Large numbers (`"1000000000-2"`) → ensure 64‑bit integer handling.

---

### 4.6 Approaches – Stack vs Recursion

| Feature | Stack | Recursion |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Readability** | High (parent list = depth) | Medium‑High |
| **Stack depth safety** | ✔ (iterative) | ✖ (may overflow on deep skewed trees) |
| **Memory overhead** | `O(h)` nodes in stack | `O(h)` recursion calls |
| **Complexity** | `O(n)` time, `O(h)` space | `O(n)` time, `O(h)` space |

The *stack* method is interview‑friendly: it gives you a clear visual of the ancestor chain.  
The *recursive* method is more concise in code but risks a stack overflow if the tree depth approaches the string length.

---

### 4.7 Reference Implementations

Below is the **iterative stack** solution (Java, Python, C++), followed by a short recap of the *recursive* variant for completeness.

- **Java** – uses `ArrayDeque` and a custom `NodeWithDepth`.  
- **Python** – leverages a list as a stack, `isdigit()` for parsing.  
- **C++** – vector acting as a stack; struct for depth.  

(Refer to Section 4.2 for full code.)

---

### 4.8 Time & Space Analysis

Let `h` be the maximum depth of the tree (`≤ n`).

|  | **Time** | **Space** |
|---|----------|-----------|
| Stack | `O(n)` – each char visited once | `O(h)` – number of nodes in the stack |
| Recursion | `O(n)` – same as stack | `O(h)` – call stack, same as stack |

Both achieve linear time. The space usage is bounded by the tree’s depth; in worst case `h = n`.

---

### 4.9 Pros & Cons of the Stack Method

**Pros**

- **Deterministic** – parent is always on top of stack.  
- **No need for back‑tracking** – we prune the stack once the depth matches.  
- **Memory locality** – stack elements live in contiguous memory.

**Cons**

- Requires an auxiliary data structure (stack) that may feel “heavy” if you’re used to pure recursion.  
- Slightly more boilerplate to handle pruning and attaching.  

Overall, the stack approach wins on *interview ergonomics*.

---

### 4.10 Common Interview Pitfalls

1. **Assuming the string is whitespace‑delimited** → forget to handle hyphen counting.  
2. **Attaching children in wrong order** → must check if left is free before assigning right.  
3. **Index overflow** → reading digits must stop at non‑digit or string end.  
4. **Using the wrong stack method** → e.g., popping too aggressively (depth > `stack.size()`) leads to `NullPointerException`/segfault.  
5. **Ignoring the left‑child rule** → can’t deduce whether a node is left or right child without the rule.

---

### 4.11 How to Use This Knowledge in a Technical Interview

1. **Explain the problem clearly**: Mention preorder, hyphen depth, and left‑first rule.  
2. **Discuss potential solutions**: Show awareness of iterative vs recursive, trade‑offs.  
3. **Choose stack for clarity**: “I’ll use a stack to maintain ancestors because it gives a natural mapping between depth and stack size.”  
4. **Walk through an example**: Show how `depth=2` leads to popping two nodes.  
5. **Complexity**: Cite `O(n)` time, `O(h)` space.  
6. **Edge‑case testing**: Ask if the interviewer wants you to cover skewed trees or large values.  
7. **Mention testing**: Provide unit tests in your code editor to ensure correctness.

---

### 4.12 Final Thoughts & Further Reading

*LeetCode 1028* is more than a string‑parsing puzzle; it’s a window into how **structured data** can be serialized and deserialized efficiently. Mastery here translates to:

- Efficient log‑processing pipelines  
- Hierarchical UI frameworks  
- Distributed file systems (HDFS)  

**Next Steps:**
- Practice *Tree serialization* (LeetCode serialize and deserialize binary tree).  
- Explore *prefix/postfix notation* parsing for arithmetic expressions.  
- Study *Euler tours* and *heavy‑light decomposition* for advanced tree queries.
