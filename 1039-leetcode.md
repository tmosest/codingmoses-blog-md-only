## 🔍 Problem Summary

> **Given a convex polygon with `n` vertices, each vertex has an integer value.**  
> Divide the polygon into `n‑2` triangles so that the sum of the products of the values of the vertices of each triangle is **minimal**.

The input is an array `values` of length `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ values[i] ≤ 100).  
Return the minimum possible total score.

> **Why it’s a classic interview question**  
> – Combines geometry (triangulation) with dynamic programming.  
> – It’s a perfect example of “divide‑and‑conquer” on a 1‑D structure.  
> – Many top‑tech companies use it in coding interviews (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.).

## 💡 Key Idea – A Matrix‑Chain Multiplication Twist

If you imagine a triangle formed by vertices `i`, `j`, `k` (`i < k < j`), the score contributed by that triangle is

```
values[i] * values[j] * values[k]
```

When you split the polygon at `k`, the remaining left part `(i … k)` and right part `(k … j)` are independent sub‑problems.  
Thus the recurrence is:

```
dp[i][j] = min over k ( dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i]*values[j]*values[k] )
```

**Base case** – If there are only two vertices (`i+1 == j`), you cannot form a triangle, so the cost is 0.

This is literally the same recurrence as the classic *Matrix Chain Multiplication* DP (hence the name), except the “cost” is a product of three numbers instead of a matrix multiplication count.

## 🚀 3‑Language Code

Below are clean, production‑ready implementations.  
All three use the *bottom‑up* DP because it is easy to read and has no recursion depth concerns.

### 1. Java – `Solution` class for LeetCode

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int minScoreTriangulation(int[] values) {
        int n = values.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];

        // dp[i][j] is 0 for i+1 == j by default (two vertices, no triangle)
        for (int len = 3; len <= n; len++) {          // sub‑polygon length
            for (int i = 0; i + len <= n; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                int best = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                for (int k = i + 1; k < j; k++) {
                    int cost = dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i] * values[j] * values[k];
                    if (cost < best) best = cost;
                }
                dp[i][j] = best;
            }
        }
        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }

    /* ---------   Simple main for local testing   --------- */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] values = {3,7,4,5};
        System.out.println(new Solution().minScoreTriangulation(values)); // 144
    }
}
```

---

### 2. Python – LeetCode style

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minScoreTriangulation(self, values: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(values)
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

        for length in range(3, n + 1):          # sub‑polygon length
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1
                best = float('inf')
                for k in range(i + 1, j):
                    cost = dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i] * values[j] * values[k]
                    if cost < best:
                        best = cost
                dp[i][j] = best
        return dp[0][n - 1]


# ---------- local test ----------
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    print(sol.minScoreTriangulation([3, 7, 4, 5]))  # 144
```

---

### 3. C++ – `Solution` class

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minScoreTriangulation(vector<int>& values) {
        int n = values.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));

        for (int len = 3; len <= n; ++len) {          // sub‑polygon length
            for (int i = 0; i + len <= n; ++i) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                int best = INT_MAX;
                for (int k = i + 1; k < j; ++k) {
                    int cost = dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] +
                               values[i] * values[j] * values[k];
                    best = min(best, cost);
                }
                dp[i][j] = best;
            }
        }
        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }
};

/* ---------   Local test   --------- */
int main() {
    vector<int> v = {3,7,4,5};
    Solution s;
    cout << s.minScoreTriangulation(v) << endl;  // 144
    return 0;
}
```

## ⏱ Complexity

| Approach | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| Bottom‑up DP | **O(n³)** | **O(n²)** |
| Top‑down memo | **O(n³)** | **O(n²)** (recursion stack negligible for n ≤ 50) |

With `n ≤ 50`, this easily fits into the time limits of any modern interview platform.

---

## ⚠️ Gotchas

| Pitfall | Why it matters | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| Off‑by‑one errors in loops | `i+1 == j` should be the base case | Explicit `continue` or start loops at `len = 3` |
| Integer overflow (in languages with 32‑bit ints) | Product of three numbers up to 100 → 1,000,000 < 2³¹ | Still safe, but use `long long` in C++ if values were larger |
| Mutable default values in Python lists | All rows reference the same list if `dp = [[0]*n]*n` | Use list comprehension `[[0]*n for _ in range(n)]` |
| Recursion depth limit in Python | Python recursion limit ~1000, safe for n = 50 | Prefer bottom‑up or set `sys.setrecursionlimit` |

---

## 💪 Variants & Extensions

| Problem | Core Change |
|---------|-------------|
| **Maximum Triangulation Score** | Replace `min` with `max` |
| **Polygon with holes** | DP becomes more complex; you need to handle multiple chains |
| **Matrix Chain Multiplication** | Same DP structure, but cost is `p[i-1]*p[i]*p[j]` |
| **Weighted Polygon Triangulation** | Add vertex weights to the product |

These variants are often asked in *advanced* interviews or in coding competitions like ACM‑ICPC.
