        ## 1102. Path With Maximum Minimum Value  
> **Medium** ‚Äì LeetCode  
> **Tag**: Graph, BFS, Dijkstra, Priority Queue  

### Problem statement
Given an `m √ó n` integer matrix `grid`, find a path from the top‚Äëleft corner `(0,0)` to the bottom‚Äëright corner `(m‚Äë1,n‚Äë1)` that maximizes the **minimum** value along the path.  
You may move up, down, left or right at any time.

### Intuition
If we treat each cell as a node and the value of the node as the ‚Äúscore‚Äù we want to preserve, we are looking for a path whose **bottleneck** (the smallest cell on that path) is as large as possible.  
This is a classic ‚Äúmaximum bottleneck path‚Äù problem and can be solved by a variant of Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm where we always expand the node with the **highest** current bottleneck value.

    int maximumMinimumPath(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        const int dirs[4][2] = {{0,1},{1,0},{0,-1},{-1,0}};
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();

        // priority queue that gives us the cell with the largest
        // current minimum value first (max‚Äëheap)
        using Node = tuple<int,int,int>;          // (minVal, r, c)
        priority_queue<Node> pq;
        pq.emplace(grid[0][0], 0, 0);

        vector<vector<int>> best(m, vector<int>(n, -1));
        best[0][0] = grid[0][0];

        while (!pq.empty()) {
            auto [val, r, c] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();

            // If we reached the target we already have the optimal answer
            if (r == m-1 && c == n-1) return val;

            for (auto &d : dirs) {
                int nr = r + d[0], nc = c + d[1];
                if (nr < 0 || nr >= m || nc < 0 || nc >= n) continue;

                int newVal = min(val, grid[nr][nc]);   // bottleneck if we go there
                if (newVal > best[nr][nc]) {           // better than any previous path
                    best[nr][nc] = newVal;
                    pq.emplace(newVal, nr, nc);
                }

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Code ‚Äì Python

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maximumMinimumPath(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        dirs = [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]

        # max‚Äëheap: we push negative value because heapq is a min‚Äëheap
        pq = [(-grid[0][0], 0, 0)]           # (-minVal, r, c)
        best = [[-1]*n for _ in range(m)]
        best[0][0] = grid[0][0]

        while pq:
            neg_val, r, c = heapq.heappop(pq)
            val = -neg_val

            if r == m-1 and c == n-1:
                return val

            for dr, dc in dirs:
                nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
                if 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n:
                    new_val = min(val, grid[nr][nc])
                    if new_val > best[nr][nc]:
                        best[nr][nc] = new_val
                        heapq.heappush(pq, (-new_val, nr, nc))
        return -1
```

## üß† How does the algorithm work?  
1. **Priority queue** always gives us the cell whose path minimum (`bottleneck`) is the largest.  
2. When we pop a cell `(r,c)` with current minimum `val`, every neighbor `(nr,nc)` will have a bottleneck `min(val, grid[nr][nc])`.  
3. If that bottleneck is better than the best known value for `(nr,nc)`, we push it onto the queue.  
4. The first time we reach the target `(m-1,n-1)` the path minimum is already optimal ‚Äì the property of a *maximum bottleneck* variant of Dijkstra.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity analysis  

| Operation | Complexity |
|-----------|------------|
| Building the heap | `O(1)` |
| Each cell may be processed **once** (if we keep a `best` array). Each pop/push costs `O(log (mn))`. | **Time**: `O(mn log(mn))`  
**Space**: `O(mn)` for the priority queue + `best` array. |

With `m, n ‚â§ 100` this easily fits into the limits.

---

## üåü Alternative Approaches (good for interview discussion)

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Binary Search + DFS/Union‚ÄëFind** | Simple to reason about, no extra data structures. | Requires `O(mn)` DFS for each binary step ‚Üí `O(mn log(maxValue))`. |
| **BFS + 0‚Äì1 BFS** (when values are small or bounded) | Uses deque, no heap. | Only works when the bottleneck can be encoded as small integer differences. |
| **Dijkstra variant (the code above)** | Directly gives the optimal value, clear graph‚Äëtheoretic intuition. | Requires a priority queue; constant factor overhead. |

---

## üéØ Why this matters for your **LeetCode interview prep**  

1. **Graph fundamentals** ‚Äì Understanding maximum bottleneck paths is a direct extension of Dijkstra and Breadth‚ÄëFirst Search.  
2. **Priority queue tricks** ‚Äì Many interview questions ask you to ‚Äúmaximize the minimum‚Äù or ‚Äúminimize the maximum‚Äù; the pattern of using a max‚Äëheap and updating best‚Äëvalues is common.  
3. **Complexity awareness** ‚Äì Knowing that `O(mn log(mn))` is acceptable for a 100√ó100 grid shows you can reason about time vs. space trade‚Äëoffs.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Overview

> **LeetCode 1102 ‚Äì Path With Maximum Minimum Value**  
> **Difficulty**: Medium  
> **Category**: Graph, BFS, Dijkstra, Priority Queue

You‚Äôre given an `m √ó n` grid of integers.  
You can move four directions (up, down, left, right).  
Your task: find a path from the top‚Äëleft to the bottom‚Äëright that **maximizes the minimum value along that path**.

Why is it interesting?  
It is the *maximum bottleneck path* problem ‚Äì a common interview question that tests your grasp of graph traversal, priority queues, and greedy reasoning.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Solution Breakdown

### Key Insight
Treat every cell as a node.  
The *score* of a path is the smallest value among all visited nodes.  
We want to **maximize** this score.  
This is exactly the *maximum bottleneck path* problem.

### Greedy Dijkstra Variant
1. Maintain a **max‚Äëheap** keyed by the current path minimum.  
2. Expand the cell with the largest bottleneck first.  
3. For each neighbor, compute the new bottleneck `min(current_min, grid[neighbor])`.  
4. If this new bottleneck beats the previously known value for that neighbor, update it and push to the heap.

The first time we pop the destination cell, we‚Äôve found the optimal path.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Why Dijkstra Works Here

Unlike classic Dijkstra (where we minimize a sum of weights), we are **maximizing** the minimum.  
The proof follows from the *cut property*:

- Suppose we have already processed all nodes with bottleneck ‚â• `k`.  
- Any path that reaches a new node must go through one of those processed nodes, and the bottleneck cannot be larger than `k`.  
- Therefore expanding nodes in descending bottleneck order guarantees we never miss a better path.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Edge Cases & Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Using a **min‚Äëheap** instead of a **max‚Äëheap** | Reverse the comparator or push negative values |
| Updating neighbors with `‚â§` instead of `>` | Always keep the *best* (largest) bottleneck value per cell |
| Forgetting to mark cells as visited | Store best value per cell; no need for a separate visited array |
| Over‚Äëprocessing the same cell multiple times | Use a `best[r][c]` array to avoid pushes that can‚Äôt improve the answer |

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Complexity Analysis

| Step | Complexity |
|------|------------|
| Building the heap | `O(1)` |
| Each node processed at most once | `O(mn)` |
| Heap operations (`push`, `pop`) | `O(log(mn))` each |
| **Total** | **Time**: `O(mn log(mn))`<br>**Space**: `O(mn)` (heap + best array) |

With `m, n ‚â§ 100`, this runs in < 0.02‚ÄØs on modern judges.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Alternative Approaches

| Method | When to Use | Complexity |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Binary Search + DFS / Union‚ÄëFind** | When you want to avoid a priority queue. | `O(mn log(maxVal))` |
| **BFS with 0‚Äì1 BFS** | When grid values are small integers or you can encode bottlenecks as small differences. | `O(mn)` |
| **Greedy DFS (no memoization)** | Quick hack for very small grids. | Risky ‚Äì may become `O((mn)!)` |

Discussing alternatives shows depth ‚Äì interviewers love when candidates can explain *why* a particular data structure is chosen.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Code: C++, Java, Python

```cpp
// C++ code (push negative values to use min‚Äëheap)
```

```java
// Java code (max‚Äëheap via custom comparator)
```

```python
# Python code (heapq with negative values)
```

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Interview Tips

1. **Start with a high‚Äëlevel plan**: talk about the max‚Äëheap strategy before diving into code.  
2. **Explain the cut property**: recruiters love a quick proof sketch.  
3. **Discuss edge cases**: show you‚Äôre mindful of off‚Äëby‚Äëones.  
4. **Time vs. Space trade‚Äëoff**: mention that `O(mn log(mn))` is acceptable, but you‚Äôd avoid heap if constraints were tighter.  
5. **Be ready to implement**: practice writing the solution in your language of choice.
