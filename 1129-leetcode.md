        ## 1. 3‑Language Solution to **LeetCode 1129 – Shortest Path with Alternating Colors**

The goal: from node 0 find the shortest distance to every node `x` when **no two consecutive edges have the same color** (red ↔ blue).  
If a node can’t be reached under that rule, the answer is `-1`.

The classic way is **Breadth‑First Search (BFS)** that keeps track of the *last used edge color*.

Below are clean, ready‑to‑copy implementations in **Java, Python, and C++**.

### 1.1  Java (Java 17)

```java
import java.util.*;

/**
 * LeetCode 1129 – Shortest Path with Alternating Colors
 */
public class Solution {

    /** enum for the two edge colors and a special “initial” state */
    private enum Color { INIT, RED, BLUE }

    public int[] shortestAlternatingPaths(int n, int[][] redEdges, int[][] blueEdges) {
        // adjacency list: node -> list of (neighbor, edgeColor)
        List<List<int[]>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) graph.add(new ArrayList<>());

        for (int[] e : redEdges)   graph.get(e[0]).add(new int[]{e[1], Color.RED.ordinal()});
        for (int[] e : blueEdges)  graph.get(e[0]).add(new int[]{e[1], Color.BLUE.ordinal()});

        int[] dist = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(dist, -1);                     // -1 = not visited yet
        dist[0] = 0;

        // queue holds (node, lastColor)
        Deque<int[]> q = new ArrayDeque<>();
        q.offer(new int[]{0, Color.INIT.ordinal()});

        // visited[node][color] = true if we've already processed this state
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[n][3];
        visited[0][Color.INIT.ordinal()] = true;

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int[] cur = q.poll();
            int u   = cur[0];
            int col = cur[1];
            int step = dist[u] + 1;

            for (int[] edge : graph.get(u)) {
                int v   = edge[0];
                int ec  = edge[1];
                // we can only traverse if the edge color differs from the last used one
                if (ec == col) continue;
                if (visited[v][ec]) continue;

                visited[v][ec] = true;
                if (dist[v] == -1) dist[v] = step;
                q.offer(new int[]{v, ec});
            }
        }

        return dist;
    }

    /* ----- quick test harness ----- */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution s = new Solution();
        int n = 3;
        int[][] red = {{0,1},{1,2}};
        int[][] blue = {};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(s.shortestAlternatingPaths(n, red, blue)));
        // Expected: [0, 1, -1]
    }
}
```

**Complexities**

| Complexity | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| **O(n + E)** | Each node + edge is processed once per color. |
| **O(n + E)** | Extra arrays for adjacency, distance, visited. |

        dist = [-1] * n

### 2.1  Introduction

The “Shortest Path with Alternating Colors” problem is a favorite on LeetCode’s interview section. It tests two core skills that recruiters care about:

1. **Graph traversal** – especially BFS with state.
2. **State management** – remembering the last edge color so you don’t traverse two red or two blue edges consecutively.

If you nail this problem, you’ll have a strong talking point in your next interview. Below, we walk through the *good*, the *bad*, and the *ugly* aspects of the solution, and provide ready‑to‑copy code in **Java, Python, and C++**.

---

### 2.2  Problem Recap

> **Input**  
> `n`: number of nodes (0‑based).  
> `redEdges`: list of directed red edges `[u, v]`.  
> `blueEdges`: list of directed blue edges `[u, v]`.

> **Output**  
> An array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[x]` is the length of the shortest path from node 0 to node x, **alternating colors**, or `-1` if impossible.

> **Constraints**  
> `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, edges ≤ 400 each.

---

### 2.3  The Good – Why BFS is the Right Tool

1. **Layered Exploration**  
   BFS naturally discovers the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores all nodes at distance `k` before moving to `k+1`.

2. **State Encoding**  
   By attaching the “last edge color” to each queued state, we keep the search *color‑aware* without blowing up the graph size.

3. **Simplicity & Readability**  
   The algorithm is a few lines long, and the complexity is linear in the number of edges. Recruiters love clean code that shows you can solve a problem efficiently.

4. **Language Agnostic**  
   The same BFS‑with‑color‑state strategy works unchanged in Java, Python, or C++ – a great illustration of language‑agnostic thinking.

---

### 2.4  The Bad – Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | What Happens | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Treating “no previous color” as 0 or 1** | The initial node can take any color; if you treat init as 0, you’ll mistakenly block the first red edge. | Use a third “INIT” state or use `-1` for “no color.” |
| **Duplicate Edge Processing** | Without a visited matrix per color, the same node can be enqueued infinitely. | Keep `visited[node][color]`. |
| **Incorrect Distance Update** | Updating `dist[v]` on every visit may set a longer distance later. | Only set `dist[v]` when the first time you visit that node (regardless of color). |

---

### 2.5  The Ugly – Edge Cases that Obscure the Logic

| Ugly Case | Why it’s confusing | How to guard |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Two colors meeting at the same node** | `redEdges = [[0,1],[1,2]]`, `blueEdges = [[0,2]]` – you must start with red, then blue, then red again. | Explicitly check `ec != last` before traversal. |
| **Large number of parallel edges** | Red edges can be duplicated, or red and blue may point to the same pair. | Use a visited matrix to avoid re‑processing the same `(node,color)` pair. |
| **Self‑loops** | An edge `[u,u]` of any color can be traversed, but if it’s the first edge, you can’t take a second same‑color loop. | The same color‑difference rule applies; self‑loops won’t break BFS. |

---

### 2.6  Step‑by‑Step Algorithm

1. **Build the adjacency list**  
   `adj[u] = list of (v, color)`. Color: 0 = red, 1 = blue.

2. **Initialize**  
   `dist[0] = 0`, all others `-1`.  
   Queue starts with `(0, INIT)`.

3. **BFS Loop**  
   ```
   while queue not empty:
       u, lastColor = queue.pop()
       nextDist = dist[u] + 1
       for (v, edgeColor) in adj[u]:
           if edgeColor == lastColor: continue
           if visited[v][edgeColor]: continue
           visited[v][edgeColor] = true
           if dist[v] == -1: dist[v] = nextDist
           queue.push((v, edgeColor))
   ```

4. **Return** `dist`.

The key is that each node may be reached twice (once via red, once via blue). That’s why we keep a 3‑column `visited` matrix (`INIT` too).

### 2.7  Ready‑to‑Copy Code – Three Languages

> **Java**  
> [See above implementation](#1.1)

> **Python**  
> [See above implementation](#1.2)

> **C++**  
> [See above implementation](#1.3)

Copy the class, drop it into your IDE, and run the `main` demos. You’ll be ready to discuss this in an interview.

---

### 2.8  Tips for Your Interview

1. **Talk About Complexity**  
   “The BFS runs in `O(n+E)` time and `O(n+E)` space. With `n ≤ 100`, that’s trivial for interviewers.”

2. **State Justification**  
   “We attach the last color to the state so we enforce alternation. This is similar to solving the *“road trip with fuel types”* problem.”

3. **Edge Cases**  
   Mention: *If `redEdges` or `blueEdges` is empty, we still find a path using the other color or return `-1`.*

4. **Explain Why `-1`**  
   “If we never set `dist[v]`, the node is unreachable under the alternation constraint.”

---

### 2.9  Why This Boosts Your Job Search

- **Problem Solving**: Show recruiters you can design an efficient solution for a non‑trivial graph problem.
- **Coding Style**: Clean BFS code demonstrates readability, which is a big plus in pair‑programming interviews.
- **Language Flexibility**: Having solutions in Java, Python, and C++ proves you’re not just a “one‑language” coder.
- **Confidence**: Knowing how to discuss stateful BFS will help you tackle similar interview questions (e.g., *“Shortest Path with K‑color changes”*, *“Minimum number of steps to reach target”*).

---

### 2.10  Conclusion

The **Shortest Path with Alternating Colors** problem is more than a coding exercise; it’s a showcase of algorithmic maturity.  
By mastering the BFS‑with‑state pattern and being able to explain the *good* design choices, you’ll stand out in technical interviews and gain a real edge in your job hunt.
