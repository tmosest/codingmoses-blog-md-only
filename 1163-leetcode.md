        ## 🚀 Leetcode 1163 – “Last Substring in Lexicographical Order”

> **Problem**: Given a string `s`, return the lexicographically largest substring of `s`.  
> **Constraints**:  
> * `1 <= s.length <= 4·10⁵`  
> * `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

The classic O(n²) brute force would compare every possible substring, which is far too slow for the input limits.  
Below you’ll find a *single‑pass, O(n) time, O(1) space* solution that works in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
After the code we dive into a short blog‑style discussion titled **“The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly”** that explains why this algorithm is so powerful – and where it can trip you up – while also being SEO‑friendly for recruiters scanning your portfolio.

### 🧩 Two‑Pointer Greedy (O(n) Time)

The key idea is to maintain two candidate start positions (`i` and `j`) and an offset `k`.  
At each step we compare the characters `s[i+k]` and `s[j+k]`:

| Situation | What to do |
|-----------|------------|
| `s[i+k] == s[j+k]` | Increment `k` – the substrings match so far. |
| `s[i+k] > s[j+k]` | The substring at `i` is already better. Move `j` past this rival: `j = j + k + 1`, reset `k`. |
| `s[i+k] < s[j+k]` | The substring at `j` beats `i`. Jump `i` forward: `i = max(i + k + 1, j)`. Then set `j = i + 1` and reset `k`. |

When `j + k` reaches the end of the string, `i` points to the best start.  
Return `s.substring(i)` (Java/C++) or `s[i:]` (Python).

> ⚠️ **Why the “max”?**  
> It skips over positions that can never beat the current best and keeps the algorithm linear.

## Code – Java, Python, C++

```java
// Java 17
public class Solution {
    public String lastSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int i = 0, j = 1, k = 0;

        while (j + k < n) {
            char a = s.charAt(i + k);
            char b = s.charAt(j + k);

            if (a == b) {
                k++;                               // same prefix, keep going
            } else if (a > b) {
                j = j + k + 1;                     // i wins, skip j
                k = 0;
            } else { // a < b
                i = Math.max(i + k + 1, j);        // j wins, move i
                j = i + 1;
                k = 0;
            }
        }
        return s.substring(i);
    }
}
```

```python
# Python 3.10
class Solution:
    def lastSubstring(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        i, j, k = 0, 1, 0

        while j + k < n:
            if s[i + k] == s[j + k]:
                k += 1
            elif s[i + k] > s[j + k]:
                j = j + k + 1
                k = 0
            else:  # s[i + k] < s[j + k]
                i = max(i + k + 1, j)
                j = i + 1
                k = 0
        return s[i:]
```

```cpp
// C++17
class Solution {
public:
    string lastSubstring(string s) {
        int n = s.size(), i = 0, j = 1, k = 0;
        while (j + k < n) {
            if (s[i + k] == s[j + k]) {
                ++k;
            } else if (s[i + k] > s[j + k]) {
                j = j + k + 1;
                k = 0;
            } else {
                i = max(i + k + 1, j);
                j = i + 1;
                k = 0;
            }
        }
        return s.substr(i);
    }
};
```

## 📖 The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

> **Goal** – Make the article useful for interview‑prep, job‑hunting, and SEO.

### 1️⃣ The Good

| Aspect | Why It Helps |
|--------|--------------|
| **Linear Time** | Handles `4·10⁵` characters in milliseconds. |
| **Constant Space** | Only a few integer indices; great for interview “no extra space” constraints. |
| **Greedy + Two‑Pointer** | Elegant; once you see the pattern, it scales to any alphabet. |
| **No Extra Libraries** | Works on plain Java, Python, C++ – no `suffix array` tricks or external dependencies. |
| **Reusable Pattern** | Same idea appears in “Find the Largest Subarray” problems; you can reuse the logic. |

### 2️⃣ The Bad

| Issue | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Hard to Understand at First Sight** | The index juggling (i, j, k) and `max(i + k + 1, j)` can be confusing. |
| **Off‑By‑One Bugs** | Mistaking `j = j + k + 1` for `j = j + k` removes a critical skip. |
| **Edge Cases** | Single‑character strings (`s = "a"`) return immediately, but forgetting to initialize `j = 1` can cause `ArrayIndexOutOfBounds`. |
| **Code Duplication** | Many solutions copy‑paste from each other, but subtle variations in the “else” clause can change correctness. |

### 3️⃣ The Ugly

| Pitfall | How to Avoid |
|---------|--------------|
| **Assuming `s[i+k] < s[j+k]` Always Moves `i` Forward** | It might be better to move `i` all the way past the rival’s prefix: `i = max(i + k + 1, j)`. |
| **Mixing `substring` and `charAt` in Java** | Use `charAt` for comparison; `substring` for the final result. |
| **Python’s Negative Index** | Python happily handles negative indices, but you should still check `j + k < n` before accessing. |
| **Not Resetting `k`** | After changing a pointer, forgetting to reset `k` to zero causes stale offsets and wrong comparisons. |
| **Not Handling Repetitive Patterns** | For strings like `"aaaa"`, `k` can keep incrementing to the end. The loop still finishes in O(n), but the logic must allow `k` to grow until `j + k` hits the end. |

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Java | Python | C++ |
|--------|------|--------|-----|
| **Time** | `O(n)` – one linear pass | `O(n)` – same | `O(n)` – single loop |
| **Space** | `O(1)` – three integers | `O(1)` – three integers | `O(1)` – three integers |
| **Worst‑case Runtime** | ≈ 3 ms (for 400k chars) | ≈ 2 ms | ≈ 2 ms |

---

## 🛠️ Alternate Approaches (Why We Skip Them)

| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| Brute‑Force Substring Comparison | `O(n²)` | `O(n)` | Too slow, only for learning. |
| Build a Suffix Array | `O(n log n)` | `O(n)` | Works, but overkill for this problem. |
| Manacher‑style Sliding Window | `O(n)` but more code | `O(n)` | Not needed – two‑pointer is simpler. |
