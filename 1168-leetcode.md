# 🎯 LeetCode 1168 – “Optimize Water Distribution in a Village”
> **Job‑Ready Guide** – Master MST, Prim’s & Kruskal’s, and win that interview!

---

## 1. Problem Recap (SEO Keywords: *LeetCode 1168*, *Optimize Water Distribution*, *Minimum Cost to Supply Water*)

You are given:

| Item | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `n` | Number of houses (1‑indexed) |
| `wells[i]` | Cost of digging a well at house *i+1* |
| `pipes[j] = [u, v, cost]` | Cost to lay a pipe between houses *u* and *v* |

**Goal**: Supply water to *every* house with the minimum total cost.  
You can dig wells in any subset of houses and/or lay pipes between houses.

---

## 2. Why This Problem Is a *Golden Interview Question*

- **Graph theory** (weighted undirected graph)
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** concept
- Two classic MST algorithms: **Prim** & **Kruskal**
- Real‑world engineering mindset – *network optimization*

Mastering this problem demonstrates your ability to:

1. Transform a practical problem into a graph model.
2. Choose the right algorithmic strategy.
3. Optimize time‑space trade‑offs.
4. Discuss edge‑cases and performance.

---

## 3. Solution Overview

Add a **virtual node 0** that represents “water source”.  
Connect node 0 to every house `i` with an edge of weight `wells[i-1]`.  
All original pipes remain as edges between houses.

The problem now is:  
> *Find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of this augmented graph.*

Both **Prim** and **Kruskal** give O(E log V) time.

### 3.1  Prim’s Algorithm (Heap‑Based)

```
- Build adjacency list for n+1 nodes (including 0).
- Start from node 0, push all edges (0, i) into a min‑heap.
- Repeatedly pop the smallest edge that connects a new node.
- Accumulate the weight; stop when all n+1 nodes are visited.
```

### 3.2  Kruskal’s Algorithm (Union‑Find)

```
- Create a list of all edges: (0,i,wells[i-1]) + all pipes.
- Sort edges by weight.
- Use Union‑Find to add edges that connect disjoint components.
- Stop when n edges have been added (MST complete).
```

Both solutions are concise and fit within LeetCode’s constraints.

## 4. Code Implementations

### 4.1 Java (Prim’s Algorithm)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minCostToSupplyWater(int n, int[] wells, int[][] pipes) {
        // Build graph
        List<List<int[]>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        // Add virtual node 0 edges
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.get(0).add(new int[]{i + 1, wells[i]});
        }
        // Add pipe edges (bidirectional)
        for (int[] p : pipes) {
            graph.get(p[0]).add(new int[]{p[1], p[2]});
            graph.get(p[1]).add(new int[]{p[0], p[2]});
        }

        // Prim's algorithm
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n + 1];
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));
        // Start from virtual node 0
        for (int[] e : graph.get(0)) pq.offer(e);
        visited[0] = true;

        int totalCost = 0;
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] edge = pq.poll();
            int node = edge[0];
            int cost = edge[1];
            if (visited[node]) continue;
            visited[node] = true;
            totalCost += cost;
            for (int[] nb : graph.get(node)) {
                if (!visited[nb[0]]) pq.offer(nb);
            }
        }
        return totalCost;
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Python (Kruskal’s Algorithm)

```python
class DSU:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, a, b):
        ra, rb = self.find(a), self.find(b)
        if ra == rb:
            return False
        if self.rank[ra] < self.rank[rb]:
            self.parent[ra] = rb
        elif self.rank[ra] > self.rank[rb]:
            self.parent[rb] = ra
        else:
            self.parent[rb] = ra
            self.rank[ra] += 1
        return True


class Solution:
    def minCostToSupplyWater(self, n: int, wells: List[int], pipes: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        edges = []
        # Virtual node 0
        for i, w in enumerate(wells):
            edges.append((0, i + 1, w))
        # Original pipes
        for u, v, cost in pipes:
            edges.append((u, v, cost))

        # Sort edges by cost
        edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])

        dsu = DSU(n + 1)
        mst_cost = 0
        added = 0

        for u, v, w in edges:
            if dsu.union(u, v):
                mst_cost += w
                added += 1
                if added == n:          # MST complete (n edges)
                    break
        return mst_cost
```

### 4.3 C++ (Prim’s Algorithm – `O(n)` heap)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minCostToSupplyWater(int n, vector<int>& wells, vector<vector<int>>& pipes) {
        // adjacency list: node 0..n
        vector<vector<pair<int,int>>> adj(n + 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            adj[0].push_back({i + 1, wells[i]});
        }
        for (auto &p : pipes) {
            adj[p[0]].push_back({p[1], p[2]});
            adj[p[1]].push_back({p[0], p[2]});
        }

        vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);
        priority_queue<pair<int,int>, vector<pair<int,int>>, greater<pair<int,int>>> pq;
        // Start from virtual node 0
        for (auto &e : adj[0]) pq.push({e.first, e.second});
        visited[0] = true;

        int total = 0;
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            auto [node, cost] = pq.top(); pq.pop();
            if (visited[node]) continue;
            visited[node] = true;
            total += cost;
            for (auto &nb : adj[node]) {
                if (!visited[nb.first]) pq.push(nb);
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
};
```

## 1. Problem Statement

> **Input**  
> • `n` – houses (1‑indexed)  
> • `wells[i]` – well cost at house `i+1`  
> • `pipes[j] = [u, v, cost]` – pipe cost between houses `u` and `v`  

> **Output** – Minimum total cost to supply water to every house.

---

## 2. Naïve Approaches & Why They Fail

| Approach | Time | Why It Breaks |
|----------|------|---------------|
| **Brute‑Force Subset** | 2ⁿ | `n` can be 10⁴ – impossible. |
| **Dynamic Programming (DP)** | O(n³) | Doesn’t capture the network connectivity. |
| **Greedy without MST** | O(n²) | Ignores the combinatorial nature of pipes. |

> **Bottom line**: The problem is a *graph* optimization – we need a *global* optimal solution.

---

## 3. Graph Transformation – The Secret Trick

Add **node 0** (“water source”) and connect it to every house:

```
Edge (0, i) with weight = wells[i-1]
```

All pipes stay the same.  
Now *every* edge has a positive weight, and we simply need the **MST** of this graph.

---

## 4. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

> **Definition**: A tree that connects all vertices with the smallest possible total edge weight.

- **Why MST?**  
  The water supply network must be *connected* (each house receives water) and *acyclic* (no redundant pipes).  
  An MST satisfies exactly those constraints.

- **Algorithms**  
  - **Prim** – starts from a vertex, grows the tree.  
  - **Kruskal** – sorts edges, joins components.

Both run in `O(E log V)` – with `E ≈ n + number_of_pipes`.

---

## 5. Prim’s Algorithm (Heap‑Based) – Detailed Walkthrough

1. **Build adjacency list** for `n+1` vertices (`0` + `1..n`).
2. **Initialize** a min‑heap (`PriorityQueue`) with all edges from node 0.
3. **Mark** node 0 as visited.
4. While the heap isn’t empty:
   * Pop the smallest edge `(u, v, w)`.
   * If `v` is already visited → skip.
   * Mark `v` visited, add `w` to answer.
   * Push all edges from `v` to the heap (only those leading to unvisited nodes).
5. Stop when all `n` houses (plus node 0) are visited.

> **Complexity**: `O((n + m) log n)` time, `O(n + m)` space.  
> `m` = number of pipes.

---

## 6. Kruskal’s Algorithm (Union‑Find) – Alternative View

1. **Collect edges**:  
   * `(0, i, wells[i-1])` for each house.  
   * All original pipes.
2. **Sort** edges by weight.
3. **Initialize** Union‑Find for `n+1` nodes.
4. Traverse sorted edges:  
   * If endpoints belong to different sets → `union` and add weight to answer.  
   * Stop after adding `n` edges (tree has `n+1` vertices → `n` edges).
5. Return total cost.

> **Why use Union‑Find?**  
> Keeps track of connected components in nearly O(α(n)) per operation.

---

## 7. Complexity Analysis

| Algorithm | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Prim (Heap) | `O((n + m) log n)` | `O(n + m)` |
| Kruskal (Union‑Find) | `O((n + m) log (n + m))` | `O(n + m)` |

Both satisfy LeetCode’s limits (`n ≤ 10⁴`, `m ≤ 10⁴`).

---

## 8. The Good, the Bad & the Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Modeling** | ✅ Adds virtual node → clean graph | ❌ Forgetting the virtual node leads to wrong MST | ⚠️ Mis‑indexing (0‑ vs 1‑based) can break tests |
| **Algorithm Choice** | ✅ Prim or Kruskal both fine | ❌ Over‑optimizing with a custom data structure when a heap/UF suffices | ⚠️ Implementing Kruskal without path compression → O(n²) |
| **Code Clarity** | ✅ Uses standard library (`PriorityQueue`, `sort`) | ❌ Mixing data structures inside a single method can obscure intent | ⚠️ Recursion in DFS/UF without tail‑call optimization → stack overflow for deep graphs |
| **Testing** | ✅ Verify against sample cases and random generators | ❌ Forgetting to test empty pipes list | ⚠️ Edge case: all wells cheaper than any pipe – MST must pick all well edges |

---

## 9. Interview‑Ready Tips

1. **Start with a clear graph diagram** – draw houses, wells, pipes, and virtual node.
2. **Explain the MST reduction** – why a tree of minimum total cost gives the optimal solution.
3. **State your algorithm choice** – discuss trade‑offs between Prim (online, useful for dense graphs) and Kruskal (offline, good when edges are sorted).
4. **Mention complexities** – interviewer appreciates awareness of performance.
5. **Show a quick hand‑run** on a small example to demonstrate understanding.
5. **Ask clarifying questions** – e.g., “What if `m` is much larger than `n`?” → leads to discussing Prim’s advantage.

---

## 10. TL;DR

- Add a virtual node (node 0) to connect all houses via well edges.  
- Compute the MST of this graph – the answer is the minimum cost.  
- Use **Prim** with a min‑heap for an online, concise solution.  
- Alternative: **Kruskal** with Union‑Find if you prefer an edge‑sorted approach.  
- Keep indices consistent, use path compression & union by rank, and test thoroughly.
