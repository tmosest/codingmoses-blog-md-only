        ## 🎯 1227. Airplane Seat Assignment Probability  
**Medium | LeetCode | Interview‑Ready**

> **Problem**  
> There are `n` passengers and `n` seats.  
> 1️⃣ The first passenger lost his ticket and picks a seat at random.  
> 2️⃣ Every subsequent passenger sits in his own seat if it’s free; otherwise, he chooses a random free seat.  
> Return the probability that the `n`‑th passenger gets his own seat.

### 1️⃣ Why Is This Problem “Classical”?

It’s a textbook example of a *probability puzzle* that turns out to have an elegant closed‑form answer.  
- For `n = 1` the answer is trivially `1`.  
- For any `n ≥ 2` the probability that the last passenger gets his own seat is exactly `0.5`.

You can prove this via induction or a clever symmetry argument. The most popular solution is a one‑liner in **O(1)** time and **O(1)** space.

## 📌 The Good

| ✅ | Description |
|----|-------------|
| **Simplicity** | One line of code, no loops, no recursion. |
| **Performance** | `O(1)` time, `O(1)` memory – trivial even for `n = 10⁵`. |
| **Clarity** | Clear intent: `return n == 1 ? 1.0 : 0.5;`. |
| **Cross‑Language** | Easy to translate to Java, Python, C++. |

---

## ⚠️ The Bad

| ❌ | Description |
|----|-------------|
| **Misleading Induction** | Some solutions over‑complicate the proof, adding unnecessary DP arrays or stack frames. |
| **Floating‑Point Edge Cases** | Returning an `int` instead of a `double` (in Java) can lead to compile errors. |
| **Testing Ignorance** | Not verifying the base case (`n == 1`) can produce wrong results for that corner case. |

---

## 💀 The Ugly

| 🦄 | Description |
|----|-------------|
| **One‑Liner With Side Effects** | Using a trick like `return (n <= 1) ? 1.0 : 0.5;` but forgetting to cast to `double` in some languages. |
| **Premature Optimization** | Unnecessary `if (n == 1) return 1.0;` in a loop that never iterates. |
| **Hard‑Coded Constants** | Returning `0.5` without explanation can make code brittle if the problem statement changes. |

## 📚 The Math Behind It

Let `P(n)` be the probability the `n`‑th passenger sits in his own seat.

* If the first passenger takes seat `1`, all following passengers get their own seats → probability `1/(n)`.
* If the first passenger takes seat `n`, the last passenger is doomed → probability `1/(n)`.
* For any other seat `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ n‑1), the process “restarts” with `n‑k+1` passengers left.

This gives the recurrence

```
P(n) = 1/n * 1 + 1/n * 0 + (n-2)/n * P(n-1)
```

Solving the recurrence shows that for all `n ≥ 2`, `P(n) = 0.5`.  
That’s the elegant proof many interviewers love to hear.

## ✅ Implementations

Below are ready‑to‑compile / run snippets in **Java, Python, and C++**.  
Feel free to copy‑paste into your IDE or coding platform.

### 1. Java

```java
// Java 17
public class Solution {
    public double nthPersonGetsNthSeat(int n) {
        // O(1) solution – a single line of logic
        return n == 1 ? 1.0 : 0.5;
    }
}
```

#### Why it compiles?

* The ternary operator (`? :`) ensures we return a `double`.
* No loops or recursion, so no stack overhead.

---

### 2. Python

```python
# Python 3.10
class Solution:
    def nthPersonGetsNthSeat(self, n: int) -> float:
        return 1.0 if n == 1 else 0.5
```

* Python’s `float` is a 64‑bit IEEE‑754 number – perfect for `0.5`.
* The expression is as concise as the Java version.

---

### 3. C++

```cpp
// C++17
class Solution {
public:
    double nthPersonGetsNthSeat(int n) {
        return n == 1 ? 1.0 : 0.5;
    }
};
```

* Use a ternary operator; `1.0` is a double literal.
* No `using namespace std;` – keeps the snippet clean for contests.

## 🚀 Performance Profile

| Language | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|-------|
| Java     | `O(1)`          | `O(1)`           | 0.1 µs per call |
| Python   | `O(1)`          | `O(1)`           | 1 µs per call (CPython) |
| C++      | `O(1)`          | `O(1)`           | ~0.1 µs per call (GCC) |

All solutions are *constant time* and *constant memory* – ideal for interviews where you’re judged on clean, efficient code.

## 📊 How to Test

```python
def test():
    sol = Solution()
    assert abs(sol.nthPersonGetsNthSeat(1) - 1.0) < 1e-9
    assert abs(sol.nthPersonGetsNthSeat(2) - 0.5) < 1e-9
    assert abs(sol.nthPersonGetsNthSeat(1000) - 0.5) < 1e-9
    print("All tests passed!")

test()
```

* Test `n=1` (edge case).  
* Test a small `n` (2).  
* Test a large `n` (1000) to confirm O(1) performance.

## 🔍 Interview‑Ready Tips

1. **Explain the reasoning** – Interviewers love to see you *know* why `0.5` works.
2. **Show the math briefly** – You can sketch the recurrence or symmetry argument.
3. **Mention edge cases** – `n == 1` is the only case that differs from `0.5`.
4. **Talk about alternatives** – Mention DP or simulation (inefficient), and contrast with the O(1) solution.
5. **Code quality** – Keep the function clean, with proper type hints and comments.
