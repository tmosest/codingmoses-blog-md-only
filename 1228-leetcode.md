        ## 1.‚ÄØProblem Recap

**LeetCode 1228 ‚Äì Missing Number In Arithmetic Progression**

> In an array that originally formed an arithmetic progression (AP) one element (never the first or last) was removed.  
> Given the shortened array `arr`, return the missing value.

**Constraints**

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| `3 ‚â§ arr.length ‚â§ 1000` | ‚úÖ |
| `0 ‚â§ arr[i] ‚â§ 10‚Åµ` | ‚úÖ |
| Array is guaranteed to be valid | ‚úÖ |

**Examples**

| Input | Output | Explanation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `[5,7,11,13]` | `9` | Original AP: `[5,7,9,11,13]` |
| `[15,13,12]` | `14` | Original AP: `[15,14,13,12]` |

## 2.‚ÄØSolution Overview

*An arithmetic progression of length `N+1` has a constant common difference `d`.  
With one element removed, the remaining length is `N`. The correct difference can be derived as*  

\[
d = \frac{arr[N-1] - arr[0]}{N}
\]

*We then scan once for the first index where the difference deviates from `d`. The missing number is `arr[i] + d`.*

### Key Observations

1. **Only one gap is wrong** ‚Äì all other adjacent differences equal `d`.  
2. **Missing number is not first/last**, so the wrong gap will always be found in the scan.  
3. `d` can be negative (decreasing AP) ‚Äì integer division works because `(arr[N-1] - arr[0])` is always divisible by `N` for a valid input.

### Complexity

| Metric | Java / Python / C++ |
|--------|---------------------|
| Time   | **O(N)**            |
| Space  | **O(1)**            |

## 3.‚ÄØCode Implementations

Below are clean, self‚Äëcontained implementations in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.

---

### 3.1 Java

```java
// Java 17
public class Solution {
    public int missingNumberInArithmeticProgression(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int d = (arr[n - 1] - arr[0]) / n;          // common difference of the original AP

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (arr[i + 1] - arr[i] != d) {         // wrong gap found
                return arr[i] + d;                 // missing number
            }
        }
        // The input guarantees that a missing number exists in the middle,
        // so this line will never be reached.
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input");
    }
}
```

---

### 3.2 Python

```python
# Python 3
class Solution:
    def missingNumberInArithmeticProgression(self, arr: list[int]) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        d = (arr[-1] - arr[0]) // n          # common difference

        for i in range(n - 1):
            if arr[i + 1] - arr[i] != d:
                return arr[i] + d
        raise ValueError("Invalid input")     # should never happen for valid LeetCode cases
```

---

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
// C++17
class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumberInArithmeticProgression(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int d = (arr.back() - arr.front()) / n;  // common difference

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            if (arr[i + 1] - arr[i] != d) {
                return arr[i] + d;              // missing number
            }
        }
        throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid input");
    }
};
```

### Introduction

Every coding interviewer loves a problem that forces you to **think mathematically** and **write clean code**. LeetCode 1228 ‚Äì *Missing Number In Arithmetic Progression* is exactly that. It‚Äôs rated ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù but packs a twist: one element (not the first or last) is removed from an AP.  

In this article, we‚Äôll:

1. Break down the problem in plain English.  
2. Reveal the key observation that turns a ‚Äúguess‚Äëand‚Äëcheck‚Äù approach into a **one‚Äëpass O(N) solution**.  
3. Share production‚Äëready implementations in **Java, Python, and C++**.  
4. Discuss pitfalls (‚Äúthe ugly‚Äù), best‚Äëpractice code patterns (‚Äúthe good‚Äù), and common interview traps (‚Äúthe bad‚Äù).  
5. Offer SEO‚Äëfriendly keywords so recruiters searching for ‚ÄúLeetCode 1228 solutions‚Äù see this post.

### 1. Problem Statement (Plain Language)

> *You have an array that used to be a perfect arithmetic progression. Someone removed a middle element. Find that missing number.*

**Key facts**

| Fact | Why it matters |
|------|----------------|
| Length is at least 3 | We‚Äôre guaranteed a middle element exists |
| First and last are unchanged | They anchor the original progression |
| Array is valid | We can rely on integer arithmetic, no corrupt data |

---

### 2. The Good: A One‚ÄëLine Insight

The missing element creates **exactly one ‚Äúbad‚Äù gap** between consecutive numbers. Every other gap equals the common difference `d`.

> **Observation:**  
> `d = (arr[last] - arr[first]) / originalLength`  
> Since the original length was `N+1` but we have only `N` elements, `originalLength = N`.

Once we know `d`, we scan once to find the first index `i` where `arr[i+1] - arr[i] != d`.  
The missing number is simply `arr[i] + d`.

This yields a **linear‚Äëtime, constant‚Äëspace** solution ‚Äì perfect for interviews and production.

---

### 3. The Bad: Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Using `arr[i+1] - arr[i]` to infer `d` blindly | Wrong `d` if the missing element is near the start | Compute `d` from *first* and *last* elements and divide by `N` |
| Not handling negative differences | Wrong answer for decreasing AP | Use integer division; works for negative numbers as long as the difference is divisible by `N` |
| Failing to check the *last* index | Runtime error on tiny arrays | Loop until `N-2`; the missing element is never first or last |

---

### 4. The Ugly: Edge Cases that Trip You Up

1. **All numbers equal** ‚Äì AP with `d = 0`. The formula still works; `d` becomes `0`, and the missing number equals any element.
2. **Large values** ‚Äì `arr[last] - arr[first]` can reach `10^5`, still comfortably within 32‚Äëbit int.
3. **Negative `d`** ‚Äì Decreasing sequences (e.g., `[15,13,12]`) produce `d = -1`. Integer division in most languages keeps the sign, so no extra handling needed.

---

### 5. Code Walk‚Äëthrough (Java)

```java
public int missingNumberInArithmeticProgression(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    int d = (arr[n - 1] - arr[0]) / n;          // common difference

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (arr[i + 1] - arr[i] != d) {         // bad gap found
            return arr[i] + d;                 // missing number
        }
    }
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input");
}
```

- **Time**: `O(N)` ‚Äì single pass.  
- **Space**: `O(1)` ‚Äì only a few integers.

The same logic applies to the Python and C++ snippets shown earlier.

---

### 6. Interview‚ÄëFriendly Tips

- **Explain your thought process**: Mention ‚Äúcommon difference‚Äù and ‚Äúonly one bad gap‚Äù before coding.  
- **Ask clarifying questions**: Confirm that the missing element is never first or last.  
- **Write clean code**: Use descriptive variable names (`commonDiff`, `missing`).  
- **Test edge cases**: Include decreasing AP, zero difference, and small arrays.

### 8. FAQ

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What if the array is already a perfect AP? | By definition, one element is removed, so this cannot happen. |
| Does integer division always give the correct `d`? | Yes, because `(last - first)` is guaranteed divisible by `N` in a valid input. |
| Can the missing number be negative? | No. `arr[i]` are in `[0, 10‚Åµ]`. The missing number will also lie in that range. |
| Is this approach optimal? | For the given constraints, yes. It cannot be better than `O(N)` because you must inspect each element. |
