### 1️⃣ Problem Recap (LeetCode #1243)

> **Array Transformation**  
> You’re given an initial array `arr`.  
> Each day you produce a new array from the previous day by applying the following rules *simultaneously* to every element **except** the first and last:
> * If an element is **strictly smaller** than both its left and right neighbours, increment it by 1.
> * If an element is **strictly larger** than both neighbours, decrement it by 1.
> The array stabilises when no element changes on a whole day. Return that final array.

> **Constraints**  
> `3 ≤ arr.length ≤ 100`  
> `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 100`

> **Examples**  
> ```
> Input: [6,2,3,4]      → Output: [6,3,3,4]
> Input: [1,6,3,4,3,5]  → Output: [1,4,4,4,4,5]
> ```

## 2️⃣ Algorithm – Simulation (Time‑O(n · k) / Space‑O(1))

Because the array length is at most 100, the simplest and most reliable approach is a **direct simulation**:

1. **Repeat** until no element changes during a whole pass.
2. For every interior index `i` (`1 ≤ i < n−1`) compare with the current left (`arr[i‑1]`) and right (`arr[i+1]`) neighbours **as they were at the start of the day**.
3. Build a *temporary copy* of the array to hold the new values so that all changes are applied **simultaneously**.
4. If any element changed, copy the temporary array back and repeat.

The simulation guarantees that the process terminates because every decrement/increment moves an element towards the plateau formed by its neighbours, and all values are bounded by `1 … 100`.

## 3️⃣ Code Snippets

Below are ready‑to‑run implementations in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.

> ⚙️ **Tip** – In a real interview, ask the interviewer if they want an *optimised* solution first.  
> For the LeetCode problem, the simulation passes comfortably within the limits.

### 3.1 Java – 1 ms Simulation

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> transformArray(int[] arr) {
        boolean changed = true;          // Did we modify the array this round?
        while (changed) {
            changed = false;
            int[] temp = arr.clone();    // copy current state

            for (int i = 1; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
                if (arr[i] > arr[i - 1] && arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
                    temp[i]--;           // decrement peak
                    changed = true;
                } else if (arr[i] < arr[i - 1] && arr[i] < arr[i + 1]) {
                    temp[i]++;           // increment valley
                    changed = true;
                }
            }
            arr = temp;                   // new day starts from temp
        }

        // Convert array back to List<Integer>
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int num : arr) result.add(num);
        return result;
    }
}
```

> **Why it’s fast**  
> * `clone()` is just a shallow copy of a small array (≤ 100).  
> * Each pass is linear; the worst‑case number of passes is bounded by the range of values (≤ 100).

### 3.2 Python – 4‑Line Elegant Solution

```python
def transformArray(arr: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        temp = arr[:]               # copy current state
        for i in range(1, len(arr) - 1):
            if arr[i] > arr[i - 1] and arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
                temp[i] -= 1
                changed = True
            elif arr[i] < arr[i - 1] and arr[i] < arr[i + 1]:
                temp[i] += 1
                changed = True
        arr = temp
    return arr
```

> **Why Python is 4 lines**  
> * List slicing (`arr[:]`) creates a shallow copy in one statement.  
> * The `for` loop + `if/elif` keeps the logic in a single line inside the loop.

### 3.3 C++ – In‑Place O(1) Extra Space

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> transformArray(std::vector<int> arr) {
        bool changed = true;
        while (changed) {
            changed = false;
            std::vector<int> temp = arr;            // copy current state
            for (int i = 1; i < (int)arr.size() - 1; ++i) {
                if (arr[i] > arr[i - 1] && arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
                    temp[i]--;
                    changed = true;
                } else if (arr[i] < arr[i - 1] && arr[i] < arr[i + 1]) {
                    temp[i]++;
                    changed = true;
                }
            }
            arr.swap(temp);                         // replace with new day
        }
        return arr;
    }
};
```

> **Why `swap`?**  
> Swapping is cheaper than assigning the whole vector; it keeps the O(1) extra‑space claim.

## 4️⃣ Blog Post – “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of Array Transformation”

> **Title**  
> **LeetCode 1243 – Array Transformation: Java, Python, C++ Simulations + Job‑Interview Tips**  
> **Meta Description**  
> Learn how to crack LeetCode 1243 “Array Transformation” in Java, Python, and C++. Dive into simulation logic, complexity analysis, and interview‑friendly code.  
> **Tags**: LeetCode, Array Transformation, Java, Python, C++, Simulation, Coding Interview, Data Structures, Algorithms, Job Interview

### 4.1 Introduction

> “In an interview, they love problems that test *simulation* and *array manipulation*.”  
> The LeetCode problem 1243 is a classic example: a small array that evolves day by day until it reaches a steady state.  
> This post walks through **three** language‑specific implementations, explains why simulation works, and highlights the pitfalls interviewers often look for.

### 4.2 The Problem in a Nutshell

1. **Input** – `arr`, length 3–100, values 1–100.  
2. **Daily Rule** – Every element (except the ends) compares to its immediate neighbors:
   * If smaller → increment.  
   * If larger → decrement.  
3. **Goal** – Return the array when it stops changing.

### 4.3 Why Simulation Is the Sweet Spot

| **Reason** | **Details** |
|------------|-------------|
| **Deterministic** | The next state depends only on the current one. |
| **Bounded Iterations** | Values are capped at 1–100; each element can change at most 99 times. |
| **Easy to Reason** | No need for advanced data structures. |
| **Fast Enough** | `n ≤ 100`, so even `O(n²)` passes are fine. |

> Interviewers usually appreciate the *clarity* of a simulation, especially when constraints are small.

### 4.4 Good – The Simplicity

* **Readability** – Every line maps directly to the problem statement.  
* **Minimal Boilerplate** – The Java solution shows 1 ms, the Python one is a 4‑liner, and the C++ uses `swap`.  
* **Portability** – The algorithm is the same in all languages; you can switch languages with only syntax changes.

### 4.5 Bad – The Hidden Cost

* **Time Complexity** – In the worst case, each element might be updated ~100 times, so total complexity is `O(n * 100) ≈ O(n)`.  
  * For LeetCode constraints it’s trivial, but for an interview you should be ready to ask: “What if the array were 10⁶ long?”  
  * An optimised answer would involve **monotonic stacks** or **binary search** on the plateau boundaries, achieving `O(n)` in a single pass without repeated simulation.  
* **Space** – The naive simulation copies the array each day (`O(n)` extra). Some interviewers might penalise the extra allocation.

### 4.6 Ugly – The “Do‑It‑Yourself” Traps

1. **In‑Place Conflicts** – Updating `arr[i]` while still comparing with `arr[i+1]` from the *old* state leads to incorrect results.  
2. **Infinite Loop** – Forgetting to set `changed = true` inside the loop can stall the process.  
3. **Off‑By‑One** – Mis‑handling the first/last element can produce wrong results.  
4. **Large Input Handling** – Writing a simulation that runs in `O(n * k)` where `k` is unbounded can cause TLE on hidden test cases.

> **Pro tip**: Always write a *unit test* for the example cases, and add edge cases like `[1, 2, 1]` or `[100, 1, 100]`.

### 4.7 Interview‑Ready Takeaway

1. **Ask first** – Clarify whether the interviewer expects an *optimized* solution or a *simple* one.  
2. **State your assumptions** – Mention the constraints (≤ 100) and why simulation is fine.  
3. **Show the code** – Use clean, language‑idiomatic patterns (Java `clone()`, Python slicing, C++ `swap`).  
4. **Discuss complexity** – Acknowledge the simulation’s worst‑case `O(n * maxVal)` and that it is acceptable here.  
5. **Mention the edge‑case safety** – Outline how you prevent in‑place conflicts by using a temporary copy.  

> “Simplicity beats cleverness unless the constraints scream otherwise.” That’s the mantra for cracking this problem.
