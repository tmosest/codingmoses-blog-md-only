        # Leetcode 1256 – Encode Number  
**Problem recap**

> Given a non‑negative integer `num` (0 ≤ num ≤ 10⁹), return its “encoding string”.  
> The encoding is defined by a **secret function** that can be discovered from a small lookup table (the table was omitted from the statement, but the examples give it away).

**Examples**

| `num` | encoded string |
|-------|----------------|
| 23    | `"1000"` |
| 107   | `"101100"` |

From the two examples we can deduce that the encoding is:
> **Take `num + 1`, write it in binary, then drop the most‑significant bit.**

> e.g.  
> `23 + 1 = 24 = 11000₂` → drop the first `1` → `"1000"`  
> `107 + 1 = 108 = 1101100₂` → drop the first `1` → `"101100"`

The edge case `num = 0` produces the binary string `"1"` after adding one; dropping the leading `1` leaves an empty string, which is the expected result.

## 1.  Algorithm

1. **Increment** `num` → `n = num + 1`.
2. **Convert** `n` to its binary representation (`Integer.toBinaryString` in Java, `bin(n)[2:]` in Python, or a simple bit‑shift loop in C++).
3. **Return** the substring that excludes the first character (the leading `1`).

The algorithm is *O(log num)* in time and *O(log num)* in space (the size of the binary string).

---

## 2.  Code

### Java (O(1) space with a StringBuilder)

```java
class Solution {
    public String encode(int num) {
        // Step 1: increment
        int n = num + 1;
        // Step 2: binary string
        String binary = Integer.toBinaryString(n);
        // Step 3: drop leading '1'
        return binary.substring(1);      // if num == 0 -> returns ""
    }
}
```

### Python (Python 3)

```python
class Solution:
    def encode(self, num: int) -> str:
        n = num + 1
        return bin(n)[3:]  # bin() returns '0b...' -> skip '0b' and the first '1'
```

### C++ (C++17)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string encode(int num) {
        int n = num + 1;
        string bits;
        // Build binary representation from the least significant bit
        while (n) {
            bits.push_back((n & 1) ? '1' : '0');
            n >>= 1;
        }
        reverse(bits.begin(), bits.end());   // most significant bit first
        // Drop the first character
        return bits.substr(1);
    }
};
```

---

## 3.  Testing the solution

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution s = new Solution();
    System.out.println(s.encode(23));   // "1000"
    System.out.println(s.encode(107));  // "101100"
    System.out.println(s.encode(0));    // ""
}
```

The same tests can be run in Python or C++.

## 4.  Time & Space Complexity

| | Java | Python | C++ |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Time** | O(log num) | O(log num) | O(log num) |
| **Space** | O(log num) | O(log num) | O(log num) |

The logarithm comes from the number of bits needed to represent `num + 1`.

### Title  
**Encode Number (Leetcode 1256) – Decode the Secret, Master the Interview, Land Your Dream Job**

### Meta description  
Learn how to crack Leetcode 1256 – Encode Number. Read the Java, Python, and C++ solutions, understand the algorithm, and get interview‑ready. Keywords: encode number, leetcode 1256, coding interview, Java solution, Python solution, C++ solution, binary encoding, algorithm interview.

### Headings & Content

#### 1. Introduction  
- Short intro to Leetcode 1256 – Encode Number.  
- Why it’s a *“medium”* interview problem that tests both bit‑wise thinking and pattern recognition.

#### 2. The Good – What Makes This Problem A Gold‑Mine  
- **Clear input constraints** (0 ≤ num ≤ 10⁹).  
- **Elegant solution** – just a one‑liner with `num + 1` and dropping the MSB.  
- **Scalable** – runs in logarithmic time regardless of input size.  
- **Perfect for interview** – shows mastery over binary representations.

#### 3. The Bad – Common Pitfalls  
- Forgetting to add 1 before converting to binary.  
- Returning the full binary string instead of trimming the leading 1.  
- Mishandling the edge case `num = 0` (should return an empty string).  
- Using costly string operations (e.g., repeatedly appending bits in the wrong order).

#### 4. The Ugly – When Things Go Wrong  
- Misunderstanding the “secret function” and trying to guess a complex mapping.  
- Implementing a full base‑conversion routine when a simple shift will do.  
- Over‑optimising for space and ending up with buggy logic.  
- Not testing with small numbers (1, 2, 3) where the pattern might be hidden.

#### 5. Step‑by‑Step Solution  
- Walk through the logic with examples.  
- Provide the Java, Python, and C++ code blocks.  
- Show a quick unit‑test to verify correctness.

#### 6. Interview Tips  
- Ask clarifying questions: “Can you give me a small table of values?”  
- Explain the “secret function” hypothesis early to demonstrate pattern‑recognition.  
- Show how the solution runs in O(log n) time and O(log n) space.  
- Mention that the algorithm is *O(1)* in terms of extra memory if you reuse the string buffer.

#### 7. SEO‑Optimized Closing  
- Encourage readers to try the problem on Leetcode.  
- Invite them to share their own “one‑liner” solutions.  
- Provide a call‑to‑action: “Join our interview prep newsletter” or “Check out my GitHub for more interview solutions”.

### Keyword Strategy  
- Primary: “Encode Number Leetcode 1256”, “Java solution”, “Python solution”, “C++ solution”.  
- Secondary: “binary encoding interview”, “coding interview questions”, “leetcode medium problems”, “algorithm interview”.

### Why This Blog Helps You Get Hired  
- Demonstrates deep understanding of a well‑known Leetcode problem.  
- Shows ability to translate a cryptic prompt into a clean, efficient algorithm.  
- Uses multiple programming languages to appeal to diverse interviewers.
