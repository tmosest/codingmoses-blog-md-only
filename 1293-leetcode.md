        # üß≠ Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination (LeetCode‚ÄØ1293)

> **Problem type:** Hard ‚Äì BFS + State Tracking  
> **Tags:** *Breadth‚ÄëFirst Search*, *Matrix*, *DP*, *Sliding Window*, *Path‚ÄëFinding*, *Dynamic Programming*

## 1. Problem Recap

You are given an `m x n` grid (`grid[i][j] ‚àà {0,1}`) where `0` is an empty cell and `1` is an obstacle.  
You can move in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) in one step.  
You start at `(0,0)` and want to reach `(m-1, n-1)`.  

You are allowed to eliminate **at most `k` obstacles**.  
Return the *minimum number of steps* needed to reach the goal, or `-1` if it‚Äôs impossible.

**Constraints**

```
1 ‚â§ m, n ‚â§ 40
0 ‚â§ k ‚â§ m * n
grid[0][0] == grid[m-1][n-1] == 0
```

## 2. Why This Problem is a Good Interview Question

| Good | Bad | Ugly |
|------|-----|------|
| **Good** ‚Äì Demonstrates your ability to reason about **stateful BFS** and **multi‚Äëdimensional visited** structures. | **Bad** ‚Äì Many candidates forget that the same cell can be reached with a different number of remaining eliminations, leading to premature pruning. | **Ugly** ‚Äì A na√Øve DFS + pruning will TLE; a DP without BFS will produce an incorrect answer because the *shortest* path may use more eliminations earlier than a longer but ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù path later. |

---

## 3. High‚ÄëLevel Solution Idea

1. **Breadth‚ÄëFirst Search (BFS)** guarantees the shortest path in an un‚Äëweighted graph.  
2. **State = (x, y, remaining‚Äëk)**.  
   * We need a 3‚ÄëD `visited` array `vis[x][y][rem]` to remember if we‚Äôve already visited cell `(x,y)` with `rem` eliminations left.  
3. Push the starting state `(0,0,k,0)` onto a queue (`steps` starts at `0`).  
4. While the queue is not empty, pop the front state and explore its 4 neighbours:
   * If the neighbour is an obstacle (`grid[nx][ny]==1`) **and** `rem>0`, we can step there after spending one elimination (`rem-1`).
   * If the neighbour is empty, we just step there (`rem` stays the same).  
5. If we reach `(m-1,n-1)` return the number of steps taken.  
6. If the queue empties, return `-1`.

The algorithm runs in **O(m‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØn‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØk)** time and the same order of space for the visited array ‚Äì which is perfectly fine for the given limits (`m,n ‚â§ 40`).

## 4. Corner Cases & Gotchas

| Scenario | Why it matters | Fix |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| `k` is very large (`k >= m+n-2`) | You could walk the Manhattan path ignoring all obstacles. | Early exit: `if (k >= m+n-2) return m+n-2;` |
| The grid is 1√ó1 | Start == end | Return `0` immediately. |
| Large `k` but we use `int[][][] vis = new int[m][n][k+1]` | Memory blow‚Äëup (max 40√ó40√ó1600‚âà2.5M ints ‚Üí ~10‚ÄØMB). | Acceptable, but be mindful if you push to >200‚ÄØk. |
| Forget to check bounds | Index out of bounds during neighbour exploration. | `0 ‚â§ nx < m && 0 ‚â§ ny < n` |
| Re‚Äëvisiting a cell with *more* remaining eliminations is always better | We should **not** prune a state if we reach the same cell with *fewer* eliminations left. | Use a 3‚ÄëD boolean `visited`; no comparison of remaining k is needed. |

## 7. Reference Implementation ‚Äì C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int shortestPath(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
        if (k >= m + n - 2) return m + n - 2;

        vector<vector<vector<bool>>> vis(m,
            vector<vector<bool>>(n, vector<bool>(k + 1, false)));
        queue<tuple<int,int,int>> q;                // x, y, remaining_k

        int steps = 0;
        const int dirs[4][2] = {{1,0},{-1,0},{0,1},{0,-1}};
        while (!q.empty()) {
            for (int sz = q.size(); sz > 0; --sz) {
                auto [x, y, rem] = q.front(); q.pop();
                if (x == m-1 && y == n-1) return steps;

                    if (nx < 0 || nx >= m || ny < 0 || ny >= n) continue;

                    if (nrem < 0) continue;
                    if (!vis[nx][ny][nrem]) {
                        vis[nx][ny][nrem] = true;
                        q.emplace(nx, ny, nrem);
                    }
                }
            }

## 8. Optional Optimisation ‚Äì Dijkstra‚Äëlike Greedy

If you‚Äôre looking for a *micro‚Äëperformance tweak*, notice that we *only* need to know the **minimum remaining‚Äëk** for each `(x,y)`.  
A small 2‚ÄëD DP can store the *minimum obstacle count* seen so far on a path to `(x,y)`.  
If that value ‚â§‚ÄØ`k` at the end, the Manhattan distance is the answer.  
However, this approach still requires BFS because the shortest path might not minimise the obstacle count.  
So keep the 3‚ÄëD BFS; it‚Äôs already optimal.

## 8. Summary

| Aspect | Java | Python | C++ |
|--------|------|--------|-----|
| **Time** | O(m‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØn‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØk) | O(m‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØn‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØk) | O(m‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØn‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØk) |
| **Space** | O(m‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØn‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØk) (bool visited) | O(m‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØn‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØk) | O(m‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØn‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØk) |
| **Key idea** | BFS + 3‚ÄëD visited | BFS + 3‚ÄëD visited | BFS + 3‚ÄëD visited |
| **Typical pitfall** | Forget that the same cell can be visited with different remaining `k`. | Same | Same |

---

## 8. How to Use This Solution for a Job Interview

1. **Start with the early‚Äëexit** (`k >= m+n-2`).  
2. Explain that **state** is `tuple(x, y, remaining_k)` and that the queue is level‚Äëby‚Äëlevel.  
3. Emphasise that the **visited** array is 3‚ÄëD *and* **boolean** ‚Äì no extra comparison is required.  
4. Mention the time/space trade‚Äëoffs and why the algorithm is still ‚ÄúHard‚Äù even though the code is only ~30 lines.  
5. Bonus: show a quick ‚Äúwhy not DFS‚Äù reasoning.  

> **Tip:** Interviewers love concise code. Keep the queue `int[]` (Java), `tuple` (C++), or `tuple`/`deque` (Python) to avoid heavy object overhead.

## 9. Final Takeaway

The ‚ÄúShortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination‚Äù problem is the perfect blend of classic BFS and stateful DP.  
Mastering it demonstrates:

* A clear grasp of graph traversal principles.  
* Comfort with multi‚Äëdimensional dynamic programming structures.  
* Awareness of common pitfalls that lead to TLE or WA.  

And **most importantly** ‚Äì it‚Äôs a *show‚Äëoff* question for your next technical interview!

## üéØ 1‚ÄëMinute Summary

> *Use a BFS where each queue entry is `(x, y, remaining‚Äëk)`. A 3‚ÄëD `visited` array guarantees that you won‚Äôt prune a better state. The algorithm runs in `O(m‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØn‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØk)` time and the same space ‚Äì easily within the limits for `m, n ‚â§ 40`.*

Good luck on your next interview, and feel free to drop a comment if you‚Äôd like a deeper dive into the math behind state‚Äëful BFS! üöÄ
