# The LeetCode!

The old nemesis of most developers or at least people hoping to get good job that impresses parents and grandparents.

Just gotta show your FAANGS!!! Facebook, Apple blah blah blah...

Anyway... I have a LeetCode repo where I have solved many of these problems over the years.

The questions can be really fun but they can also be really annoying and well I have grown lazy in my old age...
... shhhh .... you look good for 153... :)

So let's automate a dialy LeetCode Streak... 
That way I can also pretend to have solved over a thousand problems!
Get good job again!!!

Well I probably have solved that many easy ones but still might as well so I don't forget to do them...

## Apple Script

There are other ways to automate things but I have over a decade of experience with this bad boy and it works well for a lot of things.
