        # üìù **Sum of Mutated Array Closest to Target ‚Äì LeetCode 1300**  
**A Complete Guide for Interview‚ÄëReady Developers**  

> **TL;DR** ‚Äì Use a binary‚Äësearch on the ‚Äúcapped‚Äù value, compute the mutated sum in *O(log‚ÄØmax‚ÄØ+‚ÄØlog‚ÄØn)*, and pick the value that gives the smallest absolute difference to the target (ties ‚Üí the smaller value).

## üöÄ Why This Problem Matters

LeetCode 1300 is a **Medium‚Äëlevel** interview question that appears frequently in **software‚Äëengineering interviews** at companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and many fintech startups.  
It tests:

| Skill | Why it‚Äôs important |
|-------|--------------------|
| **Sorting & Prefix Sums** | Efficiently handles large arrays (n‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ10‚Å¥). |
| **Binary Search** | Classic divide‚Äëand‚Äëconquer, an interview staple. |
| **Edge‚ÄëCase Handling** | Proper tie‚Äëbreaking, overflow avoidance. |
| **Time/Space Complexity** | O(n‚ÄØlog‚ÄØn) time, O(n) space ‚Äì a tight fit for interview standards. |

If you can explain this solution clearly, you‚Äôll impress hiring managers looking for solid algorithmic thinking.

## üìå Problem Statement

> **Given** an integer array `arr` and a target `target`, find an integer `value` such that:
> 1. Every element in `arr` greater than `value` is replaced by `value`.
> 2. The sum of the mutated array is as close as possible to `target` (minimum |sum‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØtarget|).
> 3. If two values give the same distance to `target`, return the smaller one.

**Constraints**

```
1 ‚â§ arr.length ‚â§ 10‚Å¥
1 ‚â§ arr[i], target ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
```

## üß† Strategy Overview

1. **Sort `arr`** ‚Äì so that we can know which elements will be capped for a given `value`.
2. **Prefix sums** ‚Äì to compute the sum of the smallest elements quickly.
3. **Binary search on the capped value (`value`)** ‚Äì search space is `[0, max(arr)]`.
4. After the search, evaluate the two adjacent candidate values (`low` and `high`) and pick the one that gives the smaller absolute difference to `target`.  
   *If the differences are equal, pick the smaller value.*

Why binary search?  
For any candidate `value`, the mutated sum is a **monotonically increasing** function of `value`.  
Thus, we can perform a classic binary search on `value` itself, not on the array indices.

---

## üìã Detailed Algorithm

1. **Sort** the array: `arr.sort()`.
2. **Build prefix sum array** `pref[i] = sum(arr[0 ‚Ä¶ i-1])`.
3. Let `maxVal = arr[n-1]`.
4. Binary search on `x` in `[0, maxVal]`:
   * Find `idx` = first index where `arr[idx] > x` (using `bisect_left`).
   * Mutated sum = `pref[idx] + (n - idx) * x`.
   * If sum < target ‚Üí move `low` to `x` (need bigger value).
   * Else ‚Üí move `high` to `x`.
   * Stop when `high - low == 1` (two consecutive candidates).
5. Compute sums for both `low` and `high`; choose the one with minimal |sum‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØtarget| (ties ‚Üí smaller value).

**Complexities**

- Sorting: **O(n‚ÄØlog‚ÄØn)**
- Binary search: **O(log‚ÄØmaxVal)** (‚â§‚ÄØ17 steps because `maxVal` ‚â§‚ÄØ10‚Åµ)
- Each iteration uses **O(log‚ÄØn)** for binary‚Äësearch in the array (`idx`), but we can avoid that by keeping the array sorted and using a two‚Äëpointer sweep if we want O(log‚ÄØmaxVal + log‚ÄØn).  
  In practice, the constant factors are tiny and the solution passes comfortably.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Implementations

Below are clean, interview‚Äëready solutions in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
All three follow the same logic and use 64‚Äëbit integers (`long` / `int64_t`) to avoid overflow.

### Java (LeetCode‚Äëcompatible)

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int findBestValue(int[] arr, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int n = arr.length;
        long[] prefix = new long[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + arr[i];
        }

        int low = 0;
        int high = arr[n - 1];

        // Binary search on the capped value
        while (low + 1 < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            long sum = mutatedSum(prefix, arr, mid);
            if (sum < target) {
                low = mid;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }

        // Evaluate the two candidates
        long lowSum = mutatedSum(prefix, arr, low);
        long highSum = mutatedSum(prefix, arr, high);

        if (Math.abs(lowSum - target) <= Math.abs(highSum - target)) {
            return low;
        } else {
            return high;
        }
    }

    // Helper: compute mutated sum when all elements > x are replaced by x
    private long mutatedSum(long[] prefix, int[] arr, int x) {
        int idx = binarySearchFirstGreater(arr, x); // O(log n)
        long sum = prefix[idx] + (long) (arr.length - idx) * x;
        return sum;
    }

    // Find first index i where arr[i] > x
    private int binarySearchFirstGreater(int[] arr, int x) {
        int l = 0, r = arr.length; // exclusive upper bound
        while (l < r) {
            int m = (l + r) >>> 1;
            if (arr[m] <= x) {
                l = m + 1;
            } else {
                r = m;
            }
        }
        return l;
    }
}
```

### Python (LeetCode‚Äëcompatible)

```python
class Solution:
    def findBestValue(self, arr: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        arr.sort()
        n = len(arr)
        pref = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            pref[i + 1] = pref[i] + arr[i]

        low, high = 0, arr[-1]

        while low + 1 < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if self._mutated_sum(pref, arr, mid) < target:
                low = mid
            else:
                high = mid

        low_sum = self._mutated_sum(pref, arr, low)
        high_sum = self._mutated_sum(pref, arr, high)

        return low if abs(low_sum - target) <= abs(high_sum - target) else high

    @staticmethod
    def _mutated_sum(pref: List[int], arr: List[int], x: int) -> int:
        idx = bisect.bisect_right(arr, x)  # first index with arr[idx] > x
        return pref[idx] + (len(arr) - idx) * x
```

*(Don‚Äôt forget to `import bisect` at the top.)*

class Solution {
public:
    int findBestValue(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int n = arr.size();

        vector<long long> pref(n + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            pref[i + 1] = pref[i] + arr[i];

        int low = 0, high = arr.back();

        while (low + 1 < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            long long sum = mutatedSum(pref, arr, mid);
            if (sum < target)
                low = mid;
            else

        }

        long long lowSum = mutatedSum(pref, arr, low);
        long long highSum = mutatedSum(pref, arr, high);

        if (abs(lowSum - target) <= abs(highSum - target))
            return low;
        else
            return high;
    }

private:
    long long mutatedSum(const vector<long long>& pref,
                         const vector<int>& arr,
                         int x) {
        int idx = upper_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), x) - arr.begin();
        return pref[idx] + 1LL * (arr.size() - idx) * x;
    }
};
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls & Fixes

| Mistake | Why it fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Using `int` for sum calculations | `arr[i] * n` can overflow 32‚Äëbit | Use `long` / `long long` |
| Binary searching on the wrong boundary (`[1, max]`) | Might miss 0 as a valid answer when `target` is very small | Start with `low = 0` |
| Not handling ties properly | Returns the larger value | Compare with `<=` to prefer the smaller one |
| O(n¬≤) approach (cap all elements each iteration) | Too slow for n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ10‚Å¥ | Use prefix sums & binary search |
| Forgetting to sort | `upper_bound` / `bisect_left` misbehave | Always sort first |

## üéØ How to Explain This in an Interview

1. **State the problem** in your own words.  
2. **Sketch the mutated sum function** ‚Äì show it‚Äôs monotonic.  
3. **Explain why binary searching on `value` is valid** ‚Äì monotonic property.  
4. **Walk through the code** ‚Äì highlight the prefix‚Äësum helper and the two‚Äëcandidate final decision.  
5. **Discuss complexity** and why it satisfies interview constraints.  

Use a simple example on a whiteboard (e.g., `arr = [1,2,5]`, `target = 10`) to demonstrate the step‚Äëby‚Äëstep search.

## üéâ Takeaway

- **Key insight**: Mutated sum is a monotonic function of the capped value.  
- **Core tools**: Sorting, prefix sums, binary search.  
- **Edge handling**: Use 64‚Äëbit integers; tie‚Äëbreak by smaller value.

Master this pattern, and you‚Äôll have a strong, reusable tool for any interview that asks you to ‚Äúcap‚Äù values or work with a ‚Äúsaturated‚Äù sum.

Good luck, and happy coding! üöÄ

### FAQs

- **Can I use a linear scan instead of binary search?**  
  Yes, but it becomes *O(n‚ÄØlog‚ÄØn + n)* and may TLE for the worst‚Äëcase (10‚Å¥ elements). Binary search keeps it optimal.

- **Is there a O(n) solution?**  
  With a quick‚Äëselect to find the median or by using bucket counting for the limited value range, you can get *O(n + maxVal)*, but the binary‚Äësearch solution is simpler and cleaner for interviews.

- **Can I skip sorting?**  
  Without sorting you can‚Äôt identify which elements will be capped efficiently, leading to *O(n¬≤)* in the worst case. So sorting is essential.
