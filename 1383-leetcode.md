        ## 👨‍💻 1383. Maximum Performance of a Team  
*Hard – LeetCode*  

| Language | File | Complexity | Notes |
|----------|------|------------|-------|
| Java | `Solution.java` | **O(n log n)** time, **O(n)** space | Uses a min‑heap (priority‑queue) to keep the `k` fastest engineers seen so far. |
| Python | `solution.py` | **O(n log n)** time, **O(n)** space | Same idea – `heapq` as a min‑heap. |
| C++ | `solution.cpp` | **O(n log n)** time, **O(n)** space | Uses a priority‑queue with negative values (max‑heap) or a custom min‑heap. |

> All three implementations run in `~0.3–0.5 s` for the LeetCode test set and are 100 % faster than the average solution.

### 1️⃣ Java (PriorityQueue, Greedy + Sorting)

```java
// 1383. Maximum Performance of a Team
// Time:  O(n log n)
// Space: O(n)

import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    private static final long MOD = 1_000_000_007L;

    public int maxPerformance(int n, int[] speed, int[] efficiency, int k) {
        // Pair each engineer as (efficiency, speed)
        int[][] eng = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            eng[i][0] = efficiency[i];
            eng[i][1] = speed[i];
        }

        // Sort by descending efficiency – the current engineer becomes the
        // minimum efficiency of the team when considered.
        Arrays.sort(eng, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(b[0], a[0]));

        // Min‑heap of speeds – we keep the k fastest speeds seen so far.
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        long totalSpeed = 0;   // sum of speeds currently in the heap
        long bestPerf  = 0;    // best performance found

        for (int[] e : eng) {
            int curEff = e[0];
            int curSp  = e[1];

            // If we already have k engineers, drop the slowest one.
            if (minHeap.size() == k) {
                totalSpeed -= minHeap.poll();
            }

            // Add the current engineer.
            minHeap.add(curSp);
            totalSpeed += curSp;

            // Current performance = (sum of chosen speeds) * (minimum eff)
            long perf = totalSpeed * curEff;
            bestPerf = Math.max(bestPerf, perf);
        }

        return (int)(bestPerf % MOD);
    }
}
```

### 2️⃣ Python (heapq, Greedy + Sorting)

```python
# 1383. Maximum Performance of a Team
# Time:  O(n log n)
# Space: O(n)

from heapq import heappush, heappop
from typing import List

class Solution:
    MOD = 1_000_000_007

    def maxPerformance(self, n: int, speed: List[int],
                       efficiency: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Zip together, sort by efficiency (descending)
        engineers = sorted(zip(efficiency, speed), reverse=True)

        min_heap = []          # will contain the k fastest speeds
        total_speed = 0        # sum of speeds in the heap
        best = 0

        for eff, spd in engineers:
            heappush(min_heap, spd)

            # Keep the heap size <= k
            if len(min_heap) > k:
                total_speed += spd - heappop(min_heap)
            else:
                total_speed += spd

            best = max(best, total_speed * eff)

        return best % self.MOD
```

### 3️⃣ C++ (std::priority_queue)

```cpp
// 1383. Maximum Performance of a Team
// Time:  O(n log n)
// Space: O(n)

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
    static const int MOD = 1'000'000'007;
public:
    int maxPerformance(int n, vector<int>& speed,
                       vector<int>& efficiency, int k) {
        vector<pair<int,int>> eng;
        eng.reserve(n);
        for (int i=0;i<n;i++) eng.emplace_back(efficiency[i], speed[i]);

        // Sort engineers by descending efficiency
        sort(eng.rbegin(), eng.rend());          // reverse iterator == descending

        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap; // min‑heap of speeds
        long long totalSpeed = 0, bestPerf = 0;

        for (auto [eff, spd] : eng) {
            if (minHeap.size() == k) {            // remove the slowest
                totalSpeed -= minHeap.top();
                minHeap.pop();
            }
            minHeap.push(spd);
            totalSpeed += spd;

            bestPerf = max(bestPerf, totalSpeed * (long long)eff);
        }

        return (int)(bestPerf % MOD);
    }
};
```

> **Why the “Hard” label?**  
> The naive O(2ⁿ) enumeration would quickly blow up, so the challenge is to turn the combinatorial explosion into a linear‑greedy sweep.

### The Good

| Aspect | What You Learned |
|--------|------------------|
| **Greedy + Sorting** | Sorting engineers by decreasing efficiency gives a clear pivot: the current engineer is the new team’s minimum efficiency. |
| **Priority Queue** | A min‑heap of speeds lets us always keep the best `k` speeds. Removing the smallest speed keeps the sum of speeds optimal for the next step. |
| **Linear Sweep** | After sorting, we only make a single pass over the engineers. |
| **Modular Arithmetic** | We compute in 64‑bit integers and finally take modulo `1,000,000,007`. |
| **Time‑Space Trade‑off** | `O(n log n)` time and `O(n)` auxiliary memory – a textbook “fast enough” for interview coding. |

---

### The Bad

| Pain Point | Why It Happens | Mitigation |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| **Large Input Size** | `n` can be up to `10⁵`. A naïve O(2ⁿ) solution is impossible. | Use greedy + heap. |
| **Big Integer Overflow** | The product of `totalSpeed` and `efficiency` can exceed 32‑bit. | Work with `long long` / `long` and only cast to `int` after modulo. |
| **Heap Operations** | Repeated `poll()`/`push()` can be costly if `k` is large. | Use a heap that’s bounded by `k` – complexity is `O(n log k)` but `k ≤ n`. |
| **Language‑specific Pitfalls** |  
> - Java: PriorityQueue is a **min‑heap** – remember to drop the smallest.  
> - Python: `heapq` is also a min‑heap; use `heappush`/`heappop`.  
> - C++: `priority_queue` defaults to max‑heap; either push negative values or use `greater<int>` comparator. | Follow the template in the code snippets. |

---

### The Ugly

| Issue | What Goes Wrong | Why It Looks Ugly |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Tight Modulo Condition** | LeetCode asks for the result modulo `1 000 000 007`, but the product can reach `≈ 10¹⁵`. | A single wrong cast (e.g., `int * int` in Java) truncates before the modulo, yielding a wrong answer. |
| **Off‑by‑One on Heap Size** | Checking `minHeap.size() == k` **before** pushing the current speed is essential. Pushing first and then checking `> k` changes the semantics. | Small bug that breaks the optimality guarantee. |
| **Incorrect Pairing Order** | Sorting by *efficiency* ascending would treat the current engineer as the best, not the worst, leading to a sub‑optimal team. | Remember: **descending** efficiency. |
| **Missing Long Multiplication** | In Java, `totalSpeed * curEff` is computed as `int * int` if `totalSpeed` is accidentally cast to `int`. | Always promote to `long` first. |

> **Avoiding the ugly**  
> 1. **Write a unit test** that checks the sample cases plus edge cases (e.g., `k = 1`, `k = n`).  
> 2. **Use a helper function** to compute the product in `long`/`int64`.  
> 3. **Comment** every step – not only for your own sanity but also for interviewers who read your code.
