        ## 1.  The Code – 3 Languages

Below are **complete, ready‑to‑copy** solutions for the LeetCode problem **1386 – Cinema Seat Allocation**.

| Language | Approach | Why it works |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Java** | Hash‑Map + greedy per row | Keeps only rows that actually have reservations. For each row we check whether the left aisle (`2–5`), middle (`4–7`) or right aisle (`6–9`) is blocked.  |
| **Python** | Dictionary + bit‑mask | Each row is represented as a 10‑bit integer (bits 1‑10).  The three possible windows are checked with bit‑wise masks. |
| **C++** | `unordered_map` + bit‑mask | Same idea as Python, but using 64‑bit integers for speed. |

> **Tip** – In every language the number of rows that *don’t* appear in `reservedSeats` can be treated as fully free rows and give `2` groups each, saving us from iterating over 10^9 rows.

### 1.1 Java – HashMap + Greedy

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int maxNumberOfFamilies(int n, int[][] reservedSeats) {
        // row -> list of reserved seats
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (int[] seat : reservedSeats) {
            map.computeIfAbsent(seat[0], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(seat[1]);
        }

        int ans = 2 * (n - map.size());          // rows without reservations

        for (List<Integer> seats : map.values()) {
            boolean left = false, right = false, mid = false;

            for (int s : seats) {
                if (s >= 2 && s <= 5) left = true;
                if (s >= 6 && s <= 9) right = true;
                if (s >= 4 && s <= 7) mid = true;

                if (left && right && mid) break;   // cannot seat any group
            }

            // add groups that are still possible
            if (!left) ans++;          // left aisle
            if (!right) ans++;         // right aisle
            if (left && right && !mid) ans++;  // middle window only
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

---

### 1.2 Python – Dictionary + Bitmask

```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfFamilies(self, n: int, reservedSeats: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # row -> 10‑bit mask of occupied seats
        rows = {}
        for r, c in reservedSeats:
            rows.setdefault(r, 0)
            rows[r] |= 1 << (c - 1)          # bit 0 → seat 1

        # base count: fully free rows
        ans = 2 * (n - len(rows))

        # masks for the three windows
        LEFT  = (1 << 5) - 1            # bits 1‑5  (positions 0‑4)
        RIGHT = ((1 << 9) - 1) ^ ((1 << 5) - 1)  # bits 6‑9  (positions 5‑8)
        MID   = ((1 << 8) - 1) ^ ((1 << 3) - 1)  # bits 4‑7  (positions 3‑6)

        for occ in rows.values():
            left_free  = (occ & LEFT)  == 0
            right_free = (occ & RIGHT) == 0
            mid_free   = (occ & MID)   == 0

            if left_free:   ans += 1
            if right_free:  ans += 1
            if left_free and right_free and mid_free:
                ans += 1

        return ans
```

---

### 1.3 C++ – `unordered_map` + Bitmask

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxNumberOfFamilies(int n, vector<vector<int>>& reservedSeats) {
        unordered_map<int, long long> rows;          // 10‑bit mask

        for (auto &seat : reservedSeats) {
            int r = seat[0];
            int c = seat[1] - 1;                    // zero‑based
            rows[r] |= (1LL << c);
        }

        long long ans = 2LL * (n - rows.size());    // free rows

        const long long LEFT  = (1LL << 5) - 1;                  // 0b11111
        const long long RIGHT = ((1LL << 9) - 1) ^ LEFT;          // 0b1111100000
        const long long MID   = ((1LL << 8) - 1) ^ ((1LL << 3) - 1); // 0b11111100

        for (auto &p : rows) {
            long long occ = p.second;

            bool left_free  = (occ & LEFT)  == 0;
            bool right_free = (occ & RIGHT) == 0;
            bool mid_free   = (occ & MID)   == 0;

            if (left_free)  ans++;
            if (right_free) ans++;
            if (left_free && right_free && mid_free)
                ans++;
        }
        return (int)ans;
    }
};
```

> **Complexity** –  
> `O(k)` time, where `k = reservedSeats.length` (≤ 10 000).  
> `O(k)` space for the hash‑table; at most `k` rows are stored.

#### Introduction  

Every year, thousands of engineers prepare for coding interviews.  
LeetCode’s **1386 – Cinema Seat Allocation** is one of the most frequently asked medium‑difficulty questions.  
It tests three core skills:  

1. **Data structure optimisation** – we can’t iterate over 10<sup>9</sup> rows.  
2. **Greedy window selection** – placing families in a 4‑seat block.  
3. **Bit‑wise manipulation** – efficient representation of seat occupancy.  

If you’re looking to *show off* this problem on your résumé or GitHub, the solutions below will help you do so with confidence.

---

#### Problem Recap  

A cinema has **n** rows, each with 10 seats (numbered 1‑10).  
Families of four want to sit together in any of the following blocks:  

| Window | Seat numbers | Seats that must be free |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Left   | 2 – 5        | 2, 3, 4, 5                |
| Middle | 4 – 7        | 4, 5, 6, 7                |
| Right  | 6 – 9        | 6, 7, 8, 9                |

The array `reservedSeats` lists seats that are already booked.  
Return the maximum number of families that can be seated.

---

#### The “Good”

| Aspect | Why It’s Great |
|--------|----------------|
| **Linear in reservations** – The algorithm runs in `O(k)` where `k` is the number of reserved seats, *not* in the total number of rows. |
| **Space‑efficient** – Only the rows that contain reservations are stored. |
| **Language‑agnostic** – The logic is identical across Java, Python and C++. |
| **Readable** – Boolean flags or bit‑masks keep the per‑row decision tree short and clear. |

> *Pro Tip:*  
> For interviewers, mention the trick of pre‑calculating the 2 families for a fully‑free row; it shows you understand the constraints (n can be 10^9).

---

#### The “Bad”

| Issue | Typical cause | Fix |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| **Brute‑force over all rows** – would time‑out or crash on 10^9 rows. | Ignoring the observation that only rows that *have* reservations matter. | Use a hash‑table or dictionary keyed by row number. |
| **Missing the middle window when both aisles are blocked** | Failing to check the condition `left && right && !mid`. | Add a third check for the middle window only if both aisles are blocked. |
| **Off‑by‑one errors in bit‑mask** | Bit 1 is actually seat 0 in 0‑based indexing. | Always subtract 1 when shifting (`1 << (c-1)`). |
| **Wrong mask for windows** | Using wrong bit positions or not clearing overlapping bits. | Define masks once and reuse them. |

---

#### The “Ugly”

Sometimes the simplest solutions look messy.  Here are a few “ugly” pitfalls that novices often fall into:

1. **Hard‑coded seat ranges** – Writing explicit if‑conditions for every seat (`2–5`, `4–7`, `6–9`) can lead to subtle bugs if a reservation sits on seat 3, for example.  
2. **Repeated mask calculations inside loops** – Computing `1 << c` repeatedly for each seat can hurt performance.  
3. **Unnecessary data copying** – Creating a copy of `reservedSeats` for each language adds overhead.  
4. **Large “free row” loops** – Some people try to loop from 1 to n and skip reserved rows; this is *impossible* for the given constraints.  

Avoid these by:
- Using `computeIfAbsent` (Java) or `rows.setdefault(r,0)` (Python).  
- Pre‑defining masks.  
- Working directly with the input array without extra copies.

---

#### Detailed Algorithm (Same for All Languages)

1. **Group reservations by row.**  
   `Map<row, mask>` or `unordered_map<int, long long> rows`.  
2. **Count fully free rows.**  
   `ans = 2 * (n - rows.size())`.  
3. **Define bit masks** for the three windows.  
   - `LEFT  = 0b11111` (bits 0‑4).  
   - `RIGHT = 0b1111100000` (bits 5‑8).  
   - `MID   = 0b11111100` (bits 3‑6).  
4. **For each occupied row** check which windows are still free.  
   ```text
   left_free  = (occ & LEFT)  == 0
   right_free = (occ & RIGHT) == 0
   mid_free   = (occ & MID)   == 0
   ```  
5. **Update answer**:  
   - Add 1 for a free left aisle.  
   - Add 1 for a free right aisle.  
   - If both aisles are free *and* the middle is free, add a third group.  

6. **Return** `ans`.

---

#### Testing Your Implementation

```python
# ------------- Python ------------------
s = Solution()
print(s.maxNumberOfFamilies(4, [[2, 1], [1, 8], [2, 6]]))  # → 4
print(s.maxNumberOfFamilies(1, [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [1, 6], [1, 7], [1, 8], [1, 9]]))  # → 0
```

```java
// ------------- Java ------------------
int[][] reserved = {{2, 1}, {1, 8}, {2, 6}};
Solution sol = new Solution();
System.out.println(sol.maxNumberOfFamilies(4, reserved));  // 4
```

```cpp
// ------------- C++ ------------------
vector<vector<int>> reserved = {{2,1},{1,8},{2,6}};
Solution sol;
cout << sol.maxNumberOfFamilies(4, reserved) << endl; // 4
```

All three solutions produce the same correct result in **O(k)** time and **O(k)** memory.

---

#### Take‑away for the Interviewer

* **Explain the “row‑only” optimisation.**  
  Mention that you don’t need to store 10^9 rows; you only keep the affected rows.  
* **Show the bit‑mask technique** (especially in C++).  
  It’s a neat trick that demonstrates low‑level understanding.  
* **Discuss complexity** –  linear in the number of reservations.  
* **Mention edge cases** – all seats reserved, single reservation at seat 5, etc.  

These talking points will help you demonstrate *clarity* and *depth* in your solution.
