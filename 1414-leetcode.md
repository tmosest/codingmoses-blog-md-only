        ## 1. Problem Recap – LeetCode 1414

> **Find the Minimum Number of Fibonacci Numbers Whose Sum Is K**  
> Given an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 10⁹), return the smallest number of Fibonacci numbers that sum to `k`.  
> The same Fibonacci number may be used multiple times.

The Fibonacci sequence starts with  
`F₁ = 1`, `F₂ = 1`, `Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂` for `n > 2`.

> Example  
> `k = 7 → 5 + 2  → 2 Fibonacci numbers`  

> **Why is this interesting?**  
> This is a classic *greedy* problem. The optimal strategy is to keep subtracting the largest Fibonacci number that does not exceed the remaining `k`.  
> It is also an excellent interview question because it tests:  
> * number‑theory intuition  
> * greedy algorithms  
> * handling large integers (up to 10⁹)  

Below you’ll find working implementations in **Java, Python, and C++** along with a blog‑style walkthrough of the “good, the bad, and the ugly” aspects of the problem.

## 2. The Three Solutions

### 2.1 Java – 100 % Fast and Memory‑Efficient

```java
// 1414. Find the Minimum Number of Fibonacci Numbers Whose Sum Is K
// Java 17

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public int findMinFibonacciNumbers(int k) {
        // Step 1: generate all Fibonacci numbers <= k
        List<Integer> fibs = new ArrayList<>();
        fibs.add(1); // F1
        fibs.add(1); // F2
        while (true) {
            int sz = fibs.size();
            int next = fibs.get(sz - 1) + fibs.get(sz - 2);
            if (next > k) break;
            fibs.add(next);
        }

        // Step 2: greedy subtraction
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = fibs.size() - 1; i >= 0 && k > 0; i--) {
            while (k >= fibs.get(i)) {
                k -= fibs.get(i);
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    // Simple main for quick manual testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(new Solution().findMinFibonacciNumbers(7));  // 2
        System.out.println(new Solution().findMinFibonacciNumbers(10)); // 2
        System.out.println(new Solution().findMinFibonacciNumbers(19)); // 3
    }
}
```

> **Why it’s good**  
> * `O(F)` time where `F` is the number of Fibonacci numbers ≤ k (≤ 44 for k ≤ 10⁹).  
> * `O(F)` memory – trivial for modern machines.  
> * Iterative – no recursion depth worries.  

> **What to watch out for**  
> * Do **not** use recursion; it may cause stack overflow for large k.  
> * Avoid generating Fibonacci numbers larger than `k` – the loop guard does that.

### 2.2 Python – Concise and Readable

```python
# 1414. Find the Minimum Number of Fibonacci Numbers Whose Sum Is K
# Python 3.11

def findMinFibonacciNumbers(k: int) -> int:
    # generate fibs <= k
    fibs = [1, 1]
    while fibs[-1] + fibs[-2] <= k:
        fibs.append(fibs[-1] + fibs[-2])

    count = 0
    # greedy from largest to smallest
    for f in reversed(fibs):
        while k >= f:
            k -= f
            count += 1
    return count

# quick tests
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(findMinFibonacciNumbers(7))   # 2
    print(findMinFibonacciNumbers(10))  # 2
    print(findMinFibonacciNumbers(19))  # 3
```

> **Why it’s good**  
> * Two‑line loop to build Fibonacci numbers – no magic.  
> * `O(1)` extra memory (list of at most 44 ints).  
> * Intuitive greedy loop with `reversed()` – perfect for interview storytelling.  

> **What to watch out for**  
> * Python’s recursion depth is a danger; never recurse for this problem.  
> * Keep the Fibonacci generator inside the loop guard – it stops at `k`.

### 2.3 C++ – Fast, Modern, and Compiles in 2023

```cpp
// 1414. Find the Minimum Number of Fibonacci Numbers Whose Sum Is K
// C++17 (or later)

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findMinFibonacciNumbers(int k) {
        // Build all Fibonacci numbers <= k
        vector<int> fib{1, 1};
        while (true) {
            int next = fib[fib.size() - 1] + fib[fib.size() - 2];
            if (next > k) break;
            fib.push_back(next);
        }

        // Greedy subtraction
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = (int)fib.size() - 1; i >= 0 && k > 0; --i) {
            while (k >= fib[i]) {
                k -= fib[i];
                ++count;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};

// quick demo
int main() {
    Solution s;
    cout << s.findMinFibonacciNumbers(7) << endl;   // 2
    cout << s.findMinFibonacciNumbers(10) << endl;  // 2
    cout << s.findMinFibonacciNumbers(19) << endl;  // 3
}
```

> **Why it’s good**  
> * Uses `vector<int>` – no manual memory management.  
> * `O(F)` time and space, identical to Java & Python.  
> * Compile‑time fast; no recursion.  

> **What to watch out for**  
> * Beware of integer overflow: `int` is fine because Fibonacci numbers ≤ 10⁹ fit in 32‑bit.  
> * Always guard the while‑loop with `k > 0` – prevents an infinite loop if something goes wrong.

## 3. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

### 3.1 The Good – Why This Problem Is a Win‑Win

| ✅ Feature | Why It Matters |
|------------|----------------|
| **Greedy Optimality** | The problem is a textbook example of a *greedy* algorithm that can be proven optimal via Zeckendorf’s theorem. |
| **Small Search Space** | Fibonacci numbers ≤ 10⁹ are only 44 in count, making brute‑force or DP unnecessary. |
| **Interview Appeal** | Demonstrates quick problem decomposition: *generate → greedy → count*. |
| **Language‑agnostic** | All three implementations share the same logic; great for cross‑language interviews. |

### 3.2 The Bad – Common Pitfalls

| ❌ Pitfall | What Happens | Fix |
|------------|--------------|-----|
| **Recursive Solution** | Stack overflow on large `k`. | Use iteration or tail recursion (not needed). |
| **Generating All Fibonacci Numbers** | Slightly wasteful if not limited to `k`. | Stop when the next Fibonacci exceeds `k`. |
| **Ignoring Edge Cases** | `k = 1` → returns `1` but some code returns `0`. | Handle `k <= 1` explicitly. |
| **Time Complexity Misconception** | Believing it’s `O(k)` due to subtraction loop. | Real cost is `O(F * count)`, but `F` ≤ 44 and `count` ≤ 5 (by Zeckendorf). |

### 3.3 The Ugly – Subtle Logical Traps

| ⚠️ Trap | Why It’s Ugly | How to Avoid |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Using `long`/`long long` unnecessarily** | Extra memory and slower operations. | Use `int` (32‑bit) – all Fibonacci numbers fit. |
| **Using `while (k >= fib)` inside the outer loop** | Leads to `O(k)` in the worst case if `fib = 1`. | Since the outer loop already iterates from large to small, a single subtraction per `k` suffices. |
| **Off‑by‑one in Fibonacci generation** | The sequence may start with `[1]` only, missing the second `1`. | Always start with `[1, 1]`. |
| **Assuming greedy works for all integer sums** | True for Fibonacci but not for arbitrary bases. | Keep Zeckendorf’s theorem in mind. |

## 5. Takeaway – How to Nail the Interview

1. **Explain the Greedy Insight** – mention Zeckendorf’s theorem and why the largest‑first approach is optimal.  
2. **Show the Code** – pick the language you’re most comfortable with; the logic is identical across Java, Python, and C++.  
3. **Discuss Complexity** – highlight that it runs in constant time (`O(1)` in practice, since only ~44 Fibonacci numbers).  
4. **Mention Edge Cases** – show you thought about `k = 1` and large values.  
5. **Be Ready to Compare** – discuss why recursion is bad and why the iterative greedy beats DP.

## 6. Final Thoughts

LeetCode 1414 is more than a coding exercise; it’s a showcase of algorithmic elegance. By mastering the greedy strategy, you’ll impress interviewers with:

* *Conciseness* – small, clear loops.  
* *Speed* – O(1) behavior for practical limits.  
* *Robustness* – handles all valid inputs without risk of overflow or recursion limits.
