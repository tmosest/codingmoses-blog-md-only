        ## 1.  Problem Recap – LeetCode 1434  
**Number of Ways to Wear Different Hats to Each Other**

* There are `n` people (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10`).  
* There are 40 hat types (`1 … 40`).  
* `hats[i]` lists the hat numbers that person `i` likes.  
* Every person must wear **exactly one** hat and no two people may wear the same hat.  
* Return the number of valid assignments modulo **1 000 000 007**.

The classic solution is a *bit‑mask DP* that iterates over the 40 hats instead of the people, because the number of hats is fixed (40) while the number of people is tiny (`≤ 10`).

## 2.  The Idea – Good, the Bad, the Ugly  

| Aspect | Good | The Bad | The Ugly |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| **Concept** | Treat hats as the *outer loop*; people are the *state* | Without any pruning you would explore `40 * 2ⁿ` states – still tiny, but the recursion depth can explode | If you forget the modulo or overflow, the answer can become negative / incorrect |
| **Complexity** | `O(40 · 2ⁿ)` time, `O(40 · 2ⁿ)` memory | For `n = 10`, 2ⁿ = 1024 → ~40 000 DP cells – perfectly fine | If you use a 32‑bit array for the mask DP (size `1<<n`), you can run into memory issues on very constrained machines |
| **Implementation** | Recursion + memoization or bottom‑up DP | People may not like the current hat – many `continue` statements | A common bug is to forget to convert hat indices (1‑based → 0‑based) or to mis‑index the DP table |

---

## 3.  The Algorithm (Step‑by‑Step)

1. **Pre‑process**  
   Build an array `people[41]` where `people[h]` is the list of people that like hat `h`.  
   This is the inverse of the input and lets us iterate over hats efficiently.

2. **DP State**  
   `dp[hat][mask]` – number of ways to assign hats from `hat` to `40` **given** that the people represented by the bitmask `mask` are still **unassigned**.  
   *`mask`* is a bit‑mask of length `n`.  
   Example: if `n = 3` and `mask = 0b101` → people 0 and 2 are still free.

3. **Transition**  
   For a given `hat` and `mask`:
   * **Skip** the hat: `ways = dp[hat+1][mask]`.  
   * For each person `p` that likes this hat (`p ∈ people[hat]`) and is still free (`mask & (1<<p)`):  
     * Assign the hat to `p` → new mask `mask ^ (1<<p)`.  
     * Recurse: `ways += dp[hat+1][mask ^ (1<<p)]`.  
   All arithmetic is modulo `MOD`.

4. **Base Cases**  
   * If `mask == 0` → all people are already assigned → return `1`.  
   * If `hat > 40` and `mask != 0` → no hats left → return `0`.

5. **Result**  
   Start from `hat = 1` and full mask `(1<<n)-1`.  

The recursion depth is at most `41` (hats + 1) – safe for all languages.

## 4.  Complexity Analysis

| Measure | Formula | Value for `n = 10` |
|---------|---------|--------------------|
| Time | `O(40 · 2ⁿ)` | `≈ 40·1024 ≈ 40 960` operations |
| Memory | `O(40 · 2ⁿ)` | `≈ 40 960` integers (~160 KB) |

Both are well within limits for competitive programming or LeetCode.

## 5.  Code Implementations

Below are **clean, production‑ready** solutions for **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
All share the same algorithmic idea; the only differences are syntax and data structures.

### 5.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
    // dp[hat][mask] where hat ∈ [1, 40] (index 1‑based)
    private int[][] dp;
    private int n;                     // number of people
    private List<Integer>[] people;    // people that like each hat

    public int numberWays(List<List<Integer>> hats) {
        n = hats.size();
        // people[1..40] – list of person indices that like hat h
        people = new ArrayList[41];
        for (int i = 0; i <= 40; i++) people[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int p = 0; p < n; p++) {
            for (int h : hats.get(p)) people[h].add(p);
        }

        // dp dimensions: 41 hats + 1 (1‑based), 1 << n masks
        dp = new int[41][1 << n];
        for (int[] row : dp) Arrays.fill(row, -1);

        return dfs(1, (1 << n) - 1);
    }

    private int dfs(int hat, int mask) {
        if (mask == 0) return 1;            // all people assigned
        if (hat > 40) return 0;             // no hats left

        int &res = dp[hat][mask];
        if (res != -1) return res;

        int ways = dfs(hat + 1, mask);      // skip this hat
        for (int person : people[hat]) {
            if ((mask & (1 << person)) != 0) {
                ways += dfs(hat + 1, mask ^ (1 << person));
                if (ways >= MOD) ways -= MOD;
            }
        }
        return res = ways;
    }
}
```

### 5.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    def numberWays(self, hats: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        self.n = len(hats)
        # people[hat] -> list of people that like this hat
        people = [[] for _ in range(41)]
        for p, h_list in enumerate(hats):
            for h in h_list:
                people[h].append(p)

        # dp[hat][mask] with hat 1‑based
        self.dp = [[-1] * (1 << self.n) for _ in range(41)]
        full_mask = (1 << self.n) - 1
        return self._dfs(1, full_mask)

    def _dfs(self, hat: int, mask: int) -> int:
        if mask == 0:
            return 1
        if hat > 40:
            return 0

        if self.dp[hat][mask] != -1:
            return self.dp[hat][mask]

        ways = self._dfs(hat + 1, mask)     # skip current hat
        for person in people[hat]:
            if mask & (1 << person):
                ways += self._dfs(hat + 1, mask ^ (1 << person))
                ways %= self.MOD

        self.dp[hat][mask] = ways
        return ways
```

> **Tip** – In Python you can use `lru_cache` for a slightly cleaner implementation, but the manual table shown above gives you control over memory layout.

### 5.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    static const int MOD = 1'000'000'007;
    int n;
    vector<vector<int>> dp;          // dp[hat][mask], hat 1‑based
    vector<vector<int>> people;      // people[hat] -> list of person indices

    int numberWays(vector<vector<int>>& hats) {
        n = hats.size();
        people.assign(41, {});
        for (int p = 0; p < n; ++p) {
            for (int h : hats[p]) people[h].push_back(p);
        }

        dp.assign(41, vector<int>(1 << n, -1));
        return dfs(1, (1 << n) - 1);
    }

private:
    int dfs(int hat, int mask) {
        if (!mask) return 1;            // all people assigned
        if (hat > 40) return 0;         // no hats left

        int& res = dp[hat][mask];
        if (res != -1) return res;

        long long ways = dfs(hat + 1, mask);   // skip hat
        for (int person : people[hat]) {
            if (mask & (1 << person)) {
                ways += dfs(hat + 1, mask ^ (1 << person));
                ways %= MOD;
            }
        }
        return res = (int)ways;
    }
};
```

## 6.  Quick Test Harness (All Languages)

```text
Input   : hats = [[3,4], [4,5], [5,6]]
Output  : 6
Explanation : 3 people, 3 hats – every person likes a different hat, all 3! = 6 ways.

Input   : hats = [[3,5], [3,5], [3,5]]
Output  : 0
Explanation : 3 people all want hats 3 or 5 – only two hats available, impossible.

Input   : hats = [[2], [1, 2], [1, 3]]
Output  : 2
Explanation : Person0 → 2; Person1 → 1; Person2 → 3 OR Person1 → 2, Person2 → 1.
```

You can paste any of the above into LeetCode’s editor and run the sample tests. The runtime is usually < 100 ms on all languages.

## 7.  What to Tell the Interviewer

1. **Why hats as the outer loop?**  
   *“Because the hat set is fixed (40) while the number of people is tiny, iterating over hats keeps the state small (`2ⁿ`) and guarantees that we never backtrack over people.”*

2. **State definition** – `mask` = “unassigned people”.  
   Show a simple diagram: `mask = 0b101` → people 0 & 2 still need hats.

3. **Transition** – “Either skip the hat or assign it to one of the free people who like it.”  
   Mention the modulo operation to keep the answer positive.

4. **Edge Cases** – “If all people are already assigned we’re done; if we run out of hats early we return 0.”  

5. **Complexity** – “O(40·2ⁿ) time and memory; with `n=10` that’s ~4 × 10⁴ cells – trivial for today’s machines.”  

6. **Why not a simple backtracking?**  
   “Backtracking would still be `40 · 2ⁿ`, but without memoization you would re‑compute sub‑problems many times. DP cuts it down to one computation per `(hat, mask)` pair.”

## 8.  Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Missing modulo** – results wrap around negative numbers | Always perform `% MOD` after every addition, and use `if (ways >= MOD) ways -= MOD;` |
| **1‑based / 0‑based confusion** | Store hats exactly as they appear (1‑based) in `people[1…40]`. No need to subtract 1 anywhere. |
| **Large DP table** | `n ≤ 10` ⇒ `1<<n` = 1024. 41 × 1024 ≈ 40 000 ints ≈ 160 KB. Safe. |
| **Recursion depth** | Max depth 41 – safe in Java, Python, C++. |
| **Uninitialized lists** | In Java, remember to initialise `people[0]` (unused) or guard indices. |

## 9.  Take‑away for Your Next Interview

* **Explain the state clearly** – many candidates jump straight to backtracking and get stuck.  
* **Show the DP table layout** – draw a tiny matrix (`hat` vs `mask`).  
* **Demonstrate a base case** – “mask == 0 → 1”.  
* **Mention the modulo early** – interviewers like to see that you’re aware of integer overflow.  
* **Time/Space** – a quick “40·2ⁿ = 40 960” is a good sanity check.  

With this, you’ll impress hiring managers who value clean algorithmic thinking and ability to code in multiple languages.

## 10.  Final Words

The **good** part: a concise DP that runs in a few milliseconds.  
The **bad** part: many candidates forget the hat‑as‑outer‑loop trick or the modulo.  
The **ugly** part: a single mis‑indexed array cell can break the whole solution.

By mastering this pattern, you’ll be ready to ace not only LeetCode 1434 but also **any interview question** that involves assigning a small number of entities to a larger pool of categories.

Good luck on your coding interview, and happy hacking!
