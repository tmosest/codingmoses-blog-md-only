# Clever Girl

Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage!!! But we're going UP! UP! And away!

- [Jurrasic Park: Clever Girl](https://youtu.be/QIzqgm4GusA)

Definelty not... I've seen a house fly and I have seen a horse fly... but I have never seen an elephant fly...

or jump... which means we are back on the data science vision AI topic... psych... 

# Job Searcher

Applying to jobs is now all AI reading AI generated resumes for AI bosses. 

So there I made something without AI to apply for jobs for me!
    - Sorry Jobots you be getting a lot spam lol...
    - And Cyber Coders...

And will probably add AI back into it without using API tokens cause why... OPEN AI you already get good moneys...

But first we will eliminate every easy apply button on every site everywhere until ever recruiter everywhere is forced to know the name of Moses...

Recruiters let my paycheck go!!! There are squirrels and rats to fight! I mean start restuarants with.

Well that took about 30 minutes for LinkedIn to get sick of me.... that's no surprise as I used to do that just about everyday earlier this year without code.

## LinkedIn Rant

LinkedIn seems to be a terrible place to apply to jobs to anyway. It really only seems useful for talking to future coworkers and a little bit of self marketing.

It has become like a Facebook meme of job social media. I heard BlueSky is kinda an alternative but I haven't researched it much.

Anyway... just watch out for scammer and fake accounts on LinkedIn as well. There are fake jobs that send you checks to buy fake equipment to steal your money etc.

## Zip Recruiter Rant

ZipRecruiter is an old tool and it can be better and worse somehow magically at the same time.
It is another site that I have helped automate to help out an ex girlfriend at her role.

Applicants are more likely to see your job posting if it has been recently refreshed.
Jobs with high turnovers need more applicants.
Therefore she was expected to refresh the ads regularly and to also promote that it was a great business on social media.

The job was selling Direct TV to people at places like Costco.
I believe they only got paid for their sales too.
And... at the time... Direct TV was loved in a way that can only be described as the opposite of the Mc Rib...
Seeing a brick spontanesously take off into the air because it was secretly an alien space craft for an evil intergalatic hamster is more likely... (Especially if you are watching Lilo & Stich).

## In Summary

I think the best bet is when someone applies on the actual website.
Really the best is when you know someone.
That is a story for another time.

Anyway, back to the one true reason to live... 

# LeetCode 

In two days we have managed to parrot solve.... drum roll...

`Back Again, LeetCodeCount:280 is back don't tell a friend...`

`280` LeetCode questions... Not bad not bad... 

Therefore, the LeetCode solution crawler is still working well or well enough.
Some bugs were found and fixed in production. Such as...

## Infinite Loop!

The dreaded off by one error... Turns out I had created an infinite loop in trying to add backtracking to the algorithm.

Also AppleScript indexes start at 1... wtf... who.... what... Steve... why????? must have been Mr Jobs right?

The program now checks to make sure that the submitted code got a proper response back. If not it will try code from solutions links instead.

Which is prefect because the editorial also doesn't get the correct solution link sometimes. 

Also, there was a slight bug in the solutions code where if someone had only submitted code in one language we were not getting it.
That was easy to fix.  I am still confused by the JavaScript controller for code selection.
It can be buggy and for someone with a disability they wouldn't be able to read the correct code solution without asking for it twice.

Some minor optimizations were made to the code as well to delete some unneeded page loads.

# OctoPi!

## No Comrade Left Behind...

We still have a fallen soldier Ender 5 at the moment. One has been happily creating new raspberry pi cases, however the other one will not even center x/y.

Found the configuration files I needed in an old repo but didn't have a chance to finish setting up the 2nd Ender 5 today it will be tomorrow.

# Sleep Debt

I got to pay that sleep debt again...

```
To sleep—perchance to dream. Ay, there’s the rub!

- Shakespeare, Hamlet (1602)
```
