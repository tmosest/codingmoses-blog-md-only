        ## 1.  Problem Recap (LeetCode 1510 – Stone Game IV)

> **Alice** and **Bob** play a game.  
> Initially there are **n** stones in a pile.  
> On a turn a player may remove any *positive* perfect‑square number of stones (1, 4, 9, 16 …).  
> If a player cannot make a move, he loses.  
> Alice always starts.  
> **Return** `true` if Alice wins with optimal play, otherwise `false`.

```
1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000
```

The classic game‑theory “win/lose” DP applies.



--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.  Solution Overview

| Strategy | Complexity | How it works |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Top‑down (memoized recursion)** | `O(n√n)` time, `O(n)` space | Recursively compute `dp[x]` = “current player can force a win with `x` stones”.  Memoize results. |
| **Bottom‑up (iterative DP)** | `O(n√n)` time, `O(n)` space | Build `dp[0…n]` from 0 up to `n`.  For each `i` try all squares `j² ≤ i`; if any move leads to a losing state, mark `dp[i] = true`. |
| **Optimised square enumeration** | `O(n√n)` still, but fewer operations | Pre‑compute all squares ≤ `n` once and reuse the list. |

All three variants share the same asymptotic complexity – the dominating factor is iterating over the square numbers for every `i`.  
With `n = 10⁵`, `√n ≈ 316`, so the algorithm runs comfortably in < 0.1 s in Java/Python/C++.

## 3.  Code

> The following snippets compile with standard compilers / runtimes.

### 3.1 Java

```java
// 1510. Stone Game IV – Java (Top‑down + Bottom‑up)
// --------------------------------------------------
// Top‑down (memoized recursion)
class SolutionTopDown {
    private Boolean[] memo; // null = uncomputed

    public boolean winnerSquareGame(int n) {
        if (memo == null) memo = new Boolean[n + 1];
        return solve(n);
    }

    private boolean solve(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return false;          // no move → lose
        if (memo[n] != null) return memo[n];

        for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (!solve(n - i * i)) {       // opponent loses → current wins
                memo[n] = true;
                return true;
            }
        }
        memo[n] = false;                   // all moves lead to opponent win
        return false;
    }
}

// Bottom‑up (iterative DP)
class SolutionBottomUp {
    public boolean winnerSquareGame(int n) {
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[n + 1];   // dp[0] = false by default
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j * j <= i; j++) {
                if (!dp[i - j * j]) {      // move leads to losing state
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Python

```python
# 1510. Stone Game IV – Python
# --------------------------------------------------
# Top‑down memoization
class SolutionTopDown:
    def winnerSquareGame(self, n: int) -> bool:
        from functools import lru_cache

        @lru_cache(None)
        def win(rem: int) -> bool:
            if rem == 0:
                return False
            i = 1
            while i * i <= rem:
                if not win(rem - i * i):
                    return True
                i += 1
            return False

        return win(n)

# Bottom‑up iterative DP
class SolutionBottomUp:
    def winnerSquareGame(self, n: int) -> bool:
        dp = [False] * (n + 1)  # dp[0] = False
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            j = 1
            while j * j <= i:
                if not dp[i - j * j]:
                    dp[i] = True
                    break
                j += 1
        return dp[n]
```

// 1510. Stone Game IV – C++17
// --------------------------------------------------
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Top‑down memoized recursion
class SolutionTopDown {
public:
    bool winnerSquareGame(int n) {
        memo.assign(n + 1, -1);          // -1 = uncomputed
        return solve(n);
    }

private:
    vector<int> memo;                    // 0 = lose, 1 = win

    bool solve(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return false;
        if (memo[n] != -1) return memo[n];
        for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; ++i) {
            if (!solve(n - i * i)) {
                memo[n] = 1;
                return true;
            }
        }
        memo[n] = 0;
        return false;
    }
};

// Bottom‑up iterative DP
class SolutionBottomUp {
public:
    bool winnerSquareGame(int n) {
        vector<bool> dp(n + 1, false);   // dp[0] = false

            }
        }

### 4.1 Title & Meta Description

**Title:**  
`Stone Game IV – LeetCode 1510 Explained: DP, Game Theory & Interview Tips`

**Meta Description:**  
`Master LeetCode 1510 – Stone Game IV. Dive into DP solutions, top‑down vs bottom‑up strategies, game‑theory insights, and interview‑ready code snippets in Java, Python & C++.`

---

### 4.2 Introduction – Why This Question Matters

> The *Stone Game IV* problem is a perfect example of a “simple‑looking” question that hides a deep algorithmic lesson:  
> *How do you decide a win or loss when you can only make moves that are perfect squares?*  
> Solving it demonstrates mastery of *state‑based DP*, *recursion with memoization*, and *game‑theory reasoning*—skills that recruiters love to see.

---

### 4.3 The Good – Why DP is a Natural Fit

1. **Clear win/lose state**  
   - Every pile size `x` is either **winning** (current player can force a win) or **losing** (opponent will win).  
   - This binary property is a hallmark of *Impartial Games* (both players have the same moves).

2. **Recurrence is trivial to derive**  
   ```
   win[x] = ∃k² ≤ x  such that win[x – k²] == false
   ```
   The recurrence follows straight from the definition of optimal play: *make a move that forces the opponent into a losing state.*

3. **Linear construction**  
   - Bottom‑up DP builds `win[0…n]` in one pass, making the algorithm straightforward to debug and test.

4. **Scalable**  
   - With `n = 10⁵` the algorithm runs in a few milliseconds, making it interview‑friendly and demonstrating awareness of time‑space trade‑offs.

### 4.4 The Bad – Pitfalls that Steal Your Time

| Pitfall | How it appears | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| **TLE from unnecessary square generation** | Re‑computing `i*i` inside the inner loop for every `i`. | Pre‑compute the list of squares once (`1, 4, 9 …`) or use a simple `while j*j <= i`. |
| **Stack overflow in recursion** | Deep recursion when `n` is large (e.g., 10⁵). | Use memoization (`@lru_cache` in Python, `Vector<int>` in C++) or switch to iterative DP. |
| **Wrong base case** | Treating `dp[1]` as win by default without checking. | Explicitly set `dp[0] = false`; all other entries start `false`. |
| **Off‑by‑one errors** | Loop bounds `i <= n` vs `i < n`. | Use inclusive loops that mirror the problem statement (`1 … n`). |

---

### 4.5 The Ugly – Sub‑optimal Approaches and How to Avoid Them

1. **Brute‑Force DFS (no memoization)**  
   - Exponential time `O(2^(n/1))`.  
   - Works only for `n < 20`.  
   - **Why it’s ugly:** It forces you to write back‑tracking code that is error‑prone and will get a “Time Limit Exceeded” verdict.

2. **Greedy “Take the largest square”**  
   - Intuition: “Take the biggest chunk.”  
   - **Why it fails:** Counter‑examples exist (e.g., `n = 7`: taking 9 is impossible, taking 4 leaves 3 which is winning for the opponent).  
   - **Takeaway:** Greedy is not a general solution for impartial games.

3. **Ignoring perfect‑square constraint**  
   - Replacing squares with *any* integer leads to a different problem (the classic Nim).  
   - **Lesson:** Always double‑check the constraints; small changes drastically alter the DP recurrence.

---

### 4.6 Step‑by‑Step Walkthrough (Bottom‑up)

```text
dp[0] = false                 // 0 stones → lose

i = 1: try 1²
    dp[1-1] = dp[0] = false → dp[1] = true

i = 2: try 1²
    dp[1] = true → no win found → dp[2] = false

i = 3: try 1²
    dp[2] = false → dp[3] = true

...
```

*Show a small table or diagram in the article to illustrate the evolution of `dp`.*

### 4.7 Interview‑Ready Tips

| Tip | Why it helps |
|-----|--------------|
| **Explain the game‑theory concept** (`win` vs `lose` states) before coding. | Shows depth of understanding and helps interviewers see your reasoning. |
| **Show both approaches** (top‑down + bottom‑up). | Demonstrates flexibility and a deeper grasp of DP paradigms. |
| **Mention the `O(n√n)` bound early**. | Highlights that you considered performance before coding. |
| **Talk about edge cases** (`n` is a perfect square, `n` is 0). | Small bugs often cause wrong‑answer verdicts. |
| **Practice with the “hard” constraints** (`n = 10⁵`). | Confirms that your code will pass the strict limits. |

---

### 4.8 Closing Thoughts

> **Stone Game IV** is a deceptively short question that opens a window onto a broader set of interview skills:  
> *Dynamic programming, recursion, memoization, iterative DP, game‑theory logic, and careful handling of constraints.*  
> Mastering it gives you confidence for any “impartial game” or “optimal‑play” problem you’ll encounter.

Happy coding—and good luck on the interview!
