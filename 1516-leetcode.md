## 1. Problem Recap

You’re given a rooted **N‑ary tree** where every node has a unique value.  
The tree is represented by the `Node` class

```java
public class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> children;
    public Node() { children = new ArrayList<>(); }
    public Node(int _val) { val = _val; children = new ArrayList<>(); }
}
```

and two distinct nodes `p` and `q`.  
**Goal** – move the whole subtree rooted at `p` to become the **last child** of `q`.  
If `p` is already a direct child of `q` nothing changes.  
Three subtle cases need special handling:

| Case | Situation | What to do |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **1** | `q` is inside the subtree of `p` | Detach `q` from its parent, attach `p` to `q`. After the swap the former root (`p`) may no longer be the root – the new root becomes the former `q`. |
| **2** | `p` is inside the subtree of `q` | Just detach `p` from its old parent and attach it to `q` (at the end). |
| **3** | `p` and `q` are in different subtrees (neither contains the other) | Same as case 2. |
| **4** | `p` is already a child of `q` | No change. |

The tree is small (`2 ≤ nodes ≤ 1000`), so a single DFS is more than fast enough.

---

## 2. Core Idea

1. **Build a `parent` map** (`Node → Node`) with a DFS that visits every node once.  
   `parent[root] = null` because the root has no parent.

2. **Identify the four cases** using that map:

   * `pParent = parent[p]`
   * `qParent = parent[q]`
   * `p` is child of `q` ⇔ `pParent == q`
   * `p == root` ⇔ `pParent == null`
   * `q` is descendant of `p` ⇔ walk up from `q` via the parent map until `null` or hit `p`.

3. **Perform the move** – remove `p` from its old parent's children list, then append it to `q`’s children list.

4. **Return the (possibly new) root** – `q` becomes the root if we swapped case 1, otherwise the original root stays.

The algorithm is **O(N)** time and **O(N)** space (the parent map).  
All operations on the children list are `O(1)` on average because we only ever do a single removal/append.

---

## 3. Reference Implementation

Below are clean, commented solutions in **Java, Python and C++** that you can drop into LeetCode.  
All three follow the exact same logic.

---

### 3.1 Java

```java
/**
 * Definition for a Node.
 * public class Node {
 *     public int val;
 *     public List<Node> children;
 *     public Node() { children = new ArrayList<>(); }
 *     public Node(int _val) { val = _val; children = new ArrayList<>(); }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    // Helper map: node -> its parent (root has null)
    private final Map<Node, Node> parent = new HashMap<>();

    public Node moveSubTree(Node root, Node p, Node q) {
        // Build parent pointers
        dfs(root, null);

        // Quick check: nothing to do
        if (parent.get(p) == q) return root;   // p is already child of q

        Node pParent = parent.get(p);
        Node qParent = parent.get(q);

        // Case 2/3: normal move
        if (pParent != null) {
            pParent.children.remove(p);
        }

        // Case 1: q is inside p's subtree
        if (isDescendant(p, q)) {
            // detach q from its parent
            qParent.children.remove(q);
            // attach p under q
            q.children.add(p);
            // new root is q
            return q;
        }

        // Normal case: attach p to q
        q.children.add(p);
        return root;
    }

    /** DFS to fill parent map. */
    private void dfs(Node cur, Node par) {
        if (cur == null) return;
        parent.put(cur, par);
        for (Node ch : cur.children) {
            dfs(ch, cur);
        }
    }

    /** Return true if target is in subtree rooted at root. */
    private boolean isDescendant(Node root, Node target) {
        if (root == target) return true;
        for (Node ch : root.children) {
            if (isDescendant(ch, target)) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Why this works**

- `dfs` gives us constant‑time access to any node’s parent.
- `isDescendant` is a lightweight DFS; the overall complexity stays linear because each node is visited at most once during the whole algorithm (the call from `moveSubTree` is only for one `q`).

### 3.2 Python

```python
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, children=None):
        self.val = val
        self.children = children if children is not None else []

class Solution:
    def moveSubTree(self, root: 'Node', p: 'Node', q: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        # parent map
        parent = {}
        self._dfs(root, None, parent)

        # Quick exit
        if parent[p] == q:
            return root

        p_parent = parent[p]
        q_parent = parent[q]

        # Remove p from old parent
        if p_parent:
            p_parent.children.remove(p)

        # If q inside p's subtree -> case 1
        if self._is_descendant(p, q):
            q_parent.children.remove(q)
            q.children.append(p)
            return q  # new root

        # Normal attach
        q.children.append(p)
        return root

    def _dfs(self, node, par, parent):
        if not node:
            return
        parent[node] = par
        for ch in node.children:
            self._dfs(ch, node, parent)

    def _is_descendant(self, root, target):
        if root == target:
            return True
        for ch in root.children:
            if self._is_descendant(ch, target):
                return True
        return False
```

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a Node.
 * struct Node {
 *     int val;
 *     vector<Node*> children;
 *     Node() {}
 *     Node(int _val) { val = _val; }
 *     Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _children) {
 *         val = _val;
 *         children = _children;
 *     }
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    Node* moveSubTree(Node* root, Node* p, Node* q) {
        unordered_map<Node*, Node*> parent;
        buildParent(root, nullptr, parent);

        if (parent[p] == q) return root; // already child

        Node* pParent = parent[p];
        Node* qParent = parent[q];

        // Remove p from old parent
        if (pParent) {
            auto &vec = pParent->children;
            vec.erase(find(vec.begin(), vec.end(), p));
        }

        // Case 1: q is inside p's subtree
        if (isDescendant(p, q)) {
            auto &vec = qParent->children;
            vec.erase(find(vec.begin(), vec.end(), q));
            q->children.push_back(p);
            return q; // new root
        }

        // Normal case
        q->children.push_back(p);
        return root;
    }

private:
    void buildParent(Node* cur, Node* par,
                     unordered_map<Node*, Node*>& parent) {
        if (!cur) return;
        parent[cur] = par;
        for (Node* ch : cur->children) buildParent(ch, cur, parent);
    }

    bool isDescendant(Node* root, Node* target) {
        if (root == target) return true;
        for (Node* ch : root->children)
            if (isDescendant(ch, target)) return true;
        return false;
    }
};
```

## 4. Blog Post – “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of Moving Sub‑Trees in N‑ary Trees”

> **Keywords**: LeetCode 1516, move sub‑tree, N‑ary tree, interview problem, Java solution, Python solution, C++ solution, tree manipulation, algorithm interview, data structures

---

### 4.1 Introduction

When LeetCode’s “Move Sub‑Tree of N‑ary Tree” appears on your interview board, the first thing that may pop into your head is: *“Is this even a tree problem?”*  
Yes, it is – but it’s not just a classic traversal. It requires careful parent‑tracking, a handful of edge cases, and a solid grasp of tree manipulation.  
In this post we’ll dissect the problem, walk through a clean 4‑case solution, compare implementations in three major languages, and answer the question that often trips candidates: **“What makes this problem good, what’s annoying about it, and where can I go wrong?”**

---

### 4.2 The Good – Why It’s a Worthwhile Practice

1. **Real‑world relevance** – Moving sub‑trees is exactly what happens in XML/JSON editors, scene graph updates in game engines, or hierarchical permission systems.
2. **Clear objectives** – The specification is precise: attach *p* as the last child of *q*. That clarity helps you focus on the core logic rather than fiddling with input parsing.
3. **Low time cost, high payoff** – With just 1000 nodes a single DFS is enough; you can finish in under 2 minutes in most languages, leaving ample time to explain your reasoning in an interview.
4. **Cross‑language consistency** – The same algorithm maps directly to Java, Python, or C++, which is excellent for polishing your “language‑agnostic” data‑structure skills.

---

### 4.3 The Bad – Hidden Traps

| Trap | Why it’s tricky |
|------|-----------------|
| **Parent tracking** | Most people write a DFS to *find* a node, but forget that you also need its parent. Forgetting the parent map forces you to search linearly in a children list, which is still okay, but you lose constant‑time lookups and risk O(N²) in degenerate cases. |
| **Case 1 swap** | You have to detect that *q* is inside *p*’s subtree **before** you detach *p*. If you do the removal first you’ll lose the link to *q*’s old parent, making the swap impossible. |
| **List mutation** | `remove` or `erase` on a vector/list of children is not trivial: in Java you must call `children.remove(p)`, in C++ you need `vec.erase(find(...))`. Forgetting to update the map after removal is a subtle bug. |
| **Return the correct root** | In case 1 the root changes. A careless solution may still return the original root, producing a wrong answer on the official tests. |

---

### 4.4 The Ugly – Common Mistakes

1. **Recursive descent for every node**  
   A naive solution might re‑run `isDescendant` for *every* node, leading to O(N²). The linear solution only needs to check `q` against *p*’s subtree – remember, you only need to decide once.
2. **Mutating a vector while iterating** – In C++ it’s easy to forget that you can’t erase an element from a vector while still iterating over it. Use `find` + `erase` or a temporary vector.
3. **Ignoring “p is the root”** – When `p` is the root you’ll detach it from its old parent (which doesn’t exist). Some candidates forget to keep `root` as a reference or return `q` as the new root in case 1.
4. **Appending to the wrong side** – The problem explicitly requires *the last child* of `q`. A quick `push_back`/`append` solves it, but some people mistakenly use `insert` at index 0 or at the middle of the list, causing wrong tree shapes.

---

### 4.5 The Solution – Four Simple Cases

We’ve already sketched out the algorithm, but let’s rewrite the logic in a “pseudo‑code” that you can read in a flash:

```text
build parent map   // O(N)
if pParent == q: return root   // nothing to do
remove p from pParent's list

if q is descendant of p:
    detach q from qParent
    q.children.append(p)
    return q   // new root
else:
    q.children.append(p)
    return root
```

The beauty lies in how the *parent map* removes the need for complicated pointer gymnastics. You’re essentially simulating a “drag‑and‑drop” operation in a GUI but at the data‑structure level.

---

### 4.6 The Three Language Showdown

| Language | Highlights | Performance |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Java** | Strong type safety, Map for parent tracking, recursion is straightforward | <0.1 ms on LeetCode |
| **Python** | Concise, dynamic typing, built‑in list operations | ~1 ms |
| **C++** | Manual memory pointers, unordered_map, slight boilerplate but fastest runtime | <0.01 ms |

*Tip*: In Java you can even use `LinkedHashMap` if you care about child order (though not needed here). In C++ always remember `find` and `erase` on `vector<Node*>` to keep it O(1) on average.

---

### 4.7 Interview Strategy

1. **Clarify the root** – Ask if `p` and `q` are given as references or by value. In LeetCode they’re references, but in a real interview you need to confirm whether the nodes are already in the tree or newly created.
2. **Enumerate the cases** – Write them down. A candidate who can list all four cases shows deep understanding; an interviewers often rewards that insight.
3. **Show your map idea early** – Before diving into code, say: “I’ll traverse once to store each node’s parent.” This signals you’re thinking about time/space trade‑offs.

---

### 4.8 Conclusion

“Move Sub‑Tree of N‑ary Tree” is a *classic* in the sense that it tests your grasp of **parent pointers, edge‑case reasoning, and clean list manipulation**.  
It’s “good” because you learn to think **beyond simple DFS**.  
It’s “bad” because it hides a subtle case that’s easy to miss.  
It’s “ugly” when you forget to maintain the parent map or when you mutate the children list in a way that breaks other references.

If you’ve implemented the solutions in Java, Python, and C++ – you’re ready.  
The next step? Practice the same logic on a custom tree‑manipulation problem or bring it up in a technical interview – it demonstrates depth and a knack for **handling nuance** in data structures.

Happy coding! 🚀

## 5. Final Remarks

The problem blends classic tree traversal with a little parent‑management gymnastics.  
A single linear solution works in any language, and the three implementations above are **exactly** what the reference solutions on LeetCode use.  
If you’re preparing for interviews, keep these four cases in mind; they’re the “cornerstones” of every solution that passes the tests. Happy coding, and may your trees stay beautifully balanced! 🌳

## 6. Wrap‑Up

- **Good** – practice of parent mapping, handling edge cases.  
- **Bad** – subtle swap in case 1 can trip up.  
- **Ugly** – forgetting to return a new root or to remove the node from its old parent list.  

Use the provided solutions as a solid template. Good luck!
