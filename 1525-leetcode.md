### 🚀 Introduction

When you’re hunting for a software‑engineering role, one of the first hurdles you’ll encounter is the *coding interview*. LeetCode has become the de‑facto playground for these challenges, and **1525. Number of Good Ways to Split a String** is a prime example of a problem that tests both your *algorithmic thinking* and *language fluency*.

In this article we’ll dissect the problem, walk through a clean O(n) solution, and highlight the **good**, **bad**, and **ugly** aspects of common approaches. Along the way you’ll learn interview‑specific tips and see why the code we provide is a strong addition to your portfolio.

---

### 📌 Problem Statement (Short)

Given a string `s` of lowercase English letters, a *good split* is a position that divides `s` into two non‑empty parts `left` and `right` such that the number of **distinct letters** in `left` equals that in `right`.  
Return the number of good splits.

*Example:*  
`"aacaba"` → 2 good splits (`"aac" | "aba"` and `"aaca" | "ba"`).

---

### ⚙️ Algorithm Overview

The canonical solution follows a **two‑pass frequency technique**:

1. **Frequency Count Pass** – Build a frequency array for all 26 letters in `s`.  
   This gives us the total number of distinct letters in the *entire* string (`totalDistinct`).

2. **Scan Pass** – Walk the string from left to right, moving one character at a time from the *right* side to the *left* side.
   - Decrement its count in the frequency array.
   - Update `leftDistinct` (new distinct letter discovered) and `rightDistinct` (lost last occurrence) accordingly.
   - When `leftDistinct == rightDistinct`, increment the answer.

Because we only use constant‑size arrays and a single linear scan, the algorithm runs in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space.

---

### 🧠 Detailed Walkthrough

Let’s take `s = "aacaba"`.

| Step | i | Char | freq[char] before | freq[char] after | leftDistinct | rightDistinct | good split? |
|------|---|------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | 0 | 'a' | 3 | 2 | 1 (new) | 3 (unchanged) | No |
| 2 | 1 | 'a' | 2 | 1 | 1 (unchanged) | 3 (unchanged) | No |
| 3 | 2 | 'c' | 1 | 0 | 2 (new) | 2 (lost last) | Yes |
| 4 | 3 | 'a' | 0 | 0 | 2 (unchanged) | 2 (unchanged) | Yes |
| 5 | 4 | 'b' | 1 | 0 | 3 (new) | 1 (lost last) | No |

The algorithm correctly counts the two good splits.

#### C++

### 📈 Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| Two‑pass frequency + single scan | **O(n)** | **O(1)** (26‑element arrays) |
| Brute‑force (check every split, O(n²)) | O(n²) | O(1) |
| Using hash‑sets for each prefix/suffix | O(n) | O(n) (worst‑case distinct letters) |

The two‑pass approach dominates the leaderboard and is the most interview‑friendly solution.

---

### 🌟 The Good

- **Simplicity** – No fancy data structures; just arrays.
- **Performance** – Linear time, constant memory; safe for `n = 10⁵`.
- **Language‑agnostic** – Easy to translate between Java, Python, and C++.
- **Explain‑ability** – You can walk the interviewer through the scan step‑by‑step.

---

### ⚠️ The Bad

- **Early‑termination pitfalls** – Some naive solutions forget to exclude the last character (`n-1`), counting an invalid split.
- **Misunderstanding “distinct”** – Counting occurrences instead of unique letters leads to wrong results.
- **Complexity confusion** – A “set‑per‑prefix” approach is tempting but adds O(n) space.

---

### 🐛 The Ugly

- **Off‑by‑one bugs** – Forgetting that the split must be *between* characters.
- **Mutable frequency array mistakes** – Decrementing before or after the equality check can flip the answer.
- **Large input overflow** – In languages like C++ using `int` for counters is fine; in C# you’d need `long`.

---

### 🧑‍💻 Interview‑Specific Tips

1. **Talk through constraints** – Mention `s.length ≤ 10⁵` and that you’re using constant‑size arrays.  
2. **Clarify the definition** – Distinct vs. frequency; ask the interviewer to confirm.
3. **Walk through the scan mentally** – Show how you update `leftDistinct`/`rightDistinct` at each step.
4. **Handle edge cases first** – Empty string, single character string; quickly return 0.
5. **Explain why we use `s.length() - 1`** – Emphasize that the split cannot be at the very end.

---

### 🎯 Takeaway for Job Hunting

- **Add this solution to your GitHub repo** – Mark the language, time, and space complexity in the README.  
- **Use the blog snippet** as a talking point in your coding‑interview portfolio.  
- **Practice explaining the scan** – Interviewers love a clear, step‑wise narrative.

With this problem, you’ve showcased *O(n) reasoning*, *constant‑space optimization*, and *cross‑language prowess*—all skills that top tech companies look for.

### 📣 Closing Thoughts

The *Number of Good Ways to Split a String* problem may look simple, but mastering it gives you a **versatile tool** for a wide range of interview questions involving **prefix/suffix analysis** and **distinct‑character counts**.  

Keep the clean code in your toolkit, and when you see a string‑splitting question, you’ll know exactly why this O(n) solution is both elegant and effective.

Good luck on your next interview—*you’ve got the code, now show it off!* 🚀
