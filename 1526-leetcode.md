        ## 🚀 LeetCode 1526 – Minimum Number of Increments on Subarrays to Form a Target Array  
> **The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly**  
> *A developer’s guide to mastering a classic interview problem (Java, Python & C++)*  

---

### 1️⃣ Problem Overview  

You’re given a **target** array of length *n* (1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵).  
Initially you have an array **initial** of the same length, but every element is **0**.  

One operation: pick any contiguous sub‑array and increment every element inside it by **1**.  
Goal: transform **initial** into **target** using the *fewest possible operations*.

> **Why it matters** – This problem is a favorite on technical interviews (Google, Amazon, etc.) because it forces you to think in terms of *prefixes* and *greedy choices* while keeping the runtime linear.

---

### 2️⃣ Key Insight (The “Gold” nugget)  

If you look at the array one element at a time, the only thing that matters for the
*extra* operations needed is the **difference between the current value and the previous value**.

- **Increase**: when `target[i] > target[i‑1]`  
  → we must perform `target[i] - target[i‑1]` new operations that affect *only* the i‑th element after the previous ones stop incrementing.  
- **No increase**: when `target[i] ≤ target[i‑1]`  
  → nothing new is required; the earlier increments already cover the i‑th element.

The first element is a special case: we have to start from 0, so we need `target[0]` operations.

**Therefore**  
```
answer = target[0] + Σ max(0, target[i] - target[i‑1])   (i = 1 … n‑1)
```

This simple “add the positive differences” rule is a *greedy* algorithm that works in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space.

---

### 2️⃣ Why a Greedy Approach Works  

1. **Locality of Influence** – Any operation that covers index *i* also covers all indices **≤ i**.  
   So the only “extra” work that matters for index *i* is how much it exceeds the previous index.
2. **No benefit from “undoing”** – Decreasing an element would never help because all operations are **increment‑only**.
3. **Monotone Stack Redundancy** – A stack‑based solution (used in many editorial posts) is unnecessary; every element is pushed/popped at most once, so the linear greedy is already optimal.

---

### 3️⃣ Implementation Highlights  

Below you’ll find clean, production‑ready implementations in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
All follow the same O(n) greedy pattern described above.

| Language | Code |
|----------|------|
| **Java** | ```java<br>public int minNumberOperations(int[] target) {<br>    int ops = target[0];<br>    for (int i = 1; i < target.length; i++) {<br>        if (target[i] > target[i-1]) {<br>            ops += target[i] - target[i-1];<br>        }<br>    }<br>    return ops;<br>}<br>``` |
| **Python** | ```python<br>class Solution:<br>    def minNumberOperations(self, target: List[int]) -> int:<br>        ops = target[0]<br>        for i in range(1, len(target)):<br>            if target[i] > target[i-1]:<br>                ops += target[i] - target[i-1]<br>        return ops<br>``` |
| **C++** | ```cpp<br>#include <vector><br>using namespace std;<br>int minNumberOperations(vector<int>& target) {<br>    int ops = target[0];<br>    for (size_t i = 1; i < target.size(); ++i) {<br>        if (target[i] > target[i-1])<br>            ops += target[i] - target[i-1];<br>    }<br>    return ops;<br>}<br>``` |

> **Tip** – The code is intentionally minimal; you can add logging or unit tests around it for production or interview practice.

### 4️⃣ Complexity Analysis  

| Aspect | Complexity |
|--------|------------|
| Time | **O(n)** – one pass over the array |
| Space | **O(1)** – only a few integer variables |

Because *n* can be up to 10⁵, the linear solution is the only one that comfortably fits the time limits on LeetCode and typical coding‑interview platforms.

---

### 5️⃣ Edge Cases & Gotchas  

| Scenario | Why it’s tricky | How to handle it |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| **All elements equal** | You might think you need `n` operations, but you only need the first element. | The greedy sum of differences will add `0` for every pair, so you get `target[0]`. |
| **Strictly decreasing** | The algorithm must not subtract; only the first element matters. | The `if (target[i] > target[i-1])` guard prevents negative additions. |
| **Zeros in the middle** | Some editorial posts mistakenly add absolute differences, leading to wrong counts. | Stick to **positive differences only**; zeros never add extra ops. |
| **Large numbers** | Overflow risk in languages with 32‑bit signed ints. | Use 64‑bit (`long` in Java/Python’s int is unbounded, `long long` in C++). |

---

### 6️⃣ The Good – Why This Is a “Nice” Problem  

- **Linear, O(n)** – No hidden recursion or DP tables.  
- **No data‑structure gymnastics** – Just a couple of comparisons.  
- **Intuitive** – Once you realize “only increasing steps matter”, the answer is obvious.

---

### 7️⃣ The Bad – Common Pitfalls  

- **Thinking “every element needs its own operation”** – leads to O(n²) naive solutions.  
- **Using a stack unnecessarily** – a lot of editorial blogs show stack‑based proofs, but they add O(n) space overhead that’s avoidable.  
- **Mixing up “difference” vs “absolute value”** – some solutions incorrectly take |a-b| when a ≤ b, which inflates the count.

---

### 8️⃣ The Ugly – Why People Struggle With This One  

1. **Misreading the operation**  
   - You can increment *any* sub‑array, not just the whole array.  
   - A common error is to think you can’t “stop” an increment in the middle of a sub‑array; but you can simply choose a shorter sub‑array.

2. **Over‑engineering**  
   - A stack or two‑pointer technique is often overkill.  
   - The greedy logic is simpler and more maintainable; interviewers appreciate that.

3. **Implementation bugs**  
   - Off‑by‑one in the first element.  
   - Forgetting that the first element always contributes to the answer, regardless of its comparison to a previous element (there is none).

---

### 9️⃣ Interview‑Ready Tips  

- **Explain the intuition first** – “We only need to add when the current value exceeds the previous one.”  
- **Show the formula** – `answer = target[0] + Σ max(0, target[i] - target[i‑1])`.  
- **Time & space** – mention O(n) time, O(1) space.  
- **Edge case** – “What if the array starts with 0?” – still covered by `target[0]`.  
- **Optional** – present the stack proof for extra depth, but quickly transition to the greedy core to save time.

---

### 10️⃣ Take‑away Summary  

- **Greedy** is the correct strategy because each index’s requirement only depends on the *previous* index.
- The solution is **O(n)** time, **O(1)** space – perfect for large *n* up to 10⁵.
- Avoid the stack; it’s elegant but unnecessary for this problem.
- In an interview, highlight the key insight first; then give the succinct code.
