        ## 🎯 1542 – Find Longest Awesome Substring  
**Hard | 10‑digit alphabet | O(n · 10)**  

> “An awesome substring is a non‑empty substring of `s` that can be rearranged (by any number of swaps) into a palindrome.”  
> **Goal:** Return the length of the longest awesome substring.

## 🚀 1.  What Makes a Substring “Awesome”?

For a string of digits, a palindrome requires:

| # of odd‑count digits | possible? |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| 0 or 1                | yes       |
| 2 or more             | no        |

So a substring is awesome **iff** *at most one* digit appears an odd number of times.

---

## 🔑 2.  Prefix Bitmask + HashMap

### Idea  
* Keep a 10‑bit mask that stores the parity (even/odd) of each digit count up to the current position.  
* `mask`’s bits: bit `d` is 1 if digit `d` has appeared an odd number of times so far.

For any two indices `i < j`  
`mask[i] XOR mask[j]` gives the parity of the substring `s[i+1 … j]`.  
If that XOR has 0 or a single bit set → the substring is awesome.

### Algorithm

1. `first[mask]` = first index where `mask` was seen (initially `-1` for all).  
   `first[0] = -1` because an empty prefix has mask 0.
2. Iterate through the string (index `i` 0‑based):
   * Update current mask: `mask ^= 1 << (s[i] - '0')`.
   * **Case 1 – Direct match**  
     If `first[mask] != -1`, the substring from `first[mask]+1` to `i` is awesome.  
     Update answer: `ans = max(ans, i - first[mask])`.
   * **Case 2 – Flip one bit**  
     For each `d` in 0..9, consider `mask ^ (1<<d)`.  
     If that mask was seen, the substring between that index+1 and `i` has at most one odd digit.  
     Update `ans` with `i - first[mask ^ (1<<d)]`.
   * Store the first occurrence: `if (first[mask] == -1) first[mask] = i`.
3. Return `ans`.

### Why It Works  
The mask fully characterizes the parity of digit counts.  
Two equal masks → every digit has even count → palindrome possible.  
Two masks differing by one bit → exactly one odd digit → still palindrome possible.  

---

## ⚡ 3.  Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Updating mask & checking 10 flips | `O(10)` per character → `O(n·10)` (≈ `O(n)`) |  |
| HashMap / array of 1024 entries | `O(1)` per lookup | `O(1024)` ≈ `O(1)` |

Total: **O(n)** time, **O(1)** auxiliary space.

## 📦 4.  Code – 3 Languages

### Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int longestAwesome(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        // 10‑bit masks → 1024 possible values
        int[] first = new int[1 << 10];
        Arrays.fill(first, -1);
        first[0] = -1;               // empty prefix

        int mask = 0;
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int d = s.charAt(i) - '0';
            mask ^= 1 << d;                 // toggle parity

            // direct match
            if (first[mask] != -1)
                ans = Math.max(ans, i - first[mask]);

            // flip one bit (at most one odd digit)
            for (int bit = 0; bit < 10; bit++) {
                int m2 = mask ^ (1 << bit);
                if (first[m2] != -1)
                    ans = Math.max(ans, i - first[m2]);
            }

            // record first occurrence
            if (first[mask] == -1)
                first[mask] = i;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

> **Why `first[0] = -1`?**  
> The substring that starts at index 0 is simply `i - (-1) = i+1`.  
> It keeps the code symmetrical.

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def longestAwesome(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        first = [-1] * 1024
        first[0] = -1          # empty prefix

        mask = 0
        ans = 0

        for i, ch in enumerate(s):
            d = ord(ch) - 48   # int(ch)
            mask ^= 1 << d

            # same mask → all even
            if first[mask] != -1:
                ans = max(ans, i - first[mask])

            # flip one bit → at most one odd
            for bit in range(10):
                m2 = mask ^ (1 << bit)
                if first[m2] != -1:
                    ans = max(ans, i - first[m2])

            # store first occurrence
            if first[mask] == -1:
                first[mask] = i

        return ans
```

> The `ord(ch) - 48` trick is marginally faster than `int(ch)` for tight loops.

### C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestAwesome(string s) {
        const int SZ = 1 << 10;          // 1024
        vector<int> first(SZ, -1);
        first[0] = -1;

        int mask = 0;
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); ++i) {
            int d = s[i] - '0';
            mask ^= 1 << d;

            // same mask
            if (first[mask] != -1)
                ans = max(ans, i - first[mask]);

            // flip one bit
            for (int bit = 0; bit < 10; ++bit) {
                int m2 = mask ^ (1 << bit);
                if (first[m2] != -1)
                    ans = max(ans, i - first[m2]);
            }

            if (first[mask] == -1)
                first[mask] = i;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### 📖 1. Problem Recap

- **Awesome Substring**: any substring that can be rearranged into a palindrome.
- **Task**: find the longest such substring in a digit string (length ≤ 100 000).

> **Why it matters**  
> Palindrome‑based problems show mastery of counting, bit tricks, and prefix data structures – all core interview topics.

---

### 🔍 2. Intuition – What Makes a Palindrome?

| Palindrome condition | Explanation |
|----------------------|-------------|
| All characters occur an even number of times | Mirror positions can pair. |
| Exactly one odd count | The odd character sits in the middle. |

Thus *at most one odd digit* is the necessary & sufficient condition.

---

### 🧩 3. The Elegant Solution – Bitmask + HashMap

#### 3.1  Represent Parity with a 10‑bit Mask
```
bit d (0–9) = 1  ⇔  digit d has appeared an odd number of times so far
```

*Example:*  
After processing `"24241"` → mask = `0b0000100010` (digits 2 & 4 odd).

#### 3.2  Substring Parity = XOR of Prefix Masks
If `pref[i]` is mask after `i` characters, the parity of substring `(i+1 … j)` is  
`pref[i] XOR pref[j]`.

So we only need to know whether that XOR has 0 or 1 bit set.

#### 3.3  Storing First Occurrences
For every mask value, remember the earliest index where it appeared (`first[mask]`).  
When we encounter the same mask again, the substring between them has **zero** odd digits → palindrome possible.

When we flip one bit in the current mask, we look for a mask that differs by exactly one digit.  
If that mask existed before, the substring has **one** odd digit → palindrome possible.

#### 3.4  Why 10 Bits?
There are only 10 distinct digits (0‑9).  
All masks fit in an integer: `2^10 = 1024` possible states → small array, O(1) look‑ups.

### 🚦 4. Common Pitfalls (“The Bad”)

| Pitfall | What Happens | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Forget to set `first[0] = -1` | Off‑by‑one errors for substrings starting at index 0 | Initialize first occurrence of mask 0 as `-1` |
| Using `HashMap<Integer, Integer>` with 1024 keys | Works but slower | Use plain array (`int[1024]`) for speed |
| Forgetting to record **first** occurrence only | Wrong length for overlapping substrings | Only set `first[mask] = i` when it’s still `-1` |
| Using `int` for mask in languages with 32‑bit signed ints? | Overflow when toggling bits beyond 31 | Always use 32‑bit `int`; 10 bits are safe |

---

### 🏆 5. The “Nice” – Time & Space

| | Java | Python | C++ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Time | O(n · 10) ≈ O(n) | O(n · 10) | O(n · 10) |
| Space | O(1) (array of 1024) | O(1) | O(1) |

All solutions comfortably run within 100 ms for the maximum input size.

---

### 💡 6. Variants & Extensions

| Variation | How to Adapt |
|-----------|--------------|
| Alphabet size > 10 | Increase mask size (`1 << |alphabet|`). Memory grows exponentially; use hashmap if > 20. |
| Need longest substring, not length | Store earliest index for each mask; reconstruct substring from indices. |
| Online query | Maintain prefix masks; answer queries by checking masks between indices. |
