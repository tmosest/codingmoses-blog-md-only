        # 1558 ‚Äì Minimum Numbers of Function Calls to Make Target Array  
**(Java | Python | C++)**  

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Recap  

You‚Äôre given an integer array **`nums`**.  
You start with an array **`arr`** of the same length, all zeros.  
You may call one of two operations any number of times:

| Operation | Effect |
|---|---|
| `increment(i)` | Increase *arr[i]* by 1. |
| `double()` | Multiply **every** element in `arr` by 2. |

Your goal is to transform `arr` into `nums` with the **fewest** total operations.  
Return that minimum number of operations.

> **Constraints**  
> * 1¬†‚â§¬†`nums.length`¬†‚â§¬†10‚Åµ  
> * 0¬†‚â§¬†`nums[i]`¬†‚â§¬†10‚Åπ  
> * The answer always fits in a 32‚Äëbit signed integer.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Key Insight ‚Äì Think in Reverse  

If we *build* a number from 0 to its final value, every `1` bit forces us to use an `increment`.  
Every time we shift a binary representation left (i.e., multiply by 2), we use a `double`.  

**Reverse View**  
Start with the final numbers and peel them back to zero:

1. While a number is odd ‚Üí we must have performed an `increment`.  
   (Remove that `1` by subtracting 1 ‚Üí equivalent to `num & (num‚Äë1)` in bits.)
2. Every time the number is even ‚Üí a `double` was applied earlier.  
   (Divide by 2 ‚Üí shift right.)

So:

* **Number of increments** = total pop‚Äëcount of all numbers.  
* **Number of doubles** = *maximum* number of right‚Äëshifts needed for any element  
  = `(max bit‚Äëlength) ‚Äì 1`.

The ‚Äú‚Äì1‚Äù appears because the array starts at 0; the very first `double` is unnecessary if all numbers are zero.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Final Algorithm (Greedy & Bit‚ÄëLevel)

```text
steps_inc  = 0
max_shift  = 0

for each x in nums:
    # Count 1‚Äëbits (increments)
    steps_inc += popcount(x)

    # Track how many shifts (doubles) are required
    if x > 0:
        shifts = floor(log2(x))          # or bit_length - 1
        max_shift = max(max_shift, shifts)

return steps_inc + max_shift
```

*Time Complexity* ‚Äì **O(n‚ÄØlog‚ÄØM)**, where `M` is the maximum element.  
*Space Complexity* ‚Äì **O(1)**.

Because `nums[i] ‚â§ 10‚Åπ`, `log‚ÇÇ(M)` ‚â§ 30, so the algorithm is effectively linear in practice.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Reference Implementation  

### 4.1 Java  

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        int addOps = 0;
        int maxShift = 0;

        for (int x : nums) {
            // Count 1‚Äëbits
            addOps += Integer.bitCount(x);

            // Number of doubles needed for this element
            if (x > 0) {
                int shift = 31 - Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(x); // floor(log2(x))
                maxShift = Math.max(maxShift, shift);
            }
        }
        return addOps + maxShift;
    }
}
```

> **Why `31 - numberOfLeadingZeros`?**  
> Java‚Äôs `Integer.bitCount` gives pop‚Äëcount.  
> `Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros` returns how many leading zero bits a 32‚Äëbit int has;  
> subtracting from 31 yields the index of the highest set bit.

---

### 4.2 Python  

```python
def min_operations(nums):
    add_ops = 0
    max_shift = 0

    for x in nums:
        add_ops += bin(x).count('1')          # popcount
        if x:
            shift = x.bit_length() - 1        # floor(log2(x))
            max_shift = max(max_shift, shift)

    return add_ops + max_shift
```

*Note:* `int.bit_length()` returns the number of bits needed to represent the number in binary, i.e., `floor(log2(x)) + 1`.

---

### 4.3 C++  

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long addOps = 0;          // use long long to avoid overflow during counting
        int maxShift = 0;

        for (int x : nums) {
            addOps += __builtin_popcount(x);   // popcount

            if (x) {
                int shift = 31 - __builtin_clz(x);   // floor(log2(x))
                maxShift = max(maxShift, shift);
            }
        }
        return static_cast<int>(addOps + maxShift);
    }
};
```

`__builtin_clz` counts leading zeros; `31 - clz(x)` is the highest set bit index.

### üìÑ Article

#### 5.1 Introduction  
When preparing for a software‚Äëengineering interview, the *‚ÄúMinimum Numbers of Function Calls to Make Target Array‚Äù* problem often surfaces. It tests your ability to think *reverse* and leverage **bit manipulation** to achieve optimal time complexity. Below we dissect the problem, walk through an elegant greedy solution, and compare it against less efficient alternatives.

#### 5.2 Problem Restatement  
We start with an array of zeros and two operations: `increment(i)` (add 1 to a single element) and `double()` (multiply every element by 2). Our task is to transform the zero‚Äëarray into the target array `nums` with the **fewest** total operations.

#### 5.3 The ‚ÄúGood‚Äù ‚Äì Greedy Bit‚ÄëLevel Approach  
- **Simplicity**: Only two counters are needed ‚Äì one for increments (`popcount` sum) and one for doubles (`max bit‚Äëlength ‚Äì 1`).  
- **Time Efficiency**: O(n‚ÄØlog‚ÄØM) where M ‚â§ 10‚Åπ, which is essentially linear.  
- **Space Efficiency**: O(1).  
- **Intuitive Logic**: Every `1` bit demands an increment; each left shift demands a double.  
- **Language‚Äëagnostic**: The same logic works in Java, Python, and C++ with minimal syntax differences.

#### 5.4 The ‚ÄúBad‚Äù ‚Äì Brute‚ÄëForce Simulation  
A na√Øve simulation would:

1. Iterate through each element, performing increments and doubles on the array itself until it matches `nums`.  
2. Each operation would modify the whole array, leading to O(n‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ#operations) time.  
3. This quickly explodes for `nums.length = 10‚Åµ` and large numbers (up to 10‚Åπ).  
4. Moreover, it uses O(n) extra space to store intermediate arrays.

**Why it‚Äôs a bad idea**: It doesn‚Äôt exploit the mathematical structure of the problem and leads to timeouts on real interview platforms.

#### 5.5 The ‚ÄúUgly‚Äù ‚Äì Over‚ÄëOptimized Math with Logs  
Some solutions try to pre‚Äëcompute the maximum number of doubles by repeatedly dividing the maximum number by 2:

```java
int maxShift = 0;
int x = *max(nums);
while (x > 0) { maxShift++; x /= 2; }
```

While correct, this approach:

- Uses integer division in a loop ‚Äì still O(log‚ÄØM) but less readable.  
- Requires an extra pass to find the maximum.  
- Misses the more concise bit‚Äëlength calculation (`Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros`).  

The resulting code can be less maintainable and harder to understand at a glance.

#### 5.6 Final Thoughts & Interview Tips  
- **Explain the reverse perspective**: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre peeling back the binary digits.‚Äù  
- **Mention popcount**: Many interviewers love that you use built‚Äëin bit tricks (`__builtin_popcount`, `Integer.bitCount`).  
- **State time and space complexity** upfront.  
- **Be ready to discuss edge cases**: All zeros, single element, large numbers.  
- **Show the code in your chosen language** ‚Äì Java, Python, or C++ ‚Äì and emphasize that the logic remains the same.

#### 5.7 Wrap‚ÄëUp  
The LeetCode 1558 problem exemplifies how a seemingly complex operation set collapses into a clean, linear solution when viewed through the lens of binary representation. Master this approach, and you‚Äôll have a strong talking point for any algorithm interview.

### üöÄ Conclusion  

- **Java** ‚Äì Use `Integer.bitCount` and `Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros`.  
- **Python** ‚Äì Use `bin(x).count('1')` and `x.bit_length()`.  
- **C++** ‚Äì Use `__builtin_popcount` and `__builtin_clz`.

All three solutions run in linear time and constant space, perfectly suited for the constraints of LeetCode 1558. Good luck in your next interview!
