        ## 🏁 1560 – Most Visited Sector in a Circular Track  
**Solution in Java, Python & C++ + SEO‑optimized blog article**

---

### 📚 Problem Summary  

You have a circular track with `n` sectors numbered `1 … n`.  
A marathon consists of `m` rounds.  
`rounds[i]` is the sector where the **i‑th** round starts,  
`rounds[i+1]` is where the **i‑th** round ends (0‑based index).

During a round you always move **clockwise** (i.e. from a smaller number to a larger one, wrapping around from `n` back to `1`).

**Goal** – return the sector(s) that are visited the most times, sorted increasingly.

> *Why this matters?*  
> The problem tests your ability to reason about circular data structures, boundary conditions, and simple greedy counting.

---

## ✅ 1. Core Observation

If you walk around the whole circle once, every sector is visited exactly once – it doesn’t change the ranking of “most visited”.  
Therefore, only the *partial walk* from the **first** sector (`rounds[0]`) to the **last** sector (`rounds[rounds.length-1]`) matters.

So the answer is simply **all sectors that lie on the clockwise path from the start to the end**.

---

## 📐 2. Algorithm

```
start = rounds[0]
end   = rounds[last]

if start <= end:
    answer = [start, start+1, … , end]
else:                      # wrap‑around case
    answer = [start, start+1, … , n] + [1, 2, … , end]
```

* The list is naturally sorted because we walk in ascending order (wrapping around if necessary).
* Time complexity: **O(n)** – at most we iterate over the whole circle once.
* Space complexity: **O(n)** – the output list itself.

## 🗝️ 3. Code Implementations

### Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> mostVisited(int n, int[] rounds) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        int start = rounds[0];
        int end   = rounds[rounds.length - 1];

        if (start <= end) {
            for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) res.add(i);
        } else {
            for (int i = start; i <= n; i++) res.add(i);
            for (int i = 1; i <= end; i++)   res.add(i);
        }
        return res;
    }

    // Optional: simple main for quick manual testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution s = new Solution();
        System.out.println(s.mostVisited(4, new int[]{1,3,1,2})); // [1, 2]
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def mostVisited(self, n: int, rounds: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        start, end = rounds[0], rounds[-1]
        res = []

        if start <= end:
            res = list(range(start, end + 1))
        else:
            res = list(range(start, n + 1)) + list(range(1, end + 1))

        return res


# Quick test
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(Solution().mostVisited(4, [1, 3, 1, 2]))  # [1, 2]
```

### C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> mostVisited(int n, const std::vector<int>& rounds) {
        std::vector<int> res;
        int start = rounds.front();
        int end   = rounds.back();

        if (start <= end) {
            for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) res.push_back(i);
        } else {
            for (int i = start; i <= n; ++i) res.push_back(i);
            for (int i = 1; i <= end; ++i)   res.push_back(i);
        }
        return res;           // already sorted
    }
};
```

*LeetCode 1560: Most Visited Sector in a Circular Track*

---

### ✨ Introduction  

LeetCode’s *“Most Visited Sector in a Circular Track”* is a deceptively simple problem that turns into a great talking point in coding interviews.  
In this post we’ll unpack the **good**, **bad**, and **ugly** parts of the problem, present a clean solution, and sprinkle some SEO magic so recruiters notice you.

---

#### 📌 Why This Problem Is a Goldmine for Interviews

| What recruiters look for | Why this problem hits the mark |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Handling circular arrays | The wrap‑around logic is common in real systems (circular buffers, ring topologies). |
| Recognizing redundant work | The “full circle” observation shows you can prune unnecessary calculations. |
| Clear complexity analysis | You can discuss O(n) time & O(n) space in a minute. |
| Implementation in multiple languages | Demonstrates language‑agnostic thinking. |

---

## 1️⃣ The Good –  Easy, Elegant, & Efficient

- **O(1) Observation**: Visiting the entire circle once does not affect the ranking.  
  You only need to care about the partial walk.
- **Simplicity**: The solution is a single linear pass, no auxiliary counters or maps.
- **Deterministic Output**: The result is always sorted – no extra sorting step needed.
- **Language‑agnostic**: Works the same way in Java, Python, C++, and most other languages.

---

## 2️⃣ The Bad –  Hidden Traps & Edge Cases

| Trap | Explanation | How to Avoid |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Wrong wrap‑around direction** | The problem says “counter‑clockwise” in the statement, but the examples move **clockwise**. Misreading leads to reversed output. | Double‑check the wording, look at the example trace. |
| **Off‑by‑one errors** | Including or excluding the start or end sector incorrectly. | Use inclusive ranges (`<=`) when traversing, as in the code snippets. |
| **Large `n` vs. small `rounds`** | Some people pre‑allocate an array of size `n` for counting, which is unnecessary. | Just build the answer list directly from the range logic. |
| **Assuming `m` rounds** | `rounds` length is `m + 1`. The last element is the *ending* sector, not a round itself. | Treat `rounds[0]` as start, `rounds.back()` as end. |

---

## 3️⃣ The Ugly –  Over‑engineering & Performance Pitfalls

- **Using a `HashMap` or `int[]` counter**:  
  Counting visits for every sector then scanning for the maximum introduces **O(n)** extra memory and complexity with no gain.
- **Multiple passes**:  
  Building a visited list, then filtering for max, then sorting again – unnecessary passes.
- **Ignoring the problem’s constraints**:  
  Some solutions use recursion or DFS, blowing up the stack for large inputs.

**Takeaway**: Keep it simple. The path from start to end is the answer – nothing more.
