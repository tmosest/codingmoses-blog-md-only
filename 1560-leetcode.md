## 1. Problem Summary

You run a marathon on a circular track with `n` sectors numbered **1 … n**.  
The race consists of `m` rounds.  
`rounds[i]` (0‑based) is the sector where the *i‑th* round starts; the round ends at sector `rounds[i+1]`.  
The runner always moves in ascending sector order, wrapping around from `n` back to `1`.

Return all sectors that are visited the **maximum** number of times, sorted ascending.

> **Example**  
> `n = 4, rounds = [1,3,1,2] → [1,2]`  
> The runner visits sectors `1` and `2` twice; all others only once.

---

## 2. Key Insight

Every *full* cycle around the track increases every sector’s visit count by 1, so it never changes the *relative* maximum.  
Only the **partial** part from the first sector to the last sector matters.

Let:

- `start = rounds[0]`
- `end   = rounds[rounds.length-1]`

If `start ≤ end`, the runner visits sectors `start … end` inclusive.  
If `start > end`, the path wraps:  
`start … n` **then** `1 … end`.  
All those sectors are the ones that receive the most visits.

This gives a direct **O(n)** solution with **O(n)** extra space.

## 4. Code

### 4.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> mostVisited(int n, int[] rounds) {
        int start = rounds[0];
        int end   = rounds[rounds.length - 1];
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();

        if (start <= end) {
            for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) result.add(i);
        } else {
            for (int i = 1; i <= end; i++) result.add(i);
            for (int i = start; i <= n; i++) result.add(i);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def mostVisited(self, n: int, rounds: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        start, end = rounds[0], rounds[-1]
        if start <= end:
            return list(range(start, end + 1))
        return list(range(1, end + 1)) + list(range(start, n + 1))
```

### 4.3 C++

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> mostVisited(int n, const std::vector<int>& rounds) {
        int start = rounds.front();
        int end   = rounds.back();
        std::vector<int> res;
        if (start <= end) {
            for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) res.push_back(i);
        } else {
            for (int i = 1; i <= end; ++i) res.push_back(i);
            for (int i = start; i <= n; ++i) res.push_back(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

All three solutions run in **O(n)** time and use only the output list as extra space.

### 5.1 Introduction

When you’re preparing for coding interviews, LeetCode’s “Most Visited Sector in a Circular Track” (Problem 1560) often pops up. It’s an **easy** question that teaches you to think about *partial* versus *full* loops and about how a circular structure can be handled with simple math.

In this article we’ll dissect:

1. **The Good** – The elegant idea that only the start–end window matters.  
2. **The Bad** – What many beginners do (simulate the whole marathon) and why it’s wasteful.  
3. **The Ugly** – Edge cases that trip people up (start > end, single‑sector wrap‑around).

We’ll finish with clean, ready‑to‑paste code for **Java, Python, and C++**.

### 5.2 The Good – One‑Pass Window

The key observation is that a **full circle** adds `+1` to every sector’s visit count. That doesn’t change which sector is most visited. Thus, only the **partial segment** from the first sector to the last sector matters.

- If the first sector (`start`) is **≤** the last sector (`end`), the path is simply `start … end`.  
- If `start > end`, the runner wraps around:  
  `start … n` **then** `1 … end`.

These sectors are visited one extra time compared to the rest, so they’re the answer.

---

### 5.3 The Bad – Naïve Simulation

A common mistake is to simulate the entire marathon:  
```
for i in range(m):
    traverse from rounds[i] to rounds[i+1]  # step by step
```
This is **O(m * n)** in the worst case, and for the given constraints (`n, m <= 100`) it still passes, but it’s unnecessary and confusing. The clean window approach is **O(n)** and easier to reason about.

---

### 5.4 The Ugly – Edge Cases

| Case | Why it matters | Fix |
|------|----------------|-----|
| `start > end` | Wrap‑around path splits into two ranges. | Handle separately. |
| Single sector track (`n = 2`, many rounds) | You might think “only sector 2” but the logic still holds. | The algorithm automatically returns the right set. |
| All sectors visited equally (`rounds = [1, 3, 5, 7]` with `n=7`) | The window covers the entire circle. | Our logic returns `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`. |

---

### 5.5 Code Snapshots

**Java**

```java
public List<Integer> mostVisited(int n, int[] rounds) {
    int start = rounds[0];
    int end   = rounds[rounds.length-1];
    List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();

    if (start <= end) {
        for (int i=start; i<=end; i++) ans.add(i);
    } else {
        for (int i=1; i<=end; i++) ans.add(i);
        for (int i=start; i<=n; i++) ans.add(i);
    }
    return ans;
}
```

**Python**

```python
def mostVisited(n, rounds):
    start, end = rounds[0], rounds[-1]
    if start <= end:
        return list(range(start, end+1))
    return list(range(1, end+1)) + list(range(start, n+1))
```

**C++**

```cpp
vector<int> mostVisited(int n, const vector<int>& rounds) {
    int start = rounds.front();
    int end   = rounds.back();
    vector<int> res;
    if (start <= end) {
        for (int i=start; i<=end; ++i) res.push_back(i);
    } else {
        for (int i=1; i<=end; ++i) res.push_back(i);
        for (int i=start; i<=n; ++i) res.push_back(i);
    }
    return res;
}
```

All three run in **O(n)** time, **O(n)** space, and use no extra data structures beyond the result list.

### 5.6 Why This Solves Interviews

1. **Clear Thinking** – You isolate the *partial* path, a common interview technique to reduce complexity.  
2. **Time Efficiency** – O(n) is optimal; interviewers love solutions that reason about constraints.  
3. **Language Agnosticism** – The same idea maps to Java, Python, C++ – a great talking point.

---

### 5.7 Final Thoughts

- **Good**: The elegant “start‑to‑end window” reduces the problem to two simple ranges.  
- **Bad**: Simulating every step is overkill and obscures the insight.  
- **Ugly**: Edge cases (wrap‑around, full‑circle) are easy to miss; the window approach automatically handles them.

Implement this solution, understand the underlying intuition, and you’ll ace not only LeetCode 1560 but any interview question that involves circular arrays or path counting.
