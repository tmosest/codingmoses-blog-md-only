        ## 🚀 1564. Put Boxes Into the Warehouse I – Multi‑Language Solution & SEO‑Optimized Blog

---

### TL;DR  
| Language | Time | Space | Key Idea |
|----------|------|-------|----------|
| **Java** | `O(n log n + m log m)` | `O(n)` | Sort boxes → prefix minima of warehouse → two‑pointer |
| **Python** | `O(n log n + m log m)` | `O(n)` | Same greedy strategy with `list.sort()` |
| **C++** | `O(n log n + m log m)` | `O(n)` | `std::sort` + `vector` + two‑pointer |

The solution works in **O((N+M) log (N+M))** time and **O(N)** extra space, where  
`N = boxes.length` and `M = warehouse.length`.

### 1️⃣ Problem Recap (Put Boxes Into the Warehouse I)

You’re given two integer arrays:

* `boxes` – heights of individual boxes (unit width).  
* `warehouse` – heights of consecutive rooms in a warehouse.

You can **push boxes left‑to‑right** into the warehouse, but **no stacking** is allowed.  
If a box is taller than the current room, it and all following boxes stop before that room.

**Goal:**  
Return the maximum number of boxes that can be placed in the warehouse.

---

### 2️⃣ The Good – A Simple Greedy Insight

The **critical observation** is that the “effective” height of a room is the minimum of all rooms to its left (including itself).  
If you move from the **rightmost** room leftwards, you only need to know whether the current smallest‑available box can fit into that effective height.

Why greedy works:

1. **Sort boxes ascending** – we try to place the *shortest* boxes first.  
2. **Traverse warehouse from right to left** – we encounter rooms with non‑decreasing effective heights.  
3. If the smallest remaining box fits, we place it; otherwise, that room can’t accommodate any remaining box (because all remaining boxes are equal or taller).  
4. Continue until we run out of boxes or rooms.

This strategy guarantees the maximum count because each placement only consumes one box and one room, and we always use the “cheapest” room for the “cheapest” box.

### 3️⃣ The Bad – Edge Cases That Trip New Coders

| Edge Case | Why It Matters | What to Check |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| `boxes` or `warehouse` empty | LeetCode guarantees length ≥ 1, but defensive code protects against future changes. | `if (boxes.length==0 || warehouse.length==0) return 0;` |
| Large values (`10⁹`) | Sorting and comparisons still work; watch out for overflow in languages like C/C++ if you ever add values. | Use `long long` for safety if summing. |
| Duplicate heights | Greedy still works, but the prefix minima might stay the same for many rooms. | No special handling needed. |
| `warehouse` with strictly decreasing heights | The prefix minima will be the last room’s height; the algorithm still works. | No change. |

### 4️⃣ The Ugly – Why Some People Get Confused

1. **Confusing “prefix minima” with “suffix minima”**  
   Many solutions mistakenly compute a suffix minima (from right to left). That’s wrong because the height of room `i` depends on all rooms *before* it, not after.  
2. **Two‑pointer vs. stack**  
   Some solutions build a stack of decreasing heights to simulate the greedy process. While correct, it obscures the logic and uses more memory.  
3. **Wrong loop direction**  
   If you traverse `warehouse` from left to right and try to match boxes in sorted order, you may prematurely “block” a taller box behind a shorter one.  
4. **Off‑by‑one errors**  
   Be careful with indices: prefix array index `i` refers to room `i`, while the two‑pointer loop processes `j` from `M‑1` down to `0`.

### 5️⃣ Full Code – 3 Languages

> **Note**: All three implementations share the same core logic. They are written with readability and interview‑friendly style in mind.

#### 5.1 Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maxBoxesInWarehouse(int[] boxes, int[] warehouse) {
        // Edge cases are not necessary because LeetCode guarantees lengths >= 1
        Arrays.sort(boxes);          // ascending order

        // Compute prefix minima of warehouse heights
        int[] pref = new int[warehouse.length];
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < warehouse.length; i++) {
            min = Math.min(min, warehouse[i]);
            pref[i] = min;
        }

        int count = 0;   // number of boxes placed
        int boxIdx = 0;  // next smallest box to place

        // Traverse warehouse from right to left
        for (int j = warehouse.length - 1; j >= 0 && boxIdx < boxes.length; j--) {
            if (pref[j] >= boxes[boxIdx]) {
                count++;
                boxIdx++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### 5.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def maxBoxesInWarehouse(self, boxes: List[int], warehouse: List[int]) -> int:
        boxes.sort()  # ascending

        # Prefix minima of warehouse
        pref = []
        cur_min = float('inf')
        for h in warehouse:
            cur_min = min(cur_min, h)
            pref.append(cur_min)

        count = 0
        box_idx = 0

        # Traverse from right to left
        for j in range(len(warehouse) - 1, -1, -1):
            if box_idx == len(boxes):
                break
            if pref[j] >= boxes[box_idx]:
                count += 1
                box_idx += 1

        return count
```

#### 5.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxBoxesInWarehouse(vector<int>& boxes, vector<int>& warehouse) {
        sort(boxes.begin(), boxes.end());          // ascending

        // Prefix minima of warehouse
        vector<int> pref(warehouse.size());
        int curMin = INT_MAX;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < warehouse.size(); ++i) {
            curMin = min(curMin, warehouse[i]);
            pref[i] = curMin;
        }

        int count = 0;
        size_t boxIdx = 0;

        // Traverse from right to left
        for (int j = (int)warehouse.size() - 1; j >= 0 && boxIdx < boxes.size(); --j) {
            if (pref[j] >= boxes[boxIdx]) {
                ++count;
                ++boxIdx;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### 6️⃣ Complexity Analysis

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Sort `boxes` | `O(n log n)` | `O(1)` (in‑place) |
| Compute prefix minima | `O(m)` | `O(m)` (prefix array) |
| Two‑pointer scan | `O(m)` | `O(1)` |
| **Total** | `O((n + m) log (n + m))` | `O(m)` |

With `n, m ≤ 10⁵`, this comfortably fits LeetCode limits.

### 7️⃣ Take‑aways for Interviewers & Candidates

1. **Greedy + prefix minima** is the canonical solution.  
2. Sorting the boxes first (ascending) is the key to “fit the smallest first” strategy.  
3. Always remember that a room’s *effective* height is the minimum of itself and all previous rooms.  
4. Avoid confusion between prefix and suffix minima—draw a diagram!  
5. The algorithm is easily implementable in any language; focus on clean code and clear variable names.
