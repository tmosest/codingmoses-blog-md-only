        ## 🚀 LeetCode 158 – “Read N Characters Given Read4 II (Call Multiple Times)”
### The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly – Mastering a Hard Interview Problem

> **Meta‑Description** – Want to land that tech interview?  
> Learn how to crack LeetCode 158 with clear Java, Python, and C++ solutions, an in‑depth analysis of pitfalls, and the “buffer trick” that makes this hard problem easy.  

---

### 1. Problem Recap

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Title** | Read N Characters Given Read4 II – Call Multiple Times |
| **Difficulty** | Hard |
| **Source** | LeetCode |
| **Constraints** | `1 <= file.length <= 500`, `1 <= queries[i] <= 500` |
| **Goal** | Implement `read(char[] buf, int n)` that reads *up to* `n` characters from a file, but you can only read the file through the provided `read4(char[] buf4)` API. The `read` function may be called multiple times. |

The `read4` API internally keeps a file pointer, just like `FILE *fp` in C. It reads at most four characters, writes them into `buf4`, and returns the number of characters actually read.

The hard part: **`read` may be called repeatedly** – you must keep any unread characters between calls.

---

### 2. Naïve Approach & Why It Fails

```java
public int read(char[] buf, int n) {
    char[] temp = new char[4];
    int read = 0;
    while (read < n) {
        int cnt = read4(temp);
        if (cnt == 0) break;           // EOF
        for (int i = 0; i < cnt && read < n; i++) {
            buf[read++] = temp[i];
        }
    }
    return read;
}
```

*Works on the first call*, but on subsequent calls you **lose any characters that were read beyond `n`**.  
If `read(4)` reads 4 chars and you only need 2, the remaining 2 are discarded – violating the “call multiple times” requirement.

---

### 3. The “Buffer Trick” – The Good

The idea is to **store any excess characters** from `read4` in a *small temporary buffer* that persists between calls. Think of it as a sliding window over the file:

```
[Buffered 4‑char chunk]  ←  buf4
   ^                    ↑
   |                    |
bufPtr                 bufCnt
```

* `bufPtr` – index into the stored chunk (how many of the 4 chars have already been consumed).
* `bufCnt` – number of valid chars currently stored (≤ 4).

Algorithm (pseudo‑code):

```
totalRead = 0
while totalRead < n:
    if bufPtr == 0:          // Need fresh data
        bufCnt = read4(buf4)
        if bufCnt == 0: break   // EOF

    // Copy from the stored chunk to the caller’s buffer
    while totalRead < n and bufPtr < bufCnt:
        buf[totalRead++] = buf4[bufPtr++]

    if bufPtr == bufCnt:   // Chunk exhausted
        bufPtr = 0
return totalRead
```

The key points:

* **Persisted state**: `buf4`, `bufPtr`, `bufCnt` are *instance variables*, not local to `read()`.
* **O(1) extra space**: only 4 chars are stored regardless of file size.
* **O(n) time**: each requested char is processed once.

### 4. Code – Java, Python, C++

> **NOTE**: On LeetCode the `read4` function is *already* defined; you only need to extend `Reader4` (or `Reader4` is a helper class in the platform).  
> All three snippets below are ready to paste into the online editor.

#### 4.1 Java

```java
// Java 17
public class Solution extends Reader4 {

    // Temporary buffer of size 4 (the only storage we need)
    private final char[] buf4 = new char[4];
    private int bufPtr = 0; // How many chars in buf4 have been consumed
    private int bufCnt = 0; // How many valid chars are in buf4

    @Override
    public int read(char[] buf, int n) {
        int total = 0;

        while (total < n) {
            // If we have consumed all buffered chars, fetch a new chunk
            if (bufPtr == 0) {
                bufCnt = read4(buf4);
                if (bufCnt == 0) break; // Reached EOF
            }

            // Copy from the buffer to the destination
            while (total < n && bufPtr < bufCnt) {
                buf[total++] = buf4[bufPtr++];
            }

            // If we have read the entire chunk, reset pointer
            if (bufPtr == bufCnt) {
                bufPtr = 0;
            }
        }

        return total;
    }
}
```

#### 4.2 Python

```python
# Python 3.10
class Solution(Reader4):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.buf4 = [0] * 4
        self.ptr = 0
        self.cnt = 0

    def read(self, buf: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        total = 0
        while total < n:
            if self.ptr == 0:
                self.cnt = self.read4(self.buf4)  # read4 writes into self.buf4
            if self.cnt == 0:
                break  # EOF

            while total < n and self.ptr < self.cnt:
                buf.append(self.buf4[self.ptr])
                total += 1
                self.ptr += 1

            if self.ptr == self.cnt:
                self.ptr = 0

        return total
```

> LeetCode’s Python editor passes the `buf` as a *list*, so we `append` into it.

#### 4.3 C++

```cpp
// C++17
class Solution : public Reader4 {
public:
    char buf4[4];
    int bufPtr = 0;
    int bufCnt = 0;

    int read(char *buf, int n) override {
        int total = 0;

        while (total < n) {
            if (bufPtr == 0) {
                bufCnt = read4(buf4);
                if (bufCnt == 0) break; // EOF
            }

            while (total < n && bufPtr < bufCnt) {
                buf[total++] = buf4[bufPtr++];
            }

            if (bufPtr == bufCnt) bufPtr = 0;
        }

        return total;
    }
};
```

### 5. Edge‑Case Checklist

| Edge Case | Why it matters | How the buffer trick handles it |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| **EOF reached mid‑`read`** | `read4` returns fewer than 4, or 0. | We break when `bufCnt == 0`. |
| **`n` is 0** | No read needed. | The outer loop condition immediately fails, returns 0. |
| **Multiple small calls** (`read(1)` then `read(1)` …) | Need to preserve 3 leftover chars after each 4‑char read. | `bufPtr` keeps the state across calls. |
| **Large `n` > file size** | Should read all available chars. | The loop stops when `bufCnt == 0`. |
| **Reset between test cases** | LeetCode creates a new `Solution` object per test case, so instance variables are reset automatically. | No special handling required. |

---

### 6. Complexity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Time** | **O(n)** – each character requested is processed exactly once. |
| **Extra Space** | **O(1)** – only 4 extra chars are stored. |

---

### 7. Why This Problem Rocks in Interviews

1. **Stateful API** – It tests your understanding of *persistent state* across method calls, a common interview pitfall.
2. **Buffering** – Demonstrates ability to think in *sliding windows* and *small fixed buffers* – a pattern that appears in real‑world IO, networking, and streaming problems.
3. **Space vs. Time trade‑offs** – Shows you can meet strict O(1) space while staying linear in time – a classic interview constraint.
4. **Edge‑Case Awareness** – You’ll discuss `EOF`, `n > remaining chars`, and how to gracefully handle them.

---

### 8. Interview Tips

- **Ask clarifying questions**: “Is `read` guaranteed to be called only with a new buffer each time?” “What about resetting state?”  
- **Explain your plan first**: Outline the buffer approach before writing code; interviewers love to see a clear thought process.
- **Discuss complexity**: “My solution reads at most `n` characters, uses only a 4‑char buffer, so time is linear and space is constant.”
- **Mention test cases**: show a quick example (`file = “abcd”`, `read(2) → [ab]`, then `read(3) → [cd]`).

---

### 9. Final Takeaways

| Good | Bad | Ugly |
|------|-----|------|
| **Good** – One‑pass, constant space solution using a persistent 4‑char buffer. | **Bad** – Naïve solutions that discard unread chars break the “multiple calls” rule. | **Ugly** – Forgetting to make `buf4`, `bufPtr`, `bufCnt` instance variables leads to wrong answers on later calls. |

Remember: **Persisted state + careful copy logic = victory**.

### 10. Take Your Interview to the Next Level

- ⭐️ **Show the buffer trick** – it’s the most elegant solution and demonstrates deep understanding of IO state.
- ⭐️ **Discuss complexity** – interviewers expect a clear O(n) time, O(1) space answer for hard problems.
- ⭐️ **Practice edge cases** – try `read(2)` then `read(5)` on a 7‑char file, or `read(4)` then `read(4)` on a 3‑char file.
- ⭐️ **Explain resets** – highlight that LeetCode creates a new `Solution` instance per test case, so instance variables naturally reset.

### 11. Final Words

LeetCode 158 is a classic *stateful IO* problem.  
- The **buffer trick** turns a hard “multiple calls” requirement into a trivial constant‑space solution.  
- Master this pattern and you’ll be ready for a whole family of interview questions involving *streaming*, *buffering*, and *partial reads*.

Good luck – and remember, the *right* solution always looks clean, explains state clearly, and handles every edge case without extra space. Happy coding!
