## OctoPi: Turning a Raspberry Pi into a 3‑D‑Print Server  

The **OctoPi** image is a lightweight Debian‑based distribution that bundles **OctoPrint** with all the drivers needed for a 3‑D printer.  
*Why OctoPi?* It gives a ready‑to‑go firmware layer, a web UI, and a plugin ecosystem that lets you control a printer from anywhere.

### Re‑imaging the Pi

I had to start from a fresh Raspberry Pi SD card:

1. **Download the OctoPi ISO** from the official site (or use a pre‑downloaded `.img` file).  
2. **Flash the image** onto the SD card with the command line:

```bash
sudo rpi-imager --cli /path/to/your/os.img /dev/sdX
```

*The `rpi-imager` CLI is part of the official Raspberry Pi Imager; it automates the write‑to‑disk process, preserving the correct partition layout and bootloader configuration.*

3. **Boot the Pi** and install the OctoPrint plugins you need.  
   *Plugin install times can be long because each one pulls its own dependencies (webhooks, REST APIs, etc.).*

## Automating OS Deployments with a Custom SD‑Card Monitor  

Back when I ran a small **internal site** to manage and deploy OS images, the workflow was:

* **Clone multiple ISO images** into a shared directory.  
* The **server** would detect the insertion of a new SD‑card via a kernel udev rule or a simple volume‑watch script.  
* It would query a **database** (website‑managed) for the card’s intended OS name and ISO file.  
* Finally, it would use the Raspberry Pi Imager (or a similar tool) to flash the disk:

```bash
sudo rpi-imager --cli /path/to/your/os.img /dev/sdX
```

This automated pipeline cut down manual re‑image time and allowed me to keep several old projects running for quick prototyping.

## LeetCode: Refining My Code‑Generation Pipeline  

A temporary block from LeetCode forced me to re‑evaluate my *code‑generation* scripts:

1. **Pre‑test** code locally before submitting to LeetCode.  
2. Updated a **weekly data feed** script that pulls problem metadata and generates Java source files.  
3. Integrated **Lombok** to reduce boilerplate in the generated classes.  
4. Configured **Maven** builds for the new Java test harnesses.  
5. Opened the generated Java files in VS Code, using the built‑in formatter (`Alt+Shift+F`) for a clean code style before publishing.

The result is a smoother development cycle that avoids runtime errors when the code is finally pushed to LeetCode.

## Terrashire: Bringing Terraform‑like Power to the Homelab  

Terrashire is my evolving network‑automation tool, inspired by Terraform. Its goals:

* **Discover** new network devices (e.g., routers, switches) and add them to the data‑center inventory.  
* **Update** dependent services automatically:  
  * **OPNsense** – import router info for network policy synchronization.  
  * **Nginx Proxy Manager** – add reverse‑proxy rules for newly detected services.  
  * **Opnsense** – run `terrashire opnsense init` to register router data for server polling.

By keeping a live map of the homelab, Terrashire reduces manual configuration drift and improves traceability of what each node is doing.

## Takeaway  

Day 16 of my HomeLab journey highlighted three core areas:

1. **OctoPi** – a plug‑and‑play 3‑D‑printing stack on the Raspberry Pi.  
2. **Code‑generation & Lombok** – a cleaner Java build process that speeds up LeetCode submissions.  
3. **Terrashire** – automating network discovery and integration across the homelab stack.

Next steps? Faster SD‑card imaging, a tighter integration of Terrashire with OpnSense, and a more robust Maven‑based Java build for the autogenerated code.

Stay tuned for the next HomeLab log!
