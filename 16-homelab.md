# OctoPi!

Back to the 3D printers and were we left off yesterday.

## No Comrade Left Behind...

We still have a fallen soldier Ender 5 at the moment. One has been happily creating new raspberry pi cases, however the other one will not even center x/y...

- [Configurations](https://github.com/tmosest/tmosest-marlin-configs/blob/main/Ender/Ender/Ender%205/CrealityV422_CR_TOUCH/Configuration.h)

Love being able to have custom boot screens in Marlin... Its cool seeing Ironman for example when I turn on my printer.

Have to reimage a new raspberry pi first and install ocotprint on it though. Installing all of the plugins is taking a while.
This make me wish I still had one of my old projects up and operating that would made it much easier to deal with this.
I had cloned several isos and had an interal site for managing and deploying isos.

It would detect if a new SDK card was inserted into the server and then use the name from the website database configuration to setup the booter.
One way to do this was to have the computer monitor for changes in volumes and then get the name and desired iso from the database.
Then use raspberry pi imager or other similar tools to setup the disk.

`sudo rpi-imager --cli /path/to/your/os.img /dev/sdX` 

# LeetCode 

I have angered the great Coding spirit in the sky and I am now blocked from submitting leetcode problems for a bit...
So it goes this means it is time to upgrade my code generation scripts some and pretest the code in my own environment first.

... That block didn't last very long ... Basically a dog walk...

In that time I updated another script that would take my weekly code data and then update the Java files.

This was a good excuse to add Lombok to my project as well since I needed to update the build flow for the Java file and Java test files that are generated.

I was also able to open the java files in VS code and use hot keys to format them. This is after going and getting the solution and submitting it.

This was still causing some issues though and I would really like to add it to the other flows instead and incorporate a maven build.

# Terrashire

Still trying to make this an actually useful tool. It is starting to know about the network configuration so that way it can poll for a new device to add it to the data center or homelab. Ideally this should update the other services such as opnsense, nginx proxy manager, etc.

That way it is easier to manage and track what is doing what within a homelab environment. Now when `terrashire opnsense init` is run it will add the information about the router to the servers for polling as well.
