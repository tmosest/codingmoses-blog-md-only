        ## 1.  Problem & Solution Overview  

**LeetCode 1619 – Mean of Array After Removing Some Elements**  
> *Given an integer array `arr`, return the mean of the remaining integers after removing the smallest 5 % and the largest 5 % of the elements.*

The array length is always a multiple of 20, so the “5 %” is always an integer.  
The required answer must be accurate to within `10⁻⁵`.  

Below you’ll find three fully‑working, idiomatic solutions – **Java**, **Python**, and **C++** – all following the same simple O(n log n) sorting strategy.  After that, read the accompanying blog post that dives into the algorithmic “good, the bad, and the ugly,” and shows you how to talk about it in a technical interview.

## 2.  Code

### 2.1 Java (beats 100 %)

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public double trimMean(int[] arr) {
        // 5% of the array size – guaranteed to be an integer
        int k = arr.length / 20;            // 5% of 20 = 1, 5% of 40 = 2, etc.
        Arrays.sort(arr);                   // O(n log n)

        long sum = 0;                       // use long to avoid overflow
        for (int i = k; i < arr.length - k; ++i) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }
        return (double) sum / (arr.length - 2 * k);
    }
}
```

**Key points**

* `Arrays.sort` – built‑in quick‑sort (dual‑pivot) – O(n log n)  
* `k = arr.length / 20` because the length is always a multiple of 20  
* Accumulate in `long` to be safe with up to 1000 × 10⁵ = 10⁸ (fits in 64‑bit)  
* Return a `double` – automatically casts `long` → `double`

---

### 2.2 Python (fast, easy, Pythonic)

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def trimMean(self, arr: List[int]) -> float:
        k = len(arr) // 20          # 5% of the length
        arr.sort()                  # in‑place sort, O(n log n)
        trimmed = arr[k:-k]         # slice removes first k and last k
        return sum(trimmed) / len(trimmed)
```

**Why this works**

* Python’s `list.sort()` uses Timsort – O(n log n) but often linear for nearly‑sorted data.  
* `trimmed = arr[k:-k]` slices off the extremes in O(1) time (just creates a new view).  
* `sum()` and `len()` are both O(m), where m = len(trimmed) = len(arr) − 2k.  

---

### 2.3 C++ (modern, efficient)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    double trimMean(vector<int>& arr) {
        int k = arr.size() / 20;        // 5% of the array size
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());   // std::sort, O(n log n)

        long long sum = 0;
        for (int i = k; i < (int)arr.size() - k; ++i)
            sum += arr[i];

        return static_cast<double>(sum) / (arr.size() - 2 * k);
    }
};
```

**Notes**

* `std::sort` uses introsort – a hybrid of quick‑sort, heapsort, and insertion sort – O(n log n).  
* `long long` (64‑bit) avoids overflow for the given constraints.  
* `static_cast<double>` ensures a floating‑point division.

### 3.1 Introduction  

In the world of coding interviews, *LeetCode 1619 – Mean of Array After Removing Some Elements* is a surprisingly frequent “nice‑to‑know” question.  It tests a candidate’s grasp of **array manipulation**, **percentile filtering**, and **floating‑point precision** while still fitting inside a short, 5‑minute coding session.  

> **Why this problem matters:**  
> * It forces you to think about **integer division** vs **floating‑point division**.  
> * It illustrates the importance of **off‑by‑one errors** when trimming extremes.  
> * It gives you a clean opportunity to talk about *time* and *space* complexity – essential interview talking points.

---

### 3.2 Problem Restatement  

> **Input:** An integer array `arr` (20 ≤ `arr.length` ≤ 1000, always a multiple of 20).  
> **Output:** The mean of the remaining elements after discarding the smallest 5 % and the largest 5 %.  

The constraints guarantee that the number of removed elements is an integer: `k = arr.length / 20`.  

---

### 3.3 The “Good” – Simple, Correct, Efficient  

1. **Sorting is the obvious choice**.  
   * Because we need to remove the absolute *smallest* and *largest* elements, sorting guarantees that the first `k` and the last `k` entries are exactly those to drop.  
   * Complexity: O(n log n). With `n ≤ 1000`, this is more than fast enough.  

2. **Precision is easy to handle**.  
   * Sum the remaining integers as a 64‑bit integer (`long long` in C++, `long` in Java).  
   * Convert to `double` only when computing the mean.  

3. **Clarity of code**.  
   * The solution is a single function: sort → slice → sum → divide.  
   * No hidden tricks, no edge‑case surprises.

### 3.4 The “Bad” – Things That Go Wrong

| Pitfall | Why it fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Using `int` for the sum** | Sum can be up to `1000 * 10⁵ = 10⁸`, which still fits in 32‑bit, but it’s safer to use 64‑bit, especially in languages with 32‑bit int by default (e.g., C). | Use `long long` / `long`. |
| **Off‑by‑one in slicing** | Forgetting that the slice is inclusive of the lower bound but exclusive of the upper bound. | Verify `k` and `n-k` indices carefully. |
| **Floating‑point division before truncation** | `sum / (n - 2k)` where both operands are integers → integer division → zero. | Cast to `double` before dividing. |
| **Assuming array is already sorted** | Some candidates will try to skip sorting; but then they’d be removing arbitrary `k` elements. | Explicitly sort first. |
| **Ignoring the “5 %” guarantee** | If you compute `k = int(n * 0.05)` without `floor`, rounding errors can lead to `k` being wrong when `n` is not a perfect multiple of 20. | Use integer division `n / 20`. |

---

### 3.5 The “Ugly” – Over‑engineering

* **Quickselect** – An O(n) selection algorithm can find the kth smallest/largest element without fully sorting.  
  * *Why it’s ugly*: It’s overkill for `n ≤ 1000` and introduces complexity (partitioning logic, recursion).  
  * *When to use it*: Only when you have huge arrays (millions of elements) and strict time limits.  
* **Counting sort / Bucket sort** – Since `arr[i] ≤ 10⁵`, you could use a frequency array.  
  * *Why it’s ugly*: It takes O(max value) space (~10⁵) – wasteful when `n` is tiny.  
  * *When it shines*: When the value range is narrow (e.g., 0–255).  
* **Median‑of‑medians** – A deterministic O(n) selection for the exact percentile.  
  * *Why it’s ugly*: Extremely verbose and hard to implement correctly in an interview.

> **Bottom line:** Keep it simple.  Sort → slice → average.  If you’re a seasoned C++/Java programmer, you’ll be comfortable with a few lines of code.  If you’re a Python developer, the list’s built‑in sort and slicing shine.

### 3.6 Interview‑Friendly Discussion

1. **Explain the approach** – “I’ll sort the array; the first and last 5 % are guaranteed to be the extremes, so I’ll sum the middle section.”  
2. **Talk about complexity** – “Sorting is O(n log n), which is fine for up to 1000 elements.”  
3. **Mention precision** – “I’ll accumulate in a 64‑bit integer to avoid overflow, then cast to double for the mean.”  
4. **Show a quick test case** – “If the array is all 2’s except a few 1’s and 3’s, the mean will be 2.0 after trimming.”  
5. **Optional optimization** – “If you’re concerned about time, you could use a quickselect to find the kth smallest and kth largest and then iterate to sum the middle elements.  But for this constraint, sorting is simplest.”
