## Problem Recap <a name="problem-recap"></a>

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `inventory[i]` | Number of balls of color *i* (initial value). |
| `orders` | Total number of balls the customer wants to buy. |
| Value of a ball | Current count of that color in your inventory. After selling a ball, the count decreases by 1. |
| Goal | Maximise total revenue, modulo `1 000 000 007`. |

**Constraints**

* `1 ≤ inventory.length ≤ 10⁵`
* `1 ≤ inventory[i] ≤ 10⁹`
* `1 ≤ orders ≤ min(Σ inventory[i], 10⁹)`

---

## Intuition & Greedy Insight <a name="intuition"></a>

Think of each color as a *tower* of balls.  
If you always sell from the **tallest tower** you collect the highest immediate price.  
Because the price drops by 1 after every sale, the *sequence* of prices from a tower is strictly decreasing.

**Greedy Claim**  
At every step it’s optimal to pick the ball with the current highest value.  
Proof sketch: exchanging a lower‑value ball with a higher one can’t reduce total revenue because all other values stay unchanged.

The challenge is to **simulate this greedy process in O(n log n)** instead of literally selling one ball at a time (which could be `10⁹` operations).

---

## Two Approaches <a name="approaches"></a>

### 1. Sorting + “Layer” Trick (O(n log n))

1. **Sort** `inventory` in ascending order.  
2. Scan from the largest value downwards.  
3. For each “layer” (interval of equal values) compute:
   * `cnt` – how many colors are at least as tall as the current layer.  
   * `next` – the value just below the current layer.  
   * `totalInLayer = (curVal – next) * cnt` – number of balls that would be sold if we drained all colors to the next level.  
4. If `orders` are enough to consume the whole layer, add the arithmetic sum:
   ```
   sum = cnt * (curVal + next + 1) * (curVal - next) / 2
   ```
   else only drain part of the layer:
   * `h = orders // cnt` – full height we can lower each of the `cnt` colors.  
   * `rem = orders % cnt` – leftover balls that stay at the same height.  
   * Add the sum for the full drop (`curVal … curVal-h+1`) and the partial drop (`rem * (curVal-h)`).

5. Modulo after every addition.

This idea is equivalent to “slicing the towers like a cake” – you can skip whole groups of identical drops.

### 2. Max‑Heap (O(m log n))

*Build a priority queue with all distinct inventory values (tallest on top).  
*Keep a counter map of how many colors share a particular height.  
*While `orders` > 0:
  * Grab the top height `cur`.  
  * Let `cnt` be how many colors have this height.  
  * Let `next` be the next lower height (peek at heap).  
  * `drop = min(cur - next, orders / cnt)` – how many levels we can safely reduce for all `cnt` towers.  
  * Compute the revenue in the same arithmetic‑sum way as above.  
  * Update `orders`, `cnt`, the map and heap accordingly.

This is simpler to code for interviewers who want a *priority‑queue* demo, but in worst case it can be `O(m log n)` (≈ `10⁹ log 10⁵`), so usually the sorted approach is the “preferred” one.

## Reference Code <a name="code"></a>

Below are clean, well‑commented implementations that use the **sorting + layer trick**.  
All three languages share the same logic; only syntax differs.

### Java 17 <a name="java-code"></a>
```java
import java.util.*;
import static java.util.stream.IntStream.*;

class Solution {
    private static final long MOD = 1_000_000_007L;

    public int maxProfit(int[] inventory, int orders) {
        Arrays.sort(inventory);          // ascending
        int n = inventory.length;
        long revenue = 0L;
        int idx = n - 1;                 // start from largest
        long cur = inventory[idx];

        while (orders > 0) {
            // move idx left while we stay in the same layer
            while (idx >= 0 && cur == inventory[idx]) idx--;
            long cnt = n - idx - 1;          // colors at least cur
            long next = (idx >= 0) ? inventory[idx] : 0; // value just below layer

            long ballsInLayer = (cur - next) * cnt;       // how many if we fully drain

            if (orders >= ballsInLayer) {                 // take whole layer
                revenue += arithmeticSum(cur, next + 1, cnt);
                orders -= ballsInLayer;
            } else {                                     // partial layer
                long h = orders / cnt;        // full height we can lower
                long r = orders % cnt;        // remainder

                revenue += arithmeticSum(cur, cur - h + 1, cnt);
                revenue += r * (cur - h);     // remaining balls at the current height

                orders = 0;
            }
            revenue %= MOD;
            cur = next;                     // descend to next layer
        }
        return (int) revenue;
    }

    // arithmetic series: sum of integers from a down to b (inclusive), multiplied by cnt
    private long arithmeticSum(long a, long b, long cnt) {
        return cnt * (a + b) * (a - b + 1) / 2;
    }
}
```

### Python 3 <a name="python-code"></a>
```python
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, inventory: list[int], orders: int) -> int:
        inventory.sort()                     # ascending
        n = len(inventory)
        revenue = 0
        idx = n - 1
        cur = inventory[idx]

        while orders:
            while idx >= 0 and cur == inventory[idx]:
                idx -= 1
            cnt = n - idx - 1
            nxt = inventory[idx] if idx >= 0 else 0
            total = (cur - nxt) * cnt

            if orders >= total:  # drain the whole layer
                revenue += self._arithmetic_sum(cur, nxt + 1, cnt)
                orders -= total
            else:                # partial layer
                h = orders // cnt
                r = orders % cnt
                revenue += self._arithmetic_sum(cur, cur - h + 1, cnt)
                revenue += r * (cur - h)
                orders = 0

            revenue %= MOD
            cur = nxt

        return int(revenue)

    @staticmethod
    def _arithmetic_sum(max_val: int, min_val: int, cnt: int) -> int:
        # sum_{x=min}^{max} x = (max+min)*(max-min+1)/2
        return cnt * (max_val + min_val) * (max_val - min_val + 1) // 2
```

### C++17 <a name="cxx-code"></a>
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
    static constexpr long long MOD = 1'000'000'007LL;

public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& inventory, int orders) {
        sort(inventory.begin(), inventory.end());          // ascending
        long long rev = 0;
        int n = inventory.size();
        int idx = n - 1;
        long long cur = inventory[idx];

        while (orders) {
            while (idx >= 0 && cur == inventory[idx]) --idx;
            long long cnt = n - idx - 1;                   // towers in this layer
            long long nxt = (idx >= 0) ? inventory[idx] : 0;
            long long layerSize = (cur - nxt) * cnt;

            if (orders >= layerSize) {
                rev += arithmeticSum(cur, nxt + 1, cnt);
                orders -= layerSize;
            } else {
                long long h = orders / cnt;
                long long r = orders % cnt;
                rev += arithmeticSum(cur, cur - h + 1, cnt);
                rev += r * (cur - h);
                orders = 0;
            }
            rev %= MOD;
            cur = nxt;
        }
        return static_cast<int>(rev);
    }

private:
    static long long arithmeticSum(long long maxVal, long long minVal, long long cnt) {
        // sum_{x=min}^{max} x = (max+min)*(max-min+1)/2
        return cnt * (maxVal + minVal) * (maxVal - minVal + 1) / 2;
    }
};
```

### Problem Statement (Re‑framed)

- You have **`n` colors** of balls; each color `i` has `inventory[i]` balls.
- A customer will **buy `orders` balls**.
- The **price** of each ball is the **current count** of its color.
- **Goal**: Maximise revenue modulo `1 000 000 007`.

---

### The Greedy Insight

> **Always pick the ball with the highest current value.**

1. A higher value gives more revenue right now.
2. Lower values cannot compensate for that lost revenue because the *other* towers stay unchanged.
3. Exchanging a low‑value sale with a high‑value one always improves or keeps the revenue the same.

---

### Efficient Slicing: The Layer Trick

1. **Sort** the inventory array in ascending order (`O(n log n)`).
2. Scan from the largest value downwards.  
   - Each “layer” consists of one or more colors that share the same height.
3. **Drop whole layers** at once by using the arithmetic‑series formula.  
4. If `orders` are insufficient to drain the entire layer, **drop partially**:
   - Compute how many full levels can be dropped for all towers (`h = orders // count`).
   - Compute the remainder at the new level.

This slicing strategy eliminates the need to simulate each ball drop individually, giving us the desired `O(n log n)` runtime.

---

### Mathematical Core – Arithmetic Sum

> To compute the revenue of dropping a tower from height `A` to `B` (inclusive) we use:
> \[
> \text{sum} = (A + B) \times (A - B + 1) / 2
> \]
> Multiply by the number of towers sharing the drop (`cnt`) to get total revenue for that slice.

---

### Handling the Modulo

- **Why modulo?**  
  All LeetCode problems with a “modulo” requirement force you to keep values bounded; otherwise, you risk overflow.
- **How we keep it safe?**  
  After every major addition, we take `revenue %= MOD`.  
  The intermediate calculations use 64‑bit integers (`long long` in C++, `long` in Java, Python’s arbitrary precision).

### Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Using `int` for intermediate sums** | Overflow when `inventory` ≈ 10⁹ and `cnt` ≈ 10⁵. Use 64‑bit (`long long`/`long`). |
| **Neglecting the modulo after each addition** | Can produce negative values or overflow. |
| **Dropping too many levels in partial layer** | Must compute `h = orders // cnt`, not `h = cur - nxt`. |
| **Mis‑indexing in sorted array** | Carefully move `idx` left until height changes. |

---

### Complexity Breakdown

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`
- **Scanning**: each element examined once → `O(n)`
- **Memory**: only a few variables → `O(1)` (ignoring the input array).

> **Result**: Fits comfortably within the LeetCode time‑limit and works for the largest input constraints.

---

### Final Takeaway

> Problem 1648 is a **greedy + arithmetic‑series** combo.  
> The sorted‑layer solution is efficient, elegant, and demonstrates strong algorithmic thinking.  
> Mastering it will impress any technical recruiter and give you a powerful pattern for future questions involving **height‑based pricing** or **cumulative reductions**.

### FAQs

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Can we use the priority queue approach?** | Yes, but it's slower in worst case. Use it only if time is not tight. |
| **What if `orders` is larger than total inventory?** | Problem guarantees `orders <= sum(inventory)` – otherwise revenue would be zero. |
| **Why not use a Fenwick tree?** | Sorting + scanning is simpler and uses O(1) memory, which is sufficient. |
