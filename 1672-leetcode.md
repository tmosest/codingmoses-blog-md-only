        ## 🚀 Richest Customer Wealth – LeetCode 1672  
### The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (with Java, Python & C++ solutions)

---

### Problem Recap

> **LeetCode 1672 – Richest Customer Wealth**  
> Given an `m × n` integer matrix `accounts` where `accounts[i][j]` represents the amount of money customer *i* has in bank *j*, find the **maximum wealth** among all customers.  
> A customer’s wealth = sum of all bank balances for that customer.

| Constraints | 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 50 | 1 ≤ accounts[i][j] ≤ 100 |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------|

> **Return** the wealth of the richest customer.

---

## 1️⃣ Algorithm Overview (The “Good”)

The task is straightforward:

1. **Iterate over each customer** (row of `accounts`).
2. **Sum** all balances in that row – that is the customer's total wealth.
3. Keep a running maximum of these sums.
4. Return the maximum after all rows are processed.

Because we only scan the matrix once, the algorithm runs in **O(m × n)** time and uses **O(1)** extra space.

---

## 2️⃣ “Bad” – Where Things Go Wrong

| Potential Pitfall | Why it fails | Fix |
|-------------------|--------------|-----|
| **Using `int` overflow** | Max possible sum = 50 × 100 = 5000 – fits in `int`, but novices might use `long` unnecessarily. | `int` is fine; keep an eye on language limits if constraints grow. |
| **Not handling empty rows** | LeetCode guarantees at least one customer & bank, but defensive coding helps. | Add checks or rely on the problem guarantees. |
| **Mis‑reading the matrix orientation** | Accidentally summing columns instead of rows leads to wrong answer. | Explicitly iterate `for (int[] customer : accounts)` in Java, `for (row in accounts)` in Python, etc. |

---

## 3️⃣ “Ugly” – Over‑Engineered or Unnecessary

- **Functional‑style, lambda‑heavy code** (e.g., `sum(map(sum, accounts))`) may hide the core logic.
- **Using heavy libraries** (`numpy`, `streams`, etc.) where a simple loop suffices.
- **Excessive comments** that clutter readability.
- **Hard‑coding values** instead of dynamic loops.

The clean, imperative style is the best way to shine in interviews.

## 4️⃣ Code Implementations

### 📜 Java (LeetCode Signature)

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maximumWealth(int[][] accounts) {
        int maxWealth = 0;
        for (int[] customer : accounts) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int money : customer) {
                sum += money;
            }
            maxWealth = Math.max(maxWealth, sum);
        }
        return maxWealth;
    }
}
```

> **Complexity**:  
> - Time: `O(m * n)`  
> - Space: `O(1)`

---

### 📜 Python (LeetCode Signature)

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumWealth(self, accounts: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        max_wealth = 0
        for customer in accounts:
            wealth = sum(customer)
            max_wealth = max(max_wealth, wealth)
        return max_wealth
```

> **Complexity**:  
> - Time: `O(m * n)`  
> - Space: `O(1)` (the built‑in `sum` is linear but uses constant extra memory)

---

### 📜 C++ (LeetCode Signature)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumWealth(vector<vector<int>>& accounts) {
        int maxWealth = 0;
        for (const auto& customer : accounts) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int money : customer) sum += money;
            maxWealth = max(maxWealth, sum);
        }
        return maxWealth;
    }
};
```

> **Complexity**:  
> - Time: `O(m * n)`  
> - Space: `O(1)`

---

## 5️⃣ Testing the Solutions

| Input | Expected Output |
|-------|-----------------|
| `[[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]` | `6` |
| `[[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]` | `10` |
| `[[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]` | `17` |

Run the above tests on each implementation; all should return the expected value instantly.
