# Home Wiring Failure

...

Kinda a day wasted. Printer was down and didnt want to work.
Fixing it wasn't my priority... Instead, I wanted to run ethernet cables throughout my walls.
But my labrador felt ignored and needed me to take some time off.

Please needed to catch up on my sleep debt a little.
