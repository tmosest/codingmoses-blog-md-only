## 📌 Problem Recap  

> **Given**  
> *   `nums[0 … n-1]` – an integer array (1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵)  
> *   `multipliers[0 … m-1]` – an integer array (1 ≤ m ≤ 300, and **m ≤ n**)  

> **Action** – Perform **exactly `m` operations**.  
> In the *i‑th* operation you may **remove** either the **leftmost** or the **rightmost** element from `nums`.  
> The removed element is multiplied by `multipliers[i]` and added to your total score.  

> **Goal** – Maximize the total score after all `m` operations.

### 🔍 Why This Problem is a *Must‑Know* Interview Question  

| Reason | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Choice DP** | Demonstrates *how to decide between two future states* – a core interview theme. |
| **Greedy + DP** | You might be tempted to take a greedy approach; showing you know **when greedy fails** is impressive. |
| **Large `n`** | The trick of trimming the array to the first and last `m` elements shows you can reason about *reachability* and *space‑saving*. |
| **Constraints** | With `m ≤ 300`, an `O(m³)` brute force is infeasible – proves you can design an *efficient* solution. |
| **Negative Numbers** | Must handle negative products correctly – not just `max()` on positives. |

> **Job Interview Hack:** If you can nail this question in a 45‑minute slot, you’ll get the “DP” badge on your résumé – a coveted keyword for many tech recruiters.

## 🛠️ The Good – The Clear, Intuitive DP Approach  

1. **State Definition**  
   - `dp[l][k]` – the maximum score we can obtain **after we have already taken `k` elements from the left** of the trimmed array and are currently at operation `k`.  
   - The number of elements taken from the right is `k - l`.  
   - The index of the rightmost usable element in the original array is  
     `right = n - 1 - (k - l)`.

2. **Transition**  
   - Take from the left: `nums[l] * multipliers[k] + dp[l+1][k+1]`.  
   - Take from the right: `nums[right] * multipliers[k] + dp[l][k+1]`.  
   - Choose the maximum.

3. **Base Case**  
   - When `k == m`, all multipliers are used → score `0`.

4. **Optimization**  
   - Only the first `m` and the last `m` elements of `nums` can ever be chosen.  
   - If `n > 2*m`, we can safely *trim* `nums` to a new array of size `2*m`.  
   - This reduces the DP table size to at most `m × m` (≈ 90 000 entries when `m = 300`).

The algorithm runs in `O(m²)` time and `O(m²)` memory – perfectly fine for the constraints.

---

## ❌ The Bad – What Happens If You Don’t Use DP?  

A straight‑forward recursive implementation that tries all left/right choices will produce **exponential time** (`O(2^m)`).  
With `m = 300`, that’s astronomically huge – you’ll hit **Time‑Limit Exceeded** in 0.01 s.  

Even a memoised recursion that does **not** trim the array still uses `O(n²)` memory when `n` is large, which will blow up to > 2 GB.  
That’s why the *naive* solution is a **dead end**.

---

## 😱 The Ugly – Edge Cases & Common Pitfalls  

| Pitfall | Explanation | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Negative Products** | Multipliers and `nums` can be negative. A simple “take the larger absolute value” heuristic fails. | Use the full DP comparison (`max(left, right)`). |
| **Overflow** | Max score ≈ `1000 * 1000 * 300 = 300 000 000` – fits in `int`, but adding many operations can exceed 32‑bit in some languages. | Use `long long` (C++/Java) or `int64` (Python’s `int` is unbounded). |
| **Large `n`** | `n` can be 10⁵, but you only need `2*m` elements. | Trim the array first; otherwise you allocate `n × n` DP table. |
| **Recursive Stack Overflow** | Recursive depth `m ≤ 300` is safe in most runtimes, but in strict environments you might hit stack limits. | Provide an iterative (bottom‑up) implementation or use `@lru_cache` in Python. |
| **Wrong Index Calculations** | Off‑by‑one errors when computing the right index `n - 1 - (k - l)` are common. | Keep a clear invariant: `l` always points to the next unused left element. |
| **Memory Explosion** | `dp` size `m × m` is fine, but `dp` of size `n × n` is not. | Trim `nums` to `2*m` first. |

## 🧩 Solution Walk‑Through  

1. **Trim the array**  
   ```text
   if n > 2*m:
       nums = nums[:m] + nums[-m:]
   ```
   Now `len(nums) == 2*m`.

2. **DP table**  
   `dp[l][k]` – best score after using `k` multipliers and already removed `l` elements from the left.  
   The right side removed count is `k - l`.

3. **Recurrence**  
   ```text
   left  = nums[l] * multipliers[k] + dp[l+1][k+1]
   right = nums[right_index] * multipliers[k] + dp[l][k+1]
   dp[l][k] = max(left, right)
   ```

4. **Base** – `k == m` → 0.

5. **Answer** – `dp[0][0]`.

## 🖥️ Code Snippets  

> All three solutions use **memoised DP** (top‑down).  
> Time complexity: **O(m²)**, Memory: **O(m²)**.  
> `m ≤ 300`, so the DP table is at most 90 000 entries.

### Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    /* 1. Keep a reference to the trimmed array  */
    private int[] nums;
    private int[] multipliers;
    private int m, n;                 // n == nums.length, m == multipliers.length
    private long[][] memo;            // long to avoid overflow

    public int maximumScore(int[] nums, int[] multipliers) {
        this.multipliers = multipliers;
        this.m = multipliers.length;
        /* Trim only the needed part of nums */
        if (nums.length > 2 * m) {
            int[] trimmed = new int[2 * m];
            System.arraycopy(nums, 0, trimmed, 0, m);
            System.arraycopy(nums, nums.length - m, trimmed, m, m);
            this.nums = trimmed;
        } else {
            this.nums = nums;
        }
        this.n = this.nums.length;
        memo = new long[m][m];   // indices: left, taken
        for (long[] row : memo) Arrays.fill(row, Long.MIN_VALUE);
        return (int) dfs(0, 0);   // start from left=0, used multipliers=0
    }

    /* dp(left, k) → best score after using k multipliers and having removed left elements from the left side */
    private long dfs(int left, int k) {
        if (k == m) return 0;
        if (memo[left][k] != Long.MIN_VALUE) return memo[left][k];
        int right = n - 1 - (k - left);          // corresponding right index

        long takeLeft  = (long) nums[left] * multipliers[k] + dfs(left + 1, k + 1);
        long takeRight = (long) nums[right] * multipliers[k] + dfs(left, k + 1);

        return memo[left][k] = Math.max(takeLeft, takeRight);
    }
}
```

> **Why `long`?**  
> Even though `int` fits the limits, using `long` guarantees safety if the constraints are relaxed.

### Python

```python
from functools import lru_cache

class Solution:
    def maximumScore(self, nums, multipliers):
        m = len(multipliers)

        # Only the first m and last m elements can be used
        if len(nums) > 2 * m:
            nums = nums[:m] + nums[-m:]

        n = len(nums)

        @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
        def dfs(left, k):
            """left – how many left elements already taken
               k   – how many multipliers already used"""
            if k == m:
                return 0
            right = n - 1 - (k - left)        # index of the current right element
            take_left  = nums[left] * multipliers[k] + dfs(left + 1, k + 1)
            take_right = nums[right] * multipliers[k] + dfs(left, k + 1)
            return max(take_left, take_right)

        return dfs(0, 0)
```

> **`lru_cache`** replaces the manual DP table, keeping the recursion stack minimal.

### C++ (Top‑Down with Memoisation)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumScore(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& multipliers) {
        int m = multipliers.size();

        /* Trim the array to 2*m if needed */
        if ((int)nums.size() > 2 * m) {
            vector<int> trimmed(2 * m);
            copy(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + m, trimmed.begin());
            copy(nums.end() - m, nums.end(), trimmed.begin() + m);
            nums.swap(trimmed);
        }
        int n = nums.size();

        vector<vector<long long>> memo(m, vector<long long>(m, LLONG_MIN));

        function<long long(int,int)> dfs = [&](int left, int k) -> long long {
            if (k == m) return 0;
            if (memo[left][k] != LLONG_MIN) return memo[left][k];
            int right = n - 1 - (k - left);
            long long takeLeft  = 1LL * nums[left] * multipliers[k] + dfs(left + 1, k + 1);
            long long takeRight = 1LL * nums[right] * multipliers[k] + dfs(left, k + 1);
            return memo[left][k] = max(takeLeft, takeRight);
        };
        return (int)dfs(0, 0);
    }
};
```

> The lambda `dfs` captures `nums` and `multipliers` by reference, keeping the code concise.
