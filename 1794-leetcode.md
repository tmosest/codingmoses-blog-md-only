### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Overview

> **LeetCode 1794**  
> *Medium*  

You‚Äôre given two strings `firstString` and `secondString` (both only lowercase letters).  
Count all index quadruples `(i, j, a, b)` that satisfy:

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `0 ‚â§ i ‚â§ j < firstString.length` | Substring in `firstString` |
| `0 ‚â§ a ‚â§ b < secondString.length` | Substring in `secondString` |
| `firstString[i ‚Ä¶ j] == secondString[a ‚Ä¶ b]` | Equal substrings |
| `j - a` is **minimal** among all quadruples that satisfy the above | We only care about the smallest possible difference |

Return the number of quadruples that achieve this minimal `j - a`.

> **Why is this interesting?**  
> At first glance it looks like a classic ‚Äúequal substring‚Äù problem that could explode combinatorially.  
> The twist: the answer never needs a substring longer than one character!

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The ‚ÄúGood‚ÄëBad‚ÄëUgly‚Äù Analysis

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Observations** | 1‚Äëchar substrings suffice ‚Üí linear time. | Misinterpreting ‚Äúminimal difference‚Äù as ‚Äúshortest length‚Äù. | Forgetting that `j - a` can be negative; ignoring the sign. |
| **Algorithm** | Store earliest occurrence of each letter in `firstString`. Iterate `secondString` from end, computing `diff = firstIdx[char] - i`. | A na√Øve double loop ‚Üí `O(n¬≤)` or using suffix arrays ‚Üí overkill. | Edge‚Äëcases: repeated characters, no common letter ‚Üí return `0`. |
| **Complexity** | `O(n + m)` time, `O(26)` space. | `O(n¬≤)` would time‚Äëout on `2¬∑10‚Åµ`. | Handling huge strings without overflow (use `int`; difference fits in `int`). |
| **Code** | Clear, concise, no extra data structures. | Too many nested loops ‚Üí readability suffers. | Uninitialized map entries ‚Üí NullPointerException in Java; off‚Äëby‚Äëone errors in C++ loops. |
| **SEO** | Uses popular keywords (‚ÄúLeetCode‚Äù, ‚Äúinterview‚Äù, ‚Äústring‚Äù, ‚ÄúJava‚Äù, ‚ÄúPython‚Äù, ‚ÄúC++‚Äù). | Poor SEO: no tags, no keyword density. | Over‚Äëoptimizing for SEO can hurt readability. |

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Elegant Solution

The key insight:  
**If two substrings are equal, you can always shrink them to a single matching character without increasing `j - a`.**  
Hence the minimal `j - a` is simply the smallest difference between an index in `firstString` and an index in `secondString` for a common character.  
Count how many pairs achieve that difference.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ 3‚ÄëLanguage Implementations

> All solutions run in **O(n + m)** time and **O(1)** space (only 26‚Äësize arrays).

---

### 4.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int countQuadruples(String firstString, String secondString) {
        // Map each char to its first occurrence in firstString
        int[] firstIdx = new int[26];
        Arrays.fill(firstIdx, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < firstString.length(); i++) {
            int c = firstString.charAt(i) - 'a';
            if (firstIdx[c] == -1) firstIdx[c] = i;   // store earliest
        }

        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int answer = 0;

        // Scan secondString from end to the beginning
        for (int i = secondString.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int c = secondString.charAt(i) - 'a';
            if (firstIdx[c] == -1) continue;          // char not in firstString

            int diff = firstIdx[c] - i;               // j - a with j=i, b=i
            if (diff < minDiff) {
                minDiff = diff;
                answer = 1;
            } else if (diff == minDiff) {
                answer++;
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```

**Explanation**  
- `firstIdx` stores the *earliest* index of each letter.  
- While iterating `secondString` from back to front, we guarantee that `i` is the *latest* possible `a` for that letter, which together with the earliest `i` from `firstString` gives the minimal `j - a`.  
- We keep the global `minDiff` and count how many times it occurs.

### 4.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def countQuadruples(self, firstString: str, secondString: str) -> int:
        first_idx = [-1] * 26
        for i, ch in enumerate(firstString):
            idx = ord(ch) - 97
            if first_idx[idx] == -1:
                first_idx[idx] = i            # first (smallest) occurrence

        min_diff = float('inf')
        count = 0

        # iterate secondString from end to start
        for i in range(len(secondString) - 1, -1, -1):
            idx = ord(secondString[i]) - 97
            if first_idx[idx] == -1:
                continue                      # char not in firstString

            diff = first_idx[idx] - i         # j-a with j=i, b=i
            if diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = diff
                count = 1
            elif diff == min_diff:
                count += 1

        return count
```

**Pythonic Highlights**  
- Uses a simple list of size 26 instead of a dict for speed.  
- `range(len(secondString) - 1, -1, -1)` gives a reverse loop.

### 4.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countQuadruples(string firstString, string secondString) {
        vector<int> firstIdx(26, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)firstString.size(); ++i) {
            int c = firstString[i] - 'a';
            if (firstIdx[c] == -1) firstIdx[c] = i;   // store earliest
        }

        int minDiff = INT_MAX;
        int answer = 0;

        for (int i = (int)secondString.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            int c = secondString[i] - 'a';
            if (firstIdx[c] == -1) continue;           // char not in firstString
            int diff = firstIdx[c] - i;                // j - a
            if (diff < minDiff) {
                minDiff = diff;
                answer = 1;
            } else if (diff == minDiff) {
                ++answer;
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
};
```

**Why C++ works**  
- `vector<int>` of size 26 gives O(1) lookups.  
- No dynamic memory beyond the two strings ‚Äì perfect for interview constraints.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | Why it Happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| Using `HashMap<Character,Integer>` in Java and accessing a missing key ‚Üí `NullPointerException` | Forgetting to check existence | Use `containsKey()` or an array of size 26 |
| Starting `minDiff` at `0` | The minimal difference can be negative | Initialize with `Integer.MAX_VALUE` / `INT_MAX` |
| Counting quadruples incorrectly when `j-a` is negative | Confusion between sign and magnitude | Treat `diff = firstIdx - i` directly |
| Ignoring that repeated characters may produce *multiple* minimal pairs | Assumed only one pair per character | Loop over all indices of `secondString` (reverse) to catch all |
| Using O(n¬≤) substring comparisons | Over‚Äëengineering | Realize 1‚Äëchar substrings suffice |
