## üìå Problem Statement (LeetCode‚ÄØ1798)

> **Maximum Number of Consecutive Values You Can Make**  
> You are given an integer array `coins`.  
> You can make a value `x` if you can pick a subset of the coins whose sum equals `x`.  
> **Return the maximum number of consecutive integer values that you can make starting from 0**.  

**Constraints**

| | |
|---|---|
| `coins.length` | 1 ‚Ä¶ 4‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚Å¥ |
| `coins[i]` | 1 ‚Ä¶ 4‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚Å¥ |

**Example**

```text
coins = [1,1,1,4]   ‚Üí   answer = 8
```

---

## üîç Intuition

If you can make all values `0 ‚Ä¶ k` (inclusive), then any coin `c ‚â§ k+1` can be added to produce all values `0 ‚Ä¶ k+c`.  
If a coin is larger than `k+1`, you will have a ‚Äúgap‚Äù that can‚Äôt be bridged ‚Äì you‚Äôre stuck.  

So the greedy strategy is:

1. **Sort** the coins ascending.
2. Maintain `reach = 1` (you can already make all values `< reach`).
3. For each coin `c`:
   * If `c > reach`, stop ‚Äì you can‚Äôt cover `reach`.
   * Otherwise, `reach += c` ‚Äì you can now make all values `< reach` again.

Finally, `reach` is the first value you *cannot* make, hence the answer is `reach`.

This greedy algorithm is optimal because you always use the smallest possible coin to extend the range.

## üíª Code Implementations

### 1. Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int getMaximumConsecutive(int[] coins) {
        // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sort the coins
        Arrays.sort(coins);

        // 2Ô∏è‚É£ start with reach = 1 (all values < 1 can be made, i.e. 0)
        int reach = 1;

        // 3Ô∏è‚É£ iterate
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (coin > reach) break;   // gap found
            reach += coin;             // extend the reachable range
        }
        return reach;                  // first value you cannot make
    }
}
```

**Complexity**

| | Time | Space |
|---|---|---|
| Sorting | `O(n log n)` | `O(1)` (in‚Äëplace) |
| Loop | `O(n)` | `O(1)` |

---

### 2. Python

```python
class Solution:
    def getMaximumConsecutive(self, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        coins.sort()                # 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sort
        reach = 1                   # 2Ô∏è‚É£ Initial reachable range
        for c in coins:             # 3Ô∏è‚É£ Greedy loop
            if c > reach:
                break
            reach += c
        return reach                # First unmakeable value
```

**Complexity**

*Time*: `O(n log n)` (sorting)  
*Space*: `O(1)` (in‚Äëplace sort for CPython)

---

### 3. C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getMaximumConsecutive(vector<int>& coins) {
        sort(coins.begin(), coins.end());   // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sort
        long long reach = 1;                // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Use long long to avoid overflow
        for (int c : coins) {               // 3Ô∏è‚É£ Greedy
            if (c > reach) break;
            reach += c;
        }
        return static_cast<int>(reach);
    }
};
```

**Complexity**

*Time*: `O(n log n)`  
*Space*: `O(1)` (in‚Äëplace sort)

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

When interviewers ask you to ‚Äúfind the maximum consecutive values you can make with a set of coins‚Äù, they‚Äôre testing a handful of core skills:

- **Algorithmic insight** (greedy vs. dynamic programming).
- **Coding style** (clear, concise, idiomatic).
- **Problem‚Äësolving mindset** (identifying edge cases, reasoning about optimality).

This post walks through the greedy solution that beats 100‚ÄØ% of the community in LeetCode, explains why it works, presents clean code in Java, Python, and C++, and finally reflects on what makes a great interview answer ‚Äì the good, the bad, and the ugly.

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement (LeetCode‚ÄØ1798)

> *You are given an integer array `coins`. You can pick any subset of these coins to sum to a value `x`. Return the maximum number of consecutive integers you can make starting from 0.*

**Key take‚Äëaway:** The answer is the first value you cannot make, which is also the sum of all coins you can successfully include while maintaining the greedy property.

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Greedy Idea ‚Äì The ‚ÄúGood‚Äù

- **Sorted order** guarantees that the smallest coin is considered first.
- **`reach` variable** tracks the smallest unattainable value.
- If the current coin `c` is **‚â§ reach**, you can extend the range to `reach + c`.  
  This is safe because all smaller values are already reachable.
- If `c` is **> reach**, you have a gap ‚Äì you cannot fill it with any remaining coins (they‚Äôre all ‚â• `c`).

**Why it works**: The greedy condition is a classic ‚Äúcovering interval‚Äù argument. By always using the smallest coin that fits, you never waste potential coverage.

---

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúThe Bad‚Äù ‚Äì Things to Avoid

| Mistake | Why it hurts | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **O(n¬≤) DP** (trying all subsets) | Exponential time, impossible for `n = 40‚ÄØ000`. | Use greedy + sorting. |
| **Ignoring overflow** | `reach + c` can exceed 32‚Äëbit int. | Use 64‚Äëbit (`long long`/`long`) when accumulating. |
| **Not sorting** | Without sorting, the greedy condition fails; you might miss a smaller coin that could close a gap. | Always sort first. |
| **Returning `reach - 1`** | The answer is the first *unmakeable* value; you want that value itself. | Return `reach`. |

---

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúThe Ugly‚Äù ‚Äì Edge Cases that Tricky Interviewers Love

1. **All ones**  
   ```text
   coins = [1,1,1,1,1]
   ```
   Every coin extends reach by 1.  
   **Answer:** `5 + 1 = 6` (values 0‚Äë5).

2. **Large single coin**  
   ```text
   coins = [1000]
   ```
   Reach starts at 1 ‚Üí coin > 1 ‚Üí break ‚Üí answer = 1.  

3. **Duplicate values**  
   No problem ‚Äì duplicates are naturally handled by sorting.

4. **Maximum constraints**  
   `coins.length = 40‚ÄØ000`, `coins[i] = 40‚ÄØ000` ‚Üí use 64‚Äëbit to avoid overflow.

5. **Mixed small and big**  
   ```text
   coins = [1, 1000000, 2]
   ```
   Sorted: `[1, 2, 1000000]`.  
   Reach after 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 4. Next coin 1,000,000 > 4 ‚Üí break.  
   Answer = 4.

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Code Walk‚Äëthrough ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Complete Solution‚Äù

##### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public int getMaximumConsecutive(int[] coins) {
        Arrays.sort(coins);
        long reach = 1;          // use long to avoid overflow
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (coin > reach) break;
            reach += coin;
        }
        return (int) reach;     // reach fits in int by problem constraints
    }
}
```

##### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def getMaximumConsecutive(self, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        coins.sort()
        reach = 1
        for c in coins:
            if c > reach:
                break
            reach += c
        return reach
```

##### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getMaximumConsecutive(vector<int>& coins) {
        sort(coins.begin(), coins.end());
        long long reach = 1;
        for (int c : coins) {
            if (c > reach) break;
            reach += c;
        }
        return static_cast<int>(reach);
    }
};
```

All three implementations are **O(n log n)** time and **O(1)** extra space.

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Complexity Analysis

| Implementation | Time | Space |
|----------------|------|-------|
| Java | `O(n log n)` (sorting) | `O(1)` |
| Python | `O(n log n)` | `O(1)` |
| C++ | `O(n log n)` | `O(1)` |

---

#### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Testing Checklist

| Test | Expected | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| `[1,3]` | `2` | 0,1 reachable; 2 is gap |
| `[1,1,1,4]` | `8` | 0‚Äë7 reachable |
| `[1,4,10,3,1]` | `20` | 0‚Äë19 reachable |
| `[5]` | `1` | 0 reachable, 1-4 not |
| `[1]*40000` | `40001` | All ones extend reach by 1 |
| `[100000]*40000` | `1` | No coin ‚â§ 1 |
| `[1,2,5,10,20]` | `38` | Cumulative sum 1+2+5+10+20=38 |

Run these tests in all three languages.

#### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Interview Take‚Äëaway

1. **Start with a clear strategy** ‚Äì state you‚Äôll sort and use greedy.  
2. **Explain the invariant** (`reach` is the smallest unreachable value).  
3. **Show the proof** (smallest coin that can close the gap).  
4. **Address edge cases** ‚Äì overflow, large values, duplicates.  
5. **Write clean code** ‚Äì short, commented, idiomatic.

A candidate who follows this roadmap demonstrates not just algorithmic knowledge, but also the ability to communicate and anticipate pitfalls‚Äîexactly what hiring managers value.

#### üîü Conclusion ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Good, the Bad, and the Ugly‚Äù in One Sentence

> *The greedy algorithm is elegant (good), but it requires careful handling of sorting and overflow (bad), and mastering edge cases is the secret sauce that turns a good solution into a memorable interview answer (ugly).*
