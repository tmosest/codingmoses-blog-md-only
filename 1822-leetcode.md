        ## 🎯 LeetCode 1822 – Sign of the Product of an Array  
### “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly” – A Job‑Ready Blog Post

---

### TL;DR  
- **Problem**: Given an integer array `nums`, return the sign of the product of all elements (`-1`, `0`, or `1`).  
- **Why it matters**: It’s a classic “one‑pass” interview problem that tests understanding of sign logic, early termination, and basic loop optimisation.  
- **Key take‑away**: The optimal solution runs **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space, using a simple counter for negative numbers and an early exit for zeros.

## 1. Problem Overview

> **LeetCode 1822 – Sign of the Product of an Array**  
> *Difficulty*: Easy  

**Input**  
```text
nums – an integer array of length 1…1000, each element in [-100, 100]
```

**Output**  
```
-1  if the product is negative
 0  if the product is zero
 1  if the product is positive
```

**Examples**

| nums                                 | product | sign |
|--------------------------------------|---------|------|
| `[-1,-2,-3,-4,3,2,1]`                | 144     | 1    |
| `[1,5,0,2,-3]`                       | 0       | 0    |
| `[-1,1,-1,1,-1]`                     | -1      | -1   |

## 2. Why It’s a “Must‑Know” Interview Question

| Skill Tested | How It Helps in a Job Interview |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| **Loop efficiency** | Demonstrates you can write a single pass algorithm. |
| **Edge‑case handling** | You handle zero, negative, and positive values correctly. |
| **Space optimisation** | Show you can keep O(1) space, a common interview demand. |
| **Language versatility** | Solvable in Java, Python, C++, and many other languages. |

## 3. The Good – Simple, Clean, Optimal

### 3.1 Idea
1. **Early zero detection** – If any element is `0`, the product is `0` → return `0` immediately.  
2. **Count negatives** – Keep a counter of how many negative numbers appear.  
3. **Return sign** – If the count of negatives is even → product positive (`1`); otherwise negative (`-1`).

### 3.2 Complexity
- **Time**: `O(n)` – one scan through the array.  
- **Space**: `O(1)` – only a few integer variables.

## 4. The Bad – Over‑Complicated or Wrong

| Bad Approach | Why It’s Bad |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Using `BigInteger` / `long long` to compute the product** | Overflow risk, unnecessary memory, slows the code. |
| **Re‑iterating the array to count positives/negatives after a zero check** | Extra passes, still O(n) but more work. |
| **Returning `Math.signum(product)` after computing the product** | Same overflow problem, not a one‑pass solution. |

---

## 5. The Ugly – Bugs & Edge‑Case Pitfalls

| Common Bug | How to Fix |
|------------|------------|
| Not checking for `0` → returns wrong sign for arrays containing zero. | Add `if (num == 0) return 0;` as early exit. |
| Forgetting that an odd number of negatives gives `-1`. | `return (negatives % 2 == 0) ? 1 : -1;` |
| Using `int` to store the product in a language with 32‑bit overflow. | Avoid product calculation entirely. |

## 6. Code Solutions

Below are **three** concise, production‑ready solutions – one for each major language.

### 6.1 Java (LeetCode Style)

```java
/**
 * 1822. Sign of the Product of an Array
 */
public class Solution {
    public int arraySign(int[] nums) {
        int negatives = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 0) return 0;          // Early exit
            if (num < 0) negatives++;        // Count negatives
        }
        return (negatives % 2 == 0) ? 1 : -1;
    }
}
```

> **Why it shines**  
> *One loop*, *constant space*, *early zero detection*.

---

### 6.2 Python

```python
# 1822. Sign of the Product of an Array
from typing import List

def arraySign(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    negatives = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num == 0:
            return 0               # early exit
        if num < 0:
            negatives += 1
    return 1 if negatives % 2 == 0 else -1
```

> **Pythonic touch** – `typing.List` keeps the signature clear for recruiters.

---

### 6.3 C++

```cpp
// 1822. Sign of the Product of an Array
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int arraySign(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int negCount = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 0) return 0;   // Early exit
            if (num < 0) negCount++;  // Count negatives
        }
        return (negCount % 2 == 0) ? 1 : -1;
    }
};
```

> **Efficiency** – Uses range‑based for, constant space.
