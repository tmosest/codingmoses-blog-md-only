### Java (Fastest 0 ms on LeetCode)

```java
/**
 * 1822. Sign of the Product of an Array
 *
 * @see https://leetcode.com/problems/sign-of-the-product-of-an-array/
 */
class Solution {
    public int arraySign(int[] nums) {
        int sign = 1;                 // +1 means product is positive
        for (int n : nums) {
            if (n == 0) {            // any zero makes the product 0
                return 0;
            }
            if (n < 0) {             // flip sign for each negative
                sign = -sign;
            }
        }
        return sign;
    }
}
```

> **Key tricks**  
> * Keep a single `sign` variable – no need for a counter + `%2`.  
> * Early exit on `0` gives the best possible time.

### Python (Elegant One‑liner Variant)

```python
class Solution:
    def arraySign(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # -1 for each negative, 0 if any element is 0
        prod_sign = 1
        for n in nums:
            if n == 0:
                return 0
            if n < 0:
                prod_sign *= -1
        return prod_sign
```

> **Why a loop?**  
> LeetCode’s time limit is generous; a loop is clearer than `math.prod`.

---

### C++ (Classic STL)

```cpp
/**
 * 1822. Sign of the Product of an Array
 * @see https://leetcode.com/problems/sign-of-the-product-of-an-array/
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int arraySign(vector<int>& nums) {
        int sign = 1;
        for (int n : nums) {
            if (n == 0) return 0;
            if (n < 0) sign = -sign;
        }
        return sign;
    }
};
```

> **Why `vector<int>&`?**  
> Pass by reference for O(1) copy overhead.

### 1. Problem Recap

> **Goal:** Return `1` if the product of an integer array is positive, `-1` if negative, and `0` if zero.  
> **Constraints:** `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`, `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`.

The product itself can explode beyond 64‑bit range, so we **never** compute it. We only care about its sign.

---

### 2. Why This Problem Rocks for Interviews

| Reason | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Simplicity** | Show that you can solve a 100‑point problem in ~5 lines. |
| **Core skill** | Tests counting, sign logic, and early‑exit optimizations. |
| **Language agnostic** | You can present the same solution in Java, Python, C++ – perfect for multi‑stack interviews. |
| **Interview signal** | Demonstrates quick thinking and the ability to spot overflow pitfalls. |

---

### 3. The Good: Clean, Fast, Idiomatic Solutions

#### 3.1 Java

```java
int sign = 1;
for (int n : nums) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;   // early exit
    if (n < 0) sign = -sign; // flip sign
}
return sign;
```

- **Time:** `O(n)` – one pass.  
- **Space:** `O(1)` – no extra containers.  
- **Why it’s great:**  
  * No modulo, no counter – just a sign flip.  
  * `return 0` right away when encountering zero (fastest possible path).  
  * Compiles to a single machine instruction per element on the JVM.  

#### 3.2 Python

```python
prod_sign = 1
for n in nums:
    if n == 0: return 0
    if n < 0: prod_sign *= -1
return prod_sign
```

- **Why Python?**  
  * Simple list‑iteration.  
  * `math.prod` would blow up on large arrays; we avoid it.  

#### 3.3 C++

```cpp
int sign = 1;
for (int n : nums) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n < 0) sign = -sign;
}
return sign;
```

- **Why C++?**  
  * Uses range‑based for loops, clean syntax.  
  * Perfect for showing off STL knowledge while staying low‑level.

### 4. The Bad: Over‑Engineering & Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why it’s bad | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Counting negatives and using `% 2`** | Adds an extra variable and modulo operation; unnecessary overhead. | Flip sign directly. |
| **Using `int` to store product** | Overflows (`int` max ~2 billion). | Never compute product; only track sign. |
| **Recursively computing sign** | Stack overflow risk for 1000 elements. | Use iterative loop. |
| **Using `StringBuilder` or extra arrays** | Extra memory usage, slower. | Keep `O(1)` space. |

---

### 5. The Ugly: Edge Cases & Performance Traps

| Edge Case | Typical Pitfall | How to Avoid |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Array with a single `0` | Return `0` – many people forget to check early. | Add `if (n == 0) return 0;` at top of loop. |
| All positives | Sign stays `1`. | No special handling needed. |
| Mixed signs, odd negative count | Must return `-1`. | Flip sign each time you see a negative. |
| Negative numbers equal to `-1` or `-100` | Same logic applies. | No extra code. |

**Performance trap:** Some solutions pre‑compute `Math.signum(n)` inside the loop, causing a double branch. The simplest sign flip is fastest on modern CPUs.
