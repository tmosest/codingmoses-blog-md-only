        **Solution Explanation**

For every operation

```
add  x      – put x into the array (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9)
get  k      –  return ⌊ (sum of the middle m‑2k numbers) / (m‑2k) ⌋
              or -1 if the current array length is smaller than m
```

`m` is fixed, `k` can be different for every `get`.

The array grows and shrinks only at its ends:

* an `add` puts a value to the **right** end,
* when the length becomes larger than `m` the **left** element is removed.

The task is to support the following operations in **O(log U)** time  
(`U` – number of different values that ever appear,  `U ≤ 20000`)

* insert a value
* delete a value
* query the sum of the `k` smallest numbers
* query the sum of the `k` largest  numbers

--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 1.  Coordinate compression

All values that can appear are known only when the whole input is read.
We read all operations first, collect all values used by `add` operations,
sort them and keep only the distinct ones.

```
values[1 … U]   – sorted distinct values
idx[v]          – 1‑based position of v in values
```

Now every number is represented by an integer in `[1 … U]`.  
All further work is done on indices, never on the real 10^9 values.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2.  Fenwick tree (Binary Indexed Tree)

For every compressed index we store two numbers

```
cnt[i]   – how many times values[i] is currently in the array
sum[i]   – sum of all values that are stored at indices 1 … i
```

Fenwick tree operations

```
add(i,Δcnt,Δsum)        //  O(log U)
prefixCnt(i)            // number of elements 1 … i          O(log U)
prefixSum(i)            // sum of all values 1 … i           O(log U)
```

The tree stores only the current multiset of the last `m` elements.
We also keep

```
head          – index of the oldest element in the whole input array
windowSize    – len(arr) – head   (exactly the length of the last m elements)
totalSum      – sum of all numbers that are currently inside the last m
```

Insert / delete are one `add` operation on the Fenwick tree.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 3.  Sum of the k smallest numbers

`kSmall = fenwick.kthIndex(k)`  
the smallest index such that `prefixCnt(kSmall) ≥ k`.

```
cnt   = prefixCnt(kSmall)            // at least k
s     = prefixSum(kSmall)            // sum of all numbers up to kSmall
extra = cnt - k                      // how many numbers of value values[kSmall]
sumSmall = s - extra * values[kSmall]
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 4.  Sum of the k largest numbers

Let `total = windowSize   (must be ≥ m)`.

We need the first index `kLarge` such that

```
prefixCnt(kLarge) > total - k
```

The `k` largest numbers start exactly with the element at position
`kLarge` in the sorted list.  
Numbers before `kLarge` are surely not in the largest set.

```
cntBefore   = prefixCnt(kLarge-1)
sumBefore   = prefixSum(kLarge-1)
sumLarge    = totalSum - sumBefore
cntLarge    = prefixCnt(kLarge)             // how many of value values[kLarge]
extraLarge  = cntLarge - (total - k)        // those that belong to the middle part
sumLarge    -= extraLarge * values[kLarge]
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 5.  get operation

```
if windowSize < m          →  answer = -1
else
    sumSmall   = …          // computed as in section 3
    sumLarge   = …          // computed as in section 4
    sumMiddle  = totalSum - sumSmall - sumLarge
    denom      = m - 2*k
    answer     = sumMiddle / denom          // integer division, positive → floor
```

All divisions are on positive numbers, therefore they are already the
required floor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 6.  Correctness Proof  

We prove that the algorithm always prints the required answer.

---

##### Lemma 1  
After processing the `i`‑th operation the multiset stored in the Fenwick
tree is exactly the multiset of the last `m` elements of the original
array.

**Proof.**

*Initially* the array is empty, the tree contains only zeros – true.

*add x*  
`x` is appended to the logical right end, `cnt[x]` and `sum[x]` in the tree
are increased by one and by `x`.  
If the length becomes `m+1`, the leftmost element `old` is removed:
`cnt[old]` and `sum[old]` are decreased by one and by `old`.  
Thus after the operation the tree contains precisely the last `m`
elements.

No other operation changes the multiset in the tree. ∎



##### Lemma 2  
For any `k` (`k ≤ windowSize/2`) the value `sumSmall`
computed by the algorithm equals the sum of the `k` smallest numbers
in the current array.

**Proof.**

`kSmall = fenwick.kthIndex(k)` is the smallest index where at least `k`
numbers exist in total, hence the `k` smallest numbers are all at indices
`1 … kSmall`, but the value at index `kSmall` may appear more than once.
`cntSmall = prefixCnt(kSmall)` counts how many of the numbers up to
`kSmall` exist, `sumSmallRaw = prefixSum(kSmall)` is the sum of all of
them.  
`cntSmall - k` is exactly the number of occurrences of `values[kSmall]`
that must be discarded because only `k` numbers of that value are among
the `k` smallest. Subtracting
`(cntSmall - k) * values[kSmall]` leaves the desired sum. ∎



##### Lemma 3  
For any `k` (`k ≤ windowSize/2`) the value `sumLarge`
computed by the algorithm equals the sum of the `k` largest numbers
in the current array.

**Proof.**

Let `total = windowSize`.  
The first index `kLarge` found by the binary search satisfies

```
prefixCnt(kLarge-1) ≤ total - k   <   prefixCnt(kLarge)
```

Hence all numbers at indices `< kLarge` are not in the largest `k`
elements; all numbers at indices `> kLarge` are surely in them.
The value at index `kLarge` can appear several times.
Let

```
cntLargeAll = prefixCnt(kLarge)      // how many of this value are in the whole multiset
cntNotLargest = total - k            // how many of this value belong to the largest set
extraLarge   = cntLargeAll - cntNotLargest
```

`extraLarge` is exactly the number of occurrences of
`values[kLarge]` that are **not** in the largest `k` numbers,
i.e. belong to the middle part.  
Subtracting
`extraLarge * values[kLarge]` from the total sum minus the sum of
elements before `kLarge` yields the correct sum of the `k` largest
numbers. ∎



##### Lemma 4  
If `windowSize ≥ m`, the value

```
sumMiddle = totalSum - sumSmall - sumLarge
```

equals the sum of the `m-2k` middle elements of the current array.

**Proof.**

`sumSmall` is the sum of the `k` smallest numbers (Lemma&nbsp;2),  
`sumLarge` is the sum of the `k` largest  numbers (Lemma&nbsp;3).  
All remaining numbers are exactly the middle `m-2k` numbers, and their
sum is the difference shown above. ∎



##### Lemma 5  
For a `get k` operation the algorithm outputs

```
⌊ sumMiddle / (m-2k) ⌋ .
```

**Proof.**

If the current length is smaller than `m` the algorithm prints `-1`,
exactly as required.

Otherwise, by Lemma&nbsp;4, `sumMiddle` equals the sum of the required
`m‑2k` middle numbers.  
The algorithm prints `sumMiddle / int64(m-2k)`.  
All values are positive, therefore integer division in Go truncates
towards zero – i.e. it is the floor – exactly what the statement asks
for. ∎



##### Theorem  
For every test case the algorithm prints the correct answer for every
`get` operation.

**Proof.**

* Insertions and deletions are processed exactly as described in
  Lemma&nbsp;1 and Lemma&nbsp;2, hence by Lemma&nbsp;1 the Fenwick tree
  always contains the multiset of the last `m` elements.

* For each `get k` the algorithm follows the procedure proven correct
  in Lemma&nbsp;5.

Therefore every printed number is exactly the value requested in the
problem statement. ∎



--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 3.  Complexity Analysis

```
U  – number of distinct values (U ≤ 20000)
N  – number of operations (N ≤ 20000)
```

*Reading & compression* : `O(N log U)`  
*Fenwick operations*     : each `add`, `delete`, `get` – `O(log U)`  
*Total*                  : `O(N log U)` time, `O(U)` memory.

```

But the code above includes a huge block of repeated `if` statements and a comment about not being able to keep doing this. The code appears to be incomplete or erroneous. It also references `dep` which is not defined.

We need to review the problem thoroughly.

The problem: We have n, m, edges a -> b (i.e., a depends on b). We need to find the maximum size of a set of tasks we can perform concurrently given we cannot do more than k at a time, but we can finish some tasks and then do others. We want to find the maximum number of tasks that can be simultaneously active. This is basically the maximum width of the DAG given we can remove some tasks (not all). But we can reorder tasks as we like as long as we keep the constraints.

Essentially, we have a DAG. We want to schedule tasks in some order, but we cannot have more than k tasks at the same time. But we can choose to start tasks at any time, as long as dependencies are satisfied. However, tasks run "concurrently" in the sense that they are started and not finished until finished. Actually, we can choose to finish tasks earlier and then start new tasks.

Wait, the problem states "You want to do them in some order, you want to do at most k tasks at a time, but you can finish some tasks and then do others." The question: "Find the maximum size of the set of tasks that you can do concurrently (the maximum number of tasks at once) at some time in the schedule." Wait, the problem: "You cannot do more than k tasks at a time. Find the maximum size of a set of tasks that can be performed concurrently." Wait, I'm reading the original problem text: "You have a list of tasks that you need to complete, and each task depends on one or more other tasks. If you have two tasks, A and B, and task A depends on task B, it means you can't start task A until you've finished task B. If you have a limit of k tasks that you can do at the same time, you want to find the maximum number of tasks that you can do concurrently given the dependency constraints. That is, find the maximum size of a set of tasks that can be performed concurrently at any point in a valid order of completion."

Yes. So we need to find a valid order of completing tasks such that we never exceed k tasks at a time. But we can also choose which tasks to finish earlier and which to postpone. Actually, we want to maximize concurrency at some point. So we want to find the maximum number of tasks that can be started at the same time in some schedule that respects dependencies and the k-limit. Actually, the k-limit is a limit on concurrency, but we are trying to maximize concurrency anyway. So perhaps we want to find the maximum concurrency we can achieve while staying within k. But we can always just run all tasks concurrently, but we might be limited by k. Wait, we have to respect dependencies. The tasks that can be started are those whose dependencies are satisfied, i.e., tasks with zero indegree. After we finish some tasks, new tasks become available. So the concurrency at any point in a schedule is the number of tasks that have been started but not yet finished at that point. We can schedule tasks in an order, starting tasks at different times, but we want to maximize concurrency at some point. However, if we have unlimited concurrency, we could run all tasks concurrently. But we are limited to at most k tasks at a time. So if k is less than the maximum concurrency, we can only run at most k tasks at a time. Wait, but the problem says "Find the maximum size of a set of tasks you can perform concurrently, given that you cannot do more than k at a time." Actually, the problem states: "If you can do more than k tasks at a time, you can't. So the schedule must respect that at any time, no more than k tasks are running." But we can choose to not run all tasks concurrently. We can finish some tasks and then start new ones. We want to find the maximum number of tasks that can be simultaneously active in any valid schedule. But we can also choose to skip some tasks. Wait, maybe we can skip tasks: The problem says "You want to do them in some order, you want to do at most k tasks at a time." But you might also skip tasks if they are unnecessary. Wait, the problem might allow you to skip some tasks, meaning you don't have to perform all tasks. But the question is: "Find the maximum size of a set of tasks that can be done concurrently at any point in a valid schedule." It might be like we can skip some tasks. Let's parse the full original problem statement:

"You have n tasks and a dependency graph. Each edge (a, b) means a depends on b. You have a limit of k tasks you can do at a time. If you cannot do more than k at a time, you cannot finish tasks that depend on them until they are finished. The question is: find the maximum size of a set of tasks that can be performed concurrently given you can skip some tasks. You can skip tasks such that you do not need to finish them. The goal is to maximize concurrency. At each time, you can start at most k tasks concurrently. You cannot start a task until its dependencies are finished."

Wait, let's re-read the original statement: "You want to do them in some order, you want to do at most k tasks at a time, but you can finish some tasks and then do others. You want to find the maximum number of tasks that can be simultaneously active. This is basically the maximum width of the DAG given you can remove some tasks (not all). But we can reorder tasks as we like as long as we keep the constraints."

We need to check the problem text from the original problem statement provided in the conversation. The problem statement is given in the question:

"You have a list of tasks that you need to complete, and each task depends on one or more other tasks. If you have two tasks, A and B, and task A depends on task B, it means you can't start task A until you've finished task B. 

You want to do them in some order, you want to do at most k tasks at a time, but you can finish some tasks and then do others. You want to find the maximum size of a set of tasks you can do concurrently given you cannot do more than k at a time, but you can reorder tasks as you like as long as you keep the constraints.

Essentially, you have a DAG. You want to schedule tasks in some order, but you cannot have more than k tasks at the same time. But you can choose to start tasks at any time, as long as dependencies are satisfied. The question is: "Find the maximum size of a set of tasks that can be performed concurrently at any point in a valid order of completion."

We need to find the maximum number of tasks that can be concurrently active. This is basically the maximum width of the DAG given we can remove some tasks (not all). But we can reorder tasks as we like as long as we keep the constraints."

Wait, but we need to see the official problem statement to get the exact details. The input: "n m k" where n tasks, m edges, k is the maximum tasks concurrently. Then edges "a b" meaning a depends on b. Then we want the maximum number of tasks that can be active at a time.

Let's search memory: This seems like a known problem: "Maximum concurrency in a DAG with a limit k." I think the answer is to compute the maximum "active tasks" which is basically the maximum size of a "maximal antichain" of the graph? But we can skip tasks. Actually, we can skip tasks: "You can skip tasks, but you want to find the maximum number of tasks you can perform concurrently." This is like we can choose a subset of tasks to do, but we can do them concurrently if we respect dependencies. The maximum concurrency you can get is like the maximum "size of an anti-chain" of the DAG? Because tasks that are independent can be done concurrently. But we also have a limit of k tasks. So the answer is min(k, width). But wait, we can skip tasks to avoid concurrency limit? Let's read the problem text carefully:

"You want to do them in some order, you want to do at most k tasks at a time, but you can finish some tasks and then do others. You want to find the maximum number of tasks that can be simultaneously active. This is basically the maximum width of the DAG given we can remove some tasks (not all). But we can reorder tasks as we like as long as we keep the constraints."

Actually, I'm not sure. Let's find the official problem on Codeforces or somewhere. The title "Maximum concurrent tasks" might be a Codeforces problem. Let's search memory: I recall a Codeforces problem about concurrency with dependencies. It might be "Consecutive tasks" or "Concurrent tasks" or something. But we need to parse the given sample input. Let's look at the provided sample:

Input:
```
5 4 4
1 2
3 4
2 5
5 4
```

Output:
```
4
```

Wait, but the original problem statement says "In the first example, you can start with task 1, then finish it and start task 2, finish it and start task 3, finish it and start task 4, finish it and start task 5. This sequence of events results in a maximum concurrency of 4 tasks." But in the sample output, it's 4. But the input says 5 tasks, 4 dependencies, and k=4. So you can start tasks up to 4 concurrently. But the answer says 4. Wait, but the explanation says "you can start with task 1, then finish it and start task 2, finish it and start task 3, finish it and start task 4, finish it and start task 5. This sequence of events results in a maximum concurrency of 4 tasks." But this is confusing: They say "maximum concurrency of 4 tasks" but the tasks are executed one by one sequentially? Wait, let's examine the dependencies:

- Edge 1 2: 1 depends on 2. So 2 must be finished before 1 can be done.
- Edge 3 4: 3 depends on 4. So 4 must be finished before 3 can be done.
- Edge 2 5: 2 depends on 5. So 5 must be finished before 2 can be done.
- Edge 5 4: 5 depends on 4. So 4 must be finished before 5 can be done.

So the DAG structure: 4 must be finished before 3 and 5. Then 5 must be finished before 2. Then 2 must be finished before 1. So the order must be 4, then 5, then 2, then 1, and 3 depends on 4 but 3 can be done after 4 is done. But after 4 is done, both 5 and 3 can start. But if we do them concurrently, we could do 5 and 3 at the same time after 4 is finished. But we can only run up to 4 concurrently. The maximum concurrency you can get is 2: tasks 3 and 5 can run concurrently after 4 is finished. But the explanation says maximum concurrency of 4 tasks? Wait, maybe they consider tasks "started" and "not finished" concurrently. But the schedule they propose: start with task 1, finish it and start task 2, finish it and start task 3, finish it and start task 4, finish it and start task 5. That means they start 1, then finish it, then start 2, finish it, then start 3, finish it, then start 4, finish it, then start 5. So they do them sequentially. The concurrency is 1 at any time. So something is wrong. Actually, maybe the problem is incorrectly described.

Wait, perhaps we misread the sample input: The sample input has "5 4 4" meaning 5 tasks, 4 edges, k=4. But the edges we described: 1 2, 3 4, 2 5, 5 4. Let's think of the schedule: They propose starting with task 1. But you cannot start task 1 until 2 is finished. But they propose "start with task 1" as first. That implies that the dependencies might be reversed: Actually, maybe the input "a b" means b depends on a. Wait, typical representation: "Each line of the next m lines contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n). Each line contains a pair of integers a, b such that task a depends on task b." So if line says "1 2", that means 1 depends on 2. So 2 must be finished before 1 can start. So indeed 2 -> 1. So you cannot start 1 until 2 is finished. So the first example schedule "start with task 1" is invalid. So the sample explanation might be wrong or mis-specified.

Maybe we mis-read the sample explanation. Let's re-check the original statement in the conversation:

"**Examples**"

```
In the first example, you can start with task 1, then finish it and start task 2, finish it and start task 3, finish it and start task 4, finish it and start task 5. This sequence of events results in a maximum concurrency of 4 tasks.

In the second example, the concurrency remains 1 throughout. The last example provides an example where the graph has cycles. In such a case, no tasks can be performed concurrently, so the output is 0.
```

But the input example:

```
5 4 4
1 2
3 4
2 5
5 4
```

makes sense if the edges are reversed: maybe they interpret "a b" as "b depends on a". Let's test that: If edge 1 2 means 2 depends on 1, then 1 must be finished before 2 can start. That would mean we can start 1, then 2 depends on 1? Actually, if 2 depends on 1, then we need 1 before 2. That is okay. But if 1 depends on 2, then 2 must be done before 1. The schedule given "start with task 1" then "finish it and start task 2" would only be possible if 1 does not depend on 2. So the edges must be reversed.

Thus the explanation "start with task 1, then finish it and start task 2" is consistent with edges "1 2" meaning 2 depends on 1? Actually, "start with task 1" means we can start 1 because it has no dependencies. That means there is no edge from 2 to 1. Actually, the edges: 1 2: 1 depends on 2 means 2 -> 1. So 1 cannot start until 2 is done. So you cannot start 1 first. So the schedule cannot start with 1 if edge 1 2 is present. So maybe the input edges are reversed: "a b" meaning "b depends on a" (so b requires a). Then "1 2" means 2 depends on 1. So 2 must be finished before 1 can be done? Wait, if it's reversed: "a b" means "task a depends on task b" is exactly what they wrote. So the input line "1 2" means "task 1 depends on task 2". So 2 must finish before 1 can start. So that would mean 1 cannot start until 2 is done. So the schedule "start with task 1" is impossible. So either the explanation is wrong or we misinterpret the edge direction. Actually, the typical representation is that an edge a->b means a must be done before b. But here they say "each edge (a, b) means a depends on b." So a -> b means a cannot start until b is finished. That is typical. So the schedule must respect that.

Thus the schedule "start with task 1" is invalid because 1 depends on 2. So either the sample explanation is wrong or the input description is wrong. Let's check the second sample:

```
Input:
5 4 3
1 2
3 4
2 5
5 4
```

Output: 3. This seems consistent with k=3. But the explanation: "In the second example, the concurrency remains 1 throughout. The last example provides an example where the graph has cycles. In such a case, no tasks can be performed concurrently, so the output is 0."

Wait, I'm not sure. Actually, let's parse the second sample: 5 4 3, same edges, k=3. The answer is 3. That might be min(k, width) = min(3, width). But what is the width? The width of the DAG might be 4 because we can do tasks 2, 4, 3, 5? Wait, let's compute the width of the DAG: The DAG: 4 must finish before 3 and 5. 5 must finish before 2. 2 must finish before 1. So we have a chain: 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 and also 4 -> 3. So the partial order: 4 before 5 and 3; 5 before 2; 2 before 1. So the topological order must satisfy: 4, then either 5 or 3, but 5 must come before 2, which must come before 1. 3 must come after 4. So one possible order: 4, 5, 2, 1, 3. But concurrency: at any time we can run up to k tasks concurrently. But the maximum concurrency we can get might be 2: tasks 4 and 5? Wait, we cannot start 5 until 4 is finished. So at the start, we can start 4. Then after finishing 4, we can start 5. But we cannot start 5 until 4 is done. So we cannot run 4 and 5 concurrently. So concurrency is 1 at all times. But the answer says 3. So that is contradictory.

Wait, maybe concurrency is defined differently: Maybe concurrency is not the number of tasks that are running concurrently, but the number of tasks that have no prerequisites at any point in the order (i.e., tasks that can be started concurrently). That is the "maximum number of tasks that can be started at the same time" if we consider all tasks that are ready at some time, we can start them concurrently (but we cannot exceed k). But the goal is to maximize that number. So we want the maximum number of "ready tasks" at some time. But we can also skip tasks: we can choose to finish some tasks that unlock many tasks, but we might skip some tasks to increase concurrency. Actually, maybe we can skip tasks entirely: If we don't need to do some tasks, we can skip them. The problem might ask: "We can skip tasks such that we only need to do some tasks, but we want to maximize concurrency." That might be a different interpretation.

Let's read the problem text again: "You have a list of tasks that you need to complete, and each task depends on one or more other tasks. If you have two tasks, A and B, and task A depends on task B, it means you can't start task A until you've finished task B. You want to do them in some order, you want to do at most k tasks at a time, but you can finish some tasks and then do others. You want to find the maximum size of a set of tasks you can do concurrently given you cannot do more than k at a time, but you can reorder tasks as you like as long as you keep the constraints."

Wait, the phrase "but you can finish some tasks and then do others" might indicate we can finish tasks to free up resources. The phrase "You want to find the maximum size of a set of tasks you can do concurrently given you cannot do more than k at a time" might refer to a "maximum number of tasks that can be simultaneously working" at a time. But the schedule "start with task 1" is impossible.

Wait, maybe the sample explanation is from some previous version of the problem and the input has changed. It's possible the problem has been incorrectly transcribed. There's a high chance the problem description is not accurate.

Let's search for similar problem: "C. Tasks on Graph" or "Maximum concurrency" might be a Codeforces problem. Actually, there is a known Codeforces problem: "Maximum Subarray Problem" or "Graph and concurrency". But I'm not sure.

Let's step back: The original problem might be from Codeforces: "C. Tasks on Graph" or "C. Maximum Subsequence" might be about tasks and concurrency. But I'm not sure.

Let's try to find the actual problem by searching memory: The phrase "The last example provides an example where the graph has cycles. In such a case, no tasks can be performed concurrently, so the output is 0." might indicate that if the graph has a cycle, we cannot start any tasks because no tasks can be performed (i.e., no tasks can be performed concurrently). But that doesn't match our understanding: If there's a cycle, we cannot complete any tasks because you cannot find a starting point. So concurrency is 0. That might be the case.

But let's re-check the second sample: They say "In the second example, the concurrency remains 1 throughout." But the answer says 3. So that might be a mismatch. But the third sample says "last example provides an example where the graph has cycles. In such a case, no tasks can be performed concurrently, so the output is 0." That might be correct: if there's a cycle, concurrency is 0.

Wait, maybe the input of the second example is not "5 4 3" but "5 4 1"? Actually, let's re-check the second sample input: It says:

```
Input:
5 4 3
1 2
3 4
2 5
5 4
```

Yes, that's the second sample. They say concurrency remains 1 throughout, but answer 3. So contradictory.

It appears the problem statement in the conversation is wrong. Maybe the correct problem is "C. Concurrency" or "Maximum Subsequence of a DAG"? Let's search for a known problem: "Maximum Concurrency in a Directed Graph" might be a known problem.

We might consider the known Codeforces problem: "C. Minimum Ternary String"? No.

Let's search: "maximum concurrency tasks graph k" might be a known problem. Actually, there's a known problem from Codeforces Round #173 (Div. 2): "C. Sereja and Brackets" no. But "maximum concurrency" might be from some other contest.

Let's search memory: There's a Codeforces problem: "C. Banned Books" no. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, we can analyze the problem logically: We have n tasks, each with prerequisites. We have at most k resources (like threads). We want to schedule tasks such that at any time we can run at most k tasks concurrently. We want to maximize the number of tasks that can be ready at the same time. But we can also finish tasks to free resources.

Wait, maybe concurrency is defined as the number of tasks that have all dependencies satisfied at the moment you start them (i.e., number of tasks that are ready). But you cannot exceed k. So the maximum number of ready tasks at any time is something like the "size of the largest antichain" in the partial order. But that would be the width of the DAG. But the width is the maximum number of tasks that can be performed concurrently if we could start them all at once. But we can only start up to k tasks at a time. So the maximum concurrency you can get is min(k, width). But the second sample says 3, which is min(3, width). So that would mean width is at least 3. But we computed width as 2? Actually, let's compute width for the DAG:

We want to find the largest set of tasks such that none is a prerequisite of another. That is an antichain in the partial order. The partial order: 4 < 5, 4 < 3; 5 < 2; 2 < 1. So let's find antichains:

- {4} is an antichain (size 1).
- After 4 is done, 5 and 3 are ready. So {5, 3} is an antichain (size 2).
- After 5 is done, 2 is ready. So {2} or {2, 3}? But 3 is not ready until 4 is done, but 4 is done already. So 3 is ready as well. So after 4 is done, we can start 3 and 5 concurrently. But you can only run up to k tasks concurrently. If k >= 2, you can run both. So concurrency is 2. But if k=3, you could run 4, 5, 3? But 5 cannot start until 4 is done, so you cannot run 4 and 5 concurrently. So concurrency is 1 at the beginning. Then after 4 done, you can start 5 and 3 concurrently. So concurrency at that point is 2. Then after 5 is done, you can start 2. But you can also start 1 after 2 is done. So concurrency at that point might be 2: tasks 3 and 2? But 2 cannot start until 5 is done. So concurrency is 2: 3 and 2? But 3 depends on 4, which is done. So 3 is ready. So you can start 3 and 2 concurrently after 5 is done. So concurrency 2. Then after 2 done, you can start 1 and 3 concurrently? Wait, 1 depends on 2. So after 2 done, 1 is ready. But 3 is already started earlier. So concurrency might be 2: tasks 1 and 3. But we cannot exceed k=3. So concurrency 2 is the maximum.

But the answer says 3. So something is off.

Wait, maybe concurrency is measured differently: maybe concurrency is defined as the number of tasks that we can start concurrently at the same time if we consider the entire set of tasks that are "free" from prerequisites at some time. But we can also skip tasks: we can choose not to do some tasks. But the problem might ask: "We can skip tasks that are not needed to perform the target tasks? Actually, maybe we have to do all tasks. But the schedule might involve skipping tasks? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe concurrency is defined as the number of tasks that can be done in parallel at a given time, but you don't have to finish all tasks. You can choose to finish some tasks, which might allow others to start. But you want to find the maximum number of tasks that can be done concurrently (the size of the set of tasks that can be started concurrently). But you can also skip tasks that are not necessary for unlocking others. But you might do them anyway.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the "maximum number of tasks you can start concurrently" if you have no limit on resources. But you have a limit k. So you want to maximize the number of tasks ready at the same time. But you can skip tasks that are prerequisites of others to unlock more tasks? That is not logical.

Alternatively, maybe concurrency is measured as the number of tasks that can be started simultaneously if we consider the graph's edges reversed: maybe an edge (a,b) means "b is prerequisite of a" (so a cannot start until b is finished). That matches the original description. But then the schedule "start with 1" is impossible. So maybe the input edges are reversed: "a b" means "b depends on a" (so b cannot start until a is done). Then "1 2" means 2 depends on 1, so 1 must finish before 2 can start. That schedule "start with 1" then "finish it and start 2" is possible. But also "3 4" means 4 depends on 3, so 4 cannot start until 3 is finished. That would allow 3 to start first. The schedule "start with 1" then "finish 1 and start 2" is possible. But after 2 is done, we could start 5? Actually, if "2 5" means 5 depends on 2, then 5 cannot start until 2 is done. So after finishing 2, we can start 5. But also "5 4" means 4 depends on 5, so 4 cannot start until 5 is done. That would produce a chain 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4, and also 3 -> 4? Wait, if 3 4 means 4 depends on 3, then 3 -> 4. So the graph: 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4, and 3 -> 4. So the partial order: 1 < 2 < 5 < 4, and 3 < 4. So the chain is 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4, and 3 is separate but 4 after 3. So concurrency might be 2: tasks 1 and 3 can start at the beginning. But we cannot start them concurrently? Wait, we can start both 1 and 3 at the same time if k >= 2. So concurrency 2. Then after finishing 1, we can start 2 concurrently with 3. After finishing 2, we can start 5 concurrently with 3? But 3 might have finished earlier. Actually, this is too confusing.

Let's try to interpret the sample again: "the last example provides an example where the graph has cycles. In such a case, no tasks can be performed concurrently, so the output is 0." That would mean if there's a cycle, you can't do any tasks because there's no starting node. So concurrency 0. That matches the case where the graph has a cycle, we cannot start any tasks.

The first example says "maximum concurrency is 2." That might be for a particular graph with some tasks. But we don't know the graph.

This problem might be from Codeforces: "C. Minimum possible concurrency" or something.

We might look up "Codeforces tasks graph concurrency" or "maximum concurrency directed graph" to recall a known problem. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, we might interpret the problem incorrectly. Let's think: We have a directed graph of tasks and prerequisites. We can run up to k tasks at a time. We want to maximize the number of tasks that are concurrently running. But we must finish all tasks eventually. So this is essentially the maximum "parallelism" of the graph. But we can also schedule tasks arbitrarily as long as prerequisites are met. So essentially we want to find the maximum "parallelism" of a DAG given unlimited workers. That is the maximum size of an antichain. Actually, it's known that the size of the largest antichain equals the width of the partial order. So the maximum concurrency (if we had unlimited workers) is the width. But we are limited by k, so the maximum concurrency we can realize is min(k, width). So the answer is min(k, width). So we just need to compute the width of the partial order represented by the directed graph. But we need to handle cycles: if there's a cycle, there is no starting node, so concurrency 0. But the problem might ask: "If there's a cycle, you cannot schedule any tasks, so output 0." That seems plausible.

Thus, the solution reduces to computing the width of the DAG (size of the maximum antichain). But we also need to consider the possibility that the graph may not be a DAG (may contain cycles). So we need to detect cycles. If there's a cycle, output 0.

Now, how to compute the width of a DAG? The width is the size of the largest set of vertices such that no one is reachable from another. Equivalent to the size of the maximum matching in a bipartite graph constructed from the DAG: there's a theorem known as Dilworth's decomposition theorem: The maximum size of an antichain equals the minimum number of chains that partition the set. But computing maximum antichain can be done via maximum matching in a bipartite graph representation: for each vertex, we create a copy on left and right side, and for each edge u->v, we add an edge from left(u) to right(v). Then the maximum matching size M gives the minimum path cover (minimum number of chains that cover all vertices) as n - M. Then the width of the DAG is the maximum size of an antichain equals the minimum number of chains covering the DAG (Dilworth's theorem). Wait, Dilworth's theorem: In any partially ordered set, the size of the largest antichain equals the minimum number of chains needed to cover the set. So the width = size of largest antichain = minimum number of chains covering the DAG. But the minimum chain cover can be found by a maximum matching on a bipartite graph: The size of the minimum chain cover = n - maxMatching. So the width = n - maxMatching. Actually, check: For DAG, we can create bipartite graph: left side and right side each representing all vertices. For each edge u->v, we add an edge from left(u) to right(v). Then the maximum matching M gives the maximum number of edges that can be used to pair vertices into chains. The size of a minimum path cover (minimum number of vertex-disjoint paths covering all vertices) = n - M. But the minimum path cover is the same as the minimum number of chains needed to cover all vertices in the partial order? Yes, because a path in a DAG corresponds to a chain in the partial order. So the minimum number of chains covering all vertices = n - M. By Dilworth's theorem, the size of the maximum antichain = that minimum number. So the width = n - M. So the maximum concurrency we can get (if unlimited workers) is n - M. But we cannot exceed k. So the answer is min(k, n - M).

But let's test with the DAG we considered earlier: n=5. Let's compute edges for the original orientation: 4->5, 3->4, 5->2, 2->1. Build bipartite edges: left(4)->right(5), left(3)->right(4), left(5)->right(2), left(2)->right(1). Maximum matching: we can match 4->5, 5->2, 3->4? Wait, we can match left(3)->right(4) and left(5)->right(2) and left(2)->right(1). But left(4)->right(5) also? But right(5) already matched to left(5). So we can't match both. So we need to choose edges to maximize number of matched pairs. Let's find a maximum matching: choose left(3)->right(4), left(5)->right(2), left(2)->right(1). That's 3 edges matched. Then left(4)->right(5) cannot match because right(5) is free? Actually, right(5) is free if we didn't match left(5)->right(2)? Wait, we matched left(5)->right(2). That uses left(5) and right(2). So left(4)->right(5) can still match because right(5) is free. But left(4) is not matched yet. So we can add left(4)->right(5). That uses left(4) and right(5). So we have 4 matched edges: left(3)->right(4), left(4)->right(5), left(5)->right(2), left(2)->right(1). That matches 4 edges. But we cannot match left(1) because it has no outgoing edges. So maximum matching M = 4. Then n - M = 5 - 4 = 1. So width = 1. That matches our earlier calculation that the width of the DAG is 1. That seems wrong because we earlier thought width might be 2. But maybe we miscalculated antichains: Actually, let's find an antichain: {1,3,5}? Are they all pairwise incomparable? 1 < 2, 5 < 4, 3 < 4. So 1 is not comparable to 3 because there is no path from 1 to 3 or 3 to 1. 1 < 2, 2 < 5, 5 < 4. So 1 and 5 are comparable? 1 < 2 < 5, so 1 < 5. So 1 and 5 are comparable. So can't be in antichain. 3 and 5: 3 < 4, 5 < 4, but 3 and 5 are not comparable because no path between them. So {3,5} is an antichain. But is 5 comparable to 1? Yes, 1 < 5. So 5 cannot be in antichain with 1. So {3,5} is size 2. But we found width = 1 using the matching approach. Something is off: Our maximum matching M = 4 leads to width = 1. But we found an antichain {3,5} of size 2. So width should be at least 2. So our matching result might be wrong. Let's recompute carefully: The bipartite graph has left side: {1,2,3,4,5} and right side: {1',2',3',4',5'}. For each directed edge u->v, we add an edge from left(u) to right(v). The edges are: left(4)->right(5), left(3)->right(4), left(2)->right(1), left(5)->right(2). Wait, we need to confirm orientation: original edges: 4->5, 3->4, 2->1, 5->4. So edges: (4->5), (3->4), (2->1), (5->4). So we add edges: left(4)->right(5), left(3)->right(4), left(2)->right(1), left(5)->right(4). So we also have left(5)->right(4). So left(3)->right(4) and left(5)->right(4). So we have edges: 4->5, 3->4, 5->4, 2->1. So we can match edges:

- left(3)->right(4) matches 3->4
- left(4)->right(5) matches 4->5
- left(5)->right(4) matches 5->4
- left(2)->right(1) matches 2->1

We need to match each left vertex at most once, each right vertex at most once. So we can try to match 4 edges: left(3)->right(4), left(4)->right(5), left(2)->right(1). We cannot match left(5)->right(4) because right(4) is already matched. So maximum matching M <= 3. Let's find a matching of size 3:

- left(3)->right(4)
- left(4)->right(5)
- left(2)->right(1)

But left(5) remains unmatched. We could match left(5)->right(4) if we didn't match left(3)->right(4). But we could match left(5)->right(4) and left(4)->right(5) and left(2)->right(1) that's 3 edges. So M=3. Then n - M = 5 - 3 = 2. That matches our antichain {3,5} of size 2. So width = 2. So min(k, width) yields min(2,2)=2. That matches the example. So the width of the DAG with these edges is 2. Good.

Thus, the answer is min(k, width). So we just need to compute width = n - maxMatching. And if there's a cycle, output 0.

Now we need to compute maximum matching in a bipartite graph of size 2n. n can be up to 100k, m up to 100k. So the bipartite graph also has at most m edges. We can compute a maximum bipartite matching with Hopcroft–Karp in O(E sqrt(V)) = 100k * sqrt(200k) ~ 100k * 447 ~ 44 million, maybe borderline but fine. Actually, we can implement Hopcroft–Karp.

But we also need to handle cycles. The graph may contain cycles. But we can detect cycle by computing a topological order using Kahn's algorithm. If the graph is not a DAG (i.e., topological sort fails to include all vertices), then answer = 0. Actually, we need to consider if the graph is a DAG but maybe we still cannot start any tasks because all nodes have indegree >0? But if graph has no cycles, we can always find a topological ordering. But some nodes may have no indegree, those are starting nodes. But if all nodes have indegree > 0 due to cycle? If there is a cycle, then we can't start. But if graph is a DAG but all nodes have indegree > 0? That can't happen because a DAG must have at least one node with indegree 0. Because otherwise there's a cycle. So a DAG always has at least one starting node.

Thus, we can just check if graph has cycles: if not all nodes processed by topological sort, answer=0.

Now we need to compute maximum matching. But building bipartite graph may be heavy: we have left side and right side each of size n. But we can store adjacency lists from left to right only. We need to compute maximum matching between left and right.

We can implement Hopcroft–Karp:

- adjacency: for each left vertex u, list of right vertices v that are reachable from u in the DAG (i.e., edges u->v).
- We'll store array pairU[u] for left side match (the right vertex matched to u, or 0 if none).
- We'll store array pairV[v] for right side match (the left vertex matched to v, or 0 if none).
- We'll store distances dist[u] for BFS.
- BFS: for all free left vertices (pairU[u]==0), set dist[u]=0 and enqueue. For matched left vertices, dist[u]=inf. While queue: pop u, for each neighbor v: if pairV[v]!=0 and dist[pairV[v]]==inf: dist[pairV[v]] = dist[u]+1, enqueue pairV[v]. Then we set found = true if we reached free right vertex? Actually, we use BFS to compute levels for unmatched left vertices. We treat edges from left to right, then from right to left via matched edges. Then we BFS to find distances to unmatched right vertices? Actually, standard Hopcroft–Karp uses BFS to find shortest augmenting paths from free left vertices to free right vertices. It uses dist[u] for left vertices only. In BFS, we push free left vertices. For each left vertex u, for each neighbor v: if pairV[v] != 0 and dist[pairV[v]]==INF: dist[pairV[v]] = dist[u]+1 and push pairV[v]. At the end, BFS returns true if we found at least one augmenting path. We also set a sentinel value of dist[0] = INF. In DFS, we recursively try to augment along those levels.

Alternatively, we can use a simpler algorithm: For each left vertex, we can try to find an augmenting path using DFS and visited flags. Complexity O(VE) worst-case but with V=100k, E=100k, that might be too high: 10^10. But maybe average case smaller? But we can implement Hopcroft–Karp properly.

Now, we also need to check if graph has cycles. But we can incorporate cycle detection by performing topological sort and counting processed nodes. But we also need to compute indegree of each vertex. That will be needed anyway for topological sort.

We also need to parse input. Input format: first line contains n and k. Then next n lines: each line describes adjacency list of node i: maybe first number is number of neighbors, then the neighbors? But the problem statement didn't give that. It might be a typical representation: each line begins with the number of outgoing edges, then the list of adjacent vertices. But we need to confirm by reading the problem statement carefully: It says "In the following n lines, there is an adjacency list for each node of the graph." It doesn't specify the format. But typical adjacency list representation: each line starts with the number of neighbors, then the list. Or each line lists neighbors separated by spaces until maybe -1 sentinel? But the problem statement didn't mention sentinel. But perhaps each line starts with number of neighbors? Many problems from e-olymp use that.

Let's search for similar tasks: Many e-olymp tasks: "The maximum concurrency is 2" etc. This might be from an e-olymp contest. Typically, e-olymp tasks provide adjacency list format: Each of the following n lines contains first an integer t_i specifying the number of neighbors, then t_i integers describing the adjacency list. So we can parse that. But we need to verify if the test input is of that format. Because the problem statement didn't show the actual input values. But we can assume typical format.

Now, what about the graph being directed? It is a directed graph of n vertices with adjacency lists. We need to compute edges accordingly. We'll parse each line: first integer is the number of neighbors (adjacent vertices) that the current vertex has outgoing edges to. Then we read those neighbors. That forms edges from current vertex to those neighbors.

Now, we need to compute width. The algorithm:

- Build adjacency lists (directed edges).
- Compute indegree for each vertex.
- Perform Kahn's topological sort. While queue non-empty, pop u, for each v in adjacency[u], decrement indegree[v], if becomes 0, push v. Count processed nodes. At the end, if processed nodes < n, graph has cycle => answer=0. Actually, we also might need to compute the order. But for maximum matching, we need edges from left to right. But we can just build adjacency and then build bipartite edges accordingly.

- Build bipartite adjacency lists: For each directed edge u->v, add an edge from left side u to right side v. Use adjacency list leftAdj[u] storing neighbors v. That is just adjacency list itself. But we also need to differentiate left and right sets. We can keep them in same indexing: left index 1..n, right index 1..n. We'll store pairV[v] for right side vertices.

- Compute maximum matching M via Hopcroft–Karp.

- Compute width = n - M.

- Compute answer = min(k, width). Actually, if graph has cycle, answer=0. But if graph is DAG, answer = min(k, width). But is that always correct? Let's test with a simple graph: no edges, n=5, k=3. Then width = n - M. M=0 because no edges. So width=5. So answer = min(3,5)=3. That means we can run 3 tasks concurrently because we have unlimited workers? Actually, we have k=3, so we can run at most 3 tasks concurrently. So answer 3. That matches.

- Another test: a linear chain 1->2->3->4->5, n=5. M=4 because we can match edges (1->2),(2->3),(3->4),(4->5). Then width = n-M=1. So answer = min(k,1). So concurrency=1. That matches the chain scenario: no parallel tasks.

- Another test: 2 independent chains: 1->2, 3->4, and vertex 5 isolated. n=5, edges: 1->2, 3->4. M=2? Actually, edges: left(1)->right(2), left(3)->right(4). M=2. width = 5-2=3. Those 3 tasks (1,3,5) can start concurrently. If k=2, answer=2. If k=3, answer=3. That matches.

- Another test: 2 independent nodes with no edges: n=2, no edges. M=0, width=2, answer min(k,2).

- Another test: some cycle: 1->2->3->1 plus maybe other edges. Kahn's will detect cycle => answer 0.

Thus, algorithm seems correct.

Now, we need to implement Hopcroft–Karp for n up to 100k, edges up to 100k. BFS and DFS operations O(E sqrt(V)). We'll implement as adjacency list leftAdj[u] storing v neighbors.

We need to maintain arrays:

- pairU: vector<int> of size n+1 (left side).
- pairV: vector<int> of size n+1 (right side).
- dist: vector<int> of size n+1.

Implementation of Hopcroft–Karp:

```
function BFS:
  queue<int> Q;
  for u in 1..n:
    if pairU[u]==0:
      dist[u]=0;
      Q.push(u);
    else:
      dist[u]=INF;
  dist[0]=INF;
  while !Q.empty():
    u=Q.front(); Q.pop();
    if dist[u]<dist[0]:
      for v in leftAdj[u]:
        if dist[pairV[v]]==INF:
          dist[pairV[v]] = dist[u]+1;
          Q.push(pairV[v]);
  return dist[0]!=INF;
```

But pairV[0] is sentinel.

Wait, we need to handle sentinel pairU[0] and pairV[0] perhaps.

In DFS:

```
function DFS(u):
  if u!=0:
    for v in leftAdj[u]:
      if dist[pairV[v]]==dist[u]+1:
        if DFS(pairV[v]):
          pairV[v] = u;
          pairU[u] = v;
          return true;
    dist[u] = INF;
    return false;
  return true;
```

The algorithm uses pairU and pairV. But we need to consider that the sentinel 0 is a free right vertex. But we need to set dist[0] properly. In BFS, we set dist[0] = INF. Actually, we use dist[u] for left vertices. But we also treat pairV[v] as left vertex matched to v. So we push matched left vertices into BFS.

But we need to implement careful. Implementation details: We'll use 1-indexed vertices. We'll use pairU[0] and pairV[0] as sentinel. Distances will be int.

Now, we need to ensure that we allocate leftAdj list for each left vertex. We can reuse adjacency list itself. But we need to build edges from left to right. We can just store adjacency for each left vertex. But we also need to iterate neighbor v. That's exactly the adjacency list of u. So we can reuse adjacency[u] as left adjacency. But we also need to store pairV[v] mapping from right vertex to left matched. So pairV will be array of size n+1.

Thus, we can implement Hopcroft–Karp using adjacency of left side.

Now, we also need to compute maximum matching size. We can compute M by counting matched pairs pairU[u]!=0.

We also need to handle memory: adjacency lists of n vertices and m edges, each as vector<int>. That is fine.

Time complexity: Topological sort O(n+m). Hopcroft–Karp O(m sqrt(n)). For n=100k, m=100k, sqrt(200k)=447, so operations ~ 44 million, which is fine.

But we also need to detect cycle. We can just use topological sort.

Now, we also need to parse input lines. For each node i, we need to read adjacency list. We need to handle potential spaces. We'll read whole line as string, then use stringstream to parse ints. The first number is maybe the number of neighbors. But we need to confirm if there is any sentinel like 0 or -1 at end? But typical e-olymp tasks: each line: "t_i v1 v2 ... v_t". So we parse accordingly.

We also need to handle reading large input quickly: use fast IO.

Now, we need to implement in C++17.

Edge case: n=0? But n is at least 1.

Now, let's test with the example: n=7, k=2. The graph is as described earlier with edges: 1->3,1->4,2->3,3->5,3->6,4->7,5->7,6->7. Actually, adjacency: 1: 3 4; 2: 3; 3:5 6; 4:7; 5:7; 6:7; 7: none. We compute indegree: indegree[3]=2, indegree[4]=1, indegree[5]=1, indegree[6]=1, indegree[7]=3, indegree[1]=0, indegree[2]=0. Topological sort yields order [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] maybe. Graph is DAG. Build bipartite adjacency: edges left->right accordingly. Hopcroft–Karp: we can match (1->3),(1->4),(2->3),(3->5),(3->6),(4->7),(5->7),(6->7). Wait, we only add edges from left to right: we need to consider all edges. But we cannot match left(1) to both right 3 and right 4. We need to find maximum matching. For edges:

Left 1: neighbors {3,4}
Left 2: neighbor {3}
Left 3: neighbors {5,6}
Left 4: neighbor {7}
Left 5: neighbor {7}
Left 6: neighbor {7}
Left 7: no neighbors.

Maximum matching M: we can match left 1->4, left 2->3, left 3->5, left 4->7? Wait, we can't match left 4->7 if right 7 is already matched. Actually, we can match left 1->4, left 2->3, left 3->5. Now right 7 remains free. We can also match left 4->7. But left 4 is matched? Actually, left 4 currently free. We can match left 4->7. But that uses right 7. But left 5 and left 6 also have neighbor 7 but they can't be matched because right 7 is matched. So M=4? Actually, we can match edges: left 1->4, left 2->3, left 3->5, left 4->7. That gives M=4. Then width = n-M = 7-4 = 3. But earlier we found width=2? Wait, we mis counted. Let's compute M more carefully: The bipartite graph edges: left->right edges: 1->{3,4}, 2->{3}, 3->{5,6}, 4->{7}, 5->{7}, 6->{7}. We need to find maximum matching between left vertices 1-7 and right vertices 1-7. We can match left 1->4, left 2->3, left 3->5, left 4->7. That uses right 4,3,5,7. But left 5,6 are unmatched. So M=4. width = 7-4=3. So concurrency= min(k,3). But earlier we said concurrency=2. But we need to verify actual graph concurrency: We had a chain 1->3->5->7 and another chain 2->3->6->7. But in this graph, there is a cycle: 3->5, 5->7, 7? Actually, 7 no outgoing edges. So no cycle. But we have edges: 1->3, 1->4, 2->3, 3->5, 3->6, 4->7, 5->7, 6->7. That is a DAG. Let's compute concurrency: At time 0, tasks 1 and 2 are ready. They can run concurrently. After 1 completes, it releases 3 and 4. But 3 is already released by 2? Wait, 2->3 also releases 3. So 3 may have two incoming edges, but we need both prerequisites? But in graph, 3 has indegree from 1 and 2. So 3 cannot start until both 1 and 2 finish. So concurrency 1: tasks 1 and 2 only concurrently. After 1 completes, 4 may start but 4's indegree is from 1, so it can start immediately after 1 completes. But at that time, 2 may still be running. So concurrency: tasks 1 and 2 at time 0. Then maybe tasks 1,2 concurrently until 1 completes. Then at time 1, 1 completes, tasks 2 still running, and 4 can start concurrently. So concurrency 2 at time 1. Meanwhile, 3 cannot start because 2 hasn't finished yet. After 2 finishes, 3 can start. But then 4 may finish earlier, but concurrency remains at 2 at some times. So maximum concurrency is indeed 2. So concurrency 2 < width 3? But width 3 would mean 3 tasks ready at some time. But is there any time when 3 tasks are ready? Let's examine: At start, ready tasks: 1,2 only. So concurrency 2. After 1 completes, 4 is ready. So tasks 2 and 4 concurrently. After 2 completes, 3 becomes ready, but 1 also completed earlier. At that time, tasks 3 may start, but 4 may already finished. So concurrency maybe 2 at some times. There is no time when 3 tasks ready. Because 3 needs both 1 and 2 finished. 4 only depends on 1, so after 1 finishes 4 can run, but 2 may still be running. But 3 cannot start until both finished. So concurrency 2 is max. So concurrency 2. So width 3 seems too high. Let's analyze width calculation: We found width 3 using matching M=4. But we think concurrency maximum 2. So why width 3? Let's compute width properly. Width is the size of a maximum antichain. In DAG with edges above, maybe width > 2? Let's check partial order. We need to compute partial order of tasks. Actually, we need to derive the partial order from graph? Graph edges represent precedence constraints: u->v means u is predecessor of v. So partial order: if there is a path from u to v, then u must be before v. But if there is no path from u to v, they can be concurrent. But width is the size of a maximum set of tasks with no path between any two of them. But the graph edges are a partial order. But we need to compute width of this partial order.

We need to find a set of vertices that form an antichain. In this graph, tasks 1 and 2 have no path between them. So they form antichain of size 2. Could we add any other vertex to antichain? Let's see. 4 is reachable from 1, so there is a path from 1 to 4. So 1 and 4 cannot both be in antichain. 3 is reachable from 1 and 2, so there is a path from 1 to 3 and from 2 to 3. So 1 and 3 cannot be in antichain. 5 is reachable from 1->3->5. So 1->5. So 1 and 5 cannot be antichain. Similarly for 2->3->5 etc. So 2 and 5 also path. 6 reachable from 1->3->6. So 1 and 6 cannot. 2 and 6 cannot? Wait, 2->3->6 path? Yes, 2->3->6. So 2 and 6 cannot. 4 and 7: 4->7. So 4 and 7 cannot. 5 and 7: 5->7. So 5 and 7 cannot. 6 and 7 cannot. 3 and 7: 3->5->7? So 3->5->7. So 3 and 7 cannot. So basically, any pair with a path cannot be antichain. So the only antichains are sets of vertices such that no one is reachable from another. Let's check antichain {1,2,4}? There is path 1->4, so no. {1,2,5}? Path 1->3->5 and 2->3->5? Actually, 5 is reachable from 3, which is reachable from both 1 and 2. So 1->3->5, 2->3->5. So 5 reachable from 1 and 2, so there is path from 1 to 5? Yes. So 1 and 5 cannot. So {1,2} is antichain size 2. {1,2,6}? 2->3->6, so 2 and 6 cannot. {2,4,5}? 2->3->5? Actually, 5 reachable from 3, which reachable from 2, so path from 2 to 5. So 2 and 5 cannot. {3,4}? Path 1->3,1->4? 3 and 4 both reachable from 1, but no path between 3 and 4. But 3->? 3 not connected to 4? No. 4->? 4->7. 3->? 3->5,6. So no path between 3 and 4. So {3,4} is antichain? But 3 has indegree from 1 and 2, 4 from 1. So 3 depends on 1 and 2, but 4 depends only on 1. But partial order path: 1->3, 1->4. So there is path 1->3 and 1->4. But 3 and 4 no direct path. So antichain. But we can't have them concurrently because they require 1's completion. But antichain property does not guarantee concurrency, because they both might need prerequisites that are not satisfied concurrently. Actually, in partial order concurrency, tasks in an antichain can potentially run concurrently if prerequisites are satisfied. But here, 3 requires 1 and 2. So at time 0, only 1 and 2 can run. So antichain {1,2} of size 2 is indeed concurrent. But {3,4} is antichain of size 2 but they cannot run concurrently because 3 not ready until 2 finishes, etc. So width computed by antichain ignoring prerequisites might not reflect concurrency. Wait, concurrency measure is maximum size of a set of tasks that can be executed simultaneously while respecting all precedence constraints. This is equivalent to the maximum size of a set of vertices such that no vertex is an ancestor of another (i.e., no directed path between them) AND all prerequisites of each are satisfied by the set of tasks that finished before them. Actually, concurrency might require some tasks to wait for others.

But the maximum concurrency in DAG scheduling with infinite parallelism and no resource constraints is indeed the width of the poset (size of largest antichain). However, in our graph, width might be 3? Let's re-evaluate the graph to see if concurrency could be 3. Consider tasks 1,2 at time 0. They run concurrently. At time 0, no other tasks ready. After 1 finishes, tasks 2 still running. 4 becomes ready. So concurrency at time 1: tasks 2 and 4. 3 cannot start because 2 still running. At time 1, 4 may finish. At time 2, 2 finishes. Then 3 can start. 4 finished earlier, so concurrency maybe 2: tasks 3 only? Actually, after 2 finishes at time 2, tasks 3 and maybe 4? 4 finished at time 1. So concurrency at time 2: only task 3. So max concurrency 2. So width 3 predicted concurrency 3 is wrong.

So width 3 can't be achieved. So maybe width computed by maximum antichain formula is wrong? Let's find the maximum antichain in this DAG.

We need to find a set of vertices such that no one can reach another. In this DAG, vertices: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Edges: 1->3,1->4,2->3,3->5,3->6,4->7,5->7,6->7.

Paths: 1->3->5->7, 1->3->6->7, 2->3->5->7, 2->3->6->7. So partial order includes transitive edges: 1->5 (via 3), 1->6, 1->7, 2->5,2->6,2->7, 3->7 (via 5 or 6), etc. So transitive closure includes 1->7,2->7,3->7. So 3 has two incoming edges, but can only start after both 1 and 2 finish. So partial order path between any pair includes transitive closure.

Thus, the poset includes edges: 1<3,1<4,2<3,3<5,3<6,4<7,5<7,6<7, plus transitive: 1<5,1<6,1<7,2<5,2<6,2<7,3<7. So the partial order is not a simple chain.

Now find largest antichain: For an antichain, no two vertices have comparability. So we need set of vertices with no path between them.

Check antichain {1,2,4}? 1<4, so 1 and 4 comparable, so cannot. {1,2,5}? 1<5 via 3, so cannot. {1,2,6}? 1<6, cannot. {1,2,7}? 1<7 via 4 or 5 or 6, so cannot. So any antichain including 1 cannot include 4,5,6,7,3 (since 1<3,4<7 etc). But antichain {1,2} is fine. {1,2} of size 2. Could we include 3 in antichain? 1<3,2<3, so 3 comparable with both, so no. Could we include 4? 1<4, so no. So {1,2} is max antichain.

Could we have antichain not including 1? e.g., {3,4,5}? 3<5 via 5? Actually 3<5, so cannot. {3,4,6}? 3 and 4 no comparability? 1<3 and 1<4, but no path 3<4 or 4<3. So {3,4} is antichain of size 2. Could we add 5? 3<5, so cannot. Add 6? 3<6, cannot. Add 7? 4<7 and 5<7,6<7. So 4 and 7 comparable, cannot. So {3,4} size 2. Could we add 1? No. So any antichain size >2 seems impossible? Let's test {3,4,6}. 3<6, so no. {3,4,5}? 3<5, no. {3,4,2}? 2<3, no. {3,4,1}? 1<3, no. So {3,4} is maximum size 2.

Thus width is 2. Good. So width = 2. So M computed by bipartite matching should give M = n - width = 7-2 = 5. But we found M=4. So we mis-constructed the bipartite graph? Let's double-check the matching we found earlier. We had matching pairs: (1->3),(2->5),(3->7),(4->7)? Actually we used 3 edges: (1->3),(2->5),(3->7) plus we used 4->7? Wait, we found 4 edges: (1->3),(2->5),(3->7),(4->7). But (4->7) uses 4->7. But 4->7? yes. But 4->7 uses 4->7. So we matched 4 left nodes: 1,2,3,4. Right nodes matched: 3,5,7,7? Wait, 7 used twice, not allowed. But we matched (3->7) and (4->7) both to 7 on right. That violates matching uniqueness. We cannot match two left nodes to the same right node. So that is invalid. We must avoid that. So maybe we can't match both 3->7 and 4->7. So we need to adjust matching.

Let's find a maximum matching properly. Let's try to find maximum matching with distinct right nodes. Right side nodes: {3,4,5,6,7}. We can match left nodes to distinct right nodes:

- left 1 -> choose right 4 (edge 1->4).
- left 2 -> choose right 5 (edge 2->5).
- left 3 -> choose right 6? But 3->6 edge exists, so match left 3 -> right 6.
- left 4 -> choose right 7? But right 7 not yet matched, so match left 4 -> right 7.
- left 5 -> cannot match to any distinct right because 5->? no edges to 7? Actually 5->7 but 7 already matched. So cannot.
- left 6 -> cannot match because 6->? no edges to 7? Actually 6->7 but 7 matched. So cannot.
- left 7 -> no outgoing edges.

So we matched 4 edges: (1->4),(2->5),(3->6),(4->7). So matching size M = 4. Then width = n - M = 7 - 4 = 3. But we found width=2. But wait, we matched 4 edges: left 1 matched to right 4. But that uses edge 1->4. But left 1 also has edge to 3. We didn't match that. But we matched 2->5. 3->6. 4->7. This is a matching of size 4. But is this a maximum matching? Let's try to see if we can increase matching by matching left 1->3 instead? Then left 1->3. left 2->5. left 3->7? left 4->? left 4 cannot match to any distinct right because 4->7 but 7 matched by 3->7? Actually 3->7 matched, so 4 cannot match to 7. But maybe we can match left 1->4, left 2->3, left 3->5, left 4->7? Let's attempt: 
- 1->4
- 2->3
- 3->5
- 4->7

This uses edges distinct: right nodes matched: 4,3,5,7. That's also size 4. But we can't match 3->6 because right 6 not used yet. But 3->6 would conflict with left 3 matched to right 5. But maybe we can match 3->6 instead of 3->5. Then left 3->6. Then left 4->? 4->7. So we have edges: 1->4,2->3,3->6,4->7. This matches right nodes 4,3,6,7. All distinct. That also size 4. But we cannot match 5 because 5 has no outgoing edges.

Thus maximum matching size M = 4. Then width = 7 - 4 = 3. But we found maximum antichain size = 2? But we might have mis-evaluated antichain. Let's find an antichain of size 3. Could be {1,4,6}? 1<4, so no. {1,5,6}? 1<5 and 1<6, so no. {2,4,5}? 2<5, so no. {3,4,5}? 4<7,3<7? But 3 and 4 have no comparability? Actually, 3 and 4 no path between them. 3<5? 3<5, so 3 and 5 comparable. So no. {3,4,2}? 2<3, so no. {3,4,1}? 1<4, no. {3,4,6}? 3<6? Actually, 3->6, so 3 and 6 comparable. So no. {3,4,7}? 3<7? Yes, 3->7. So no. {4,5,6}? 4->7,5->7,6->7, no comparability between 4,5,6? 4 and 5? No path between 4 and 5. 4->? 4->7. 5->? 5->7. But no direct path 4->5 or 5->4. So 4 and 5 comparable? Actually, no. 4 and 6? no. 5 and 6? no. So {4,5,6} might be an antichain. Are there any paths between 4 and 5? No. 4 and 5 both have no path between them. 5 and 6? no. 4 and 6? no. So {4,5,6} is an antichain of size 3. But can tasks 4,5,6 run concurrently? Let's examine schedule: 
- Initially ready tasks: 1,2 (since no prerequisites).
- After 1 finishes, 4 becomes ready.
- After 1 and 2 finish, 3 becomes ready (but 3 has edges to 5 and 6). But 3 needs both 1 and 2. So if 1 finishes first, then 4 can run concurrently with 2. But 5 and 6 are not ready until 3 finishes. So tasks 4,5,6 cannot be ready simultaneously. But antichain property does not require that all tasks in antichain are ready at the same time. It just means no two tasks in the antichain have precedence relations. But to run tasks concurrently, each task must have all its prerequisites finished. But if we consider tasks 4,5,6: 
- 4 requires 1.
- 5 requires 3, which requires 1 and 2.
- 6 requires 3, which requires 1 and 2.
So at time 0, tasks 4,5,6 cannot run because 5,6 require 3. So concurrency maybe can't involve 5,6 concurrently. But can we run 4,5,6 concurrently? Only if 1 and 2 finished. But then 3 will also finish? Actually, we need to schedule tasks in a sequence that respects precedence. But concurrency measure is maximum number of tasks that can be executed simultaneously at any point in a schedule. The schedule can be chosen to maximize concurrency. But if we want to schedule 4,5,6 concurrently, we would need to have them ready concurrently. But 5 and 6 require 3. 3 requires 1 and 2. So if we finish 1 and 2, then 3 becomes ready. Then 3 can run, then 5 and 6 become ready. But 5 and 6 cannot run until 3 finishes. So 5 and 6 cannot be ready concurrently with 4 at the same time. So maybe we cannot schedule 4,5,6 concurrently. So width remains 2.

Thus the matching approach might not yield width for this partial order because of the partial order being transitive. Wait, but the bipartite graph we built includes edges from each node to all nodes that follow it. This includes edges from left 1 to right 3, left 2 to right 3, etc. But we only used some edges.

But the theorem that width = n - maximum matching size is only true for comparability graphs? Actually, there is a known algorithm: width of partial order = n - size of maximum chain decomposition? Wait, I'm mixing up with Dilworth's theorem: In any partial order, the maximum size of a chain *times* the minimum number of chains that cover the set is at least n. Actually, the statement: width * chain decomposition size = n? Wait, let's recall:

Dilworth's theorem: In any finite partially ordered set, the maximum size of an antichain equals the minimum number of chains needed to cover the set.

Chain cover: a set of chains such that each element of the poset belongs to exactly one chain. We want to find a chain decomposition covering all elements such that each element appears in exactly one chain. Then the minimum number of chains needed to cover the set is the size of a maximum antichain. Actually, no, the minimum number of chains needed equals the size of a maximum antichain. Wait, check: In a poset, the width equals the minimum number of chains needed to cover the poset. So we want to find a chain cover of minimal size. The size of that chain cover equals width. But chain cover uses chains that may share elements? Actually, chain cover means each element appears in exactly one chain (no sharing). So you partition the set into chains. And the minimum number of chains needed equals the width. Yes. That's Dilworth. But we need to find chain decomposition, not maximum matching. But chain cover can be found via maximum matching in a bipartite graph representation of the poset: The poset's comparability graph is transformed into a bipartite graph (poset DAG). The maximum matching size is equal to n - minimum chain cover. Because you can pair up adjacent elements in chains, reducing chain count.

Specifically, consider the directed acyclic graph of the poset. We create a bipartite graph with left part containing all nodes, right part containing all nodes. For each directed edge u -> v in the poset, we create an edge (u_left, v_right). Then the size of a minimum chain cover = n - size of maximum matching in this bipartite graph. This is a known algorithm: chain decomposition can be derived from maximum matching in a comparability graph.

So the chain cover number = n - M. So width = minimum chain cover? Wait, check: The width is the maximum size of an antichain. But Dilworth: width = minimum number of chains needed to cover the set. Yes, width = min chain cover. So we need to find min chain cover, which is n - maximum matching. So width = n - M. So for this poset, if M = 4, width = 7-4 = 3. But we found width=2. So something wrong. Let's find maximum matching again to verify.

We need to find a maximum matching between left nodes and right nodes. Let's try to find a matching of size 5.

We need to match 5 distinct left nodes to 5 distinct right nodes. Left nodes that have outgoing edges: 1,2,3,4,5,6. Actually 5 and 6 have no outgoing edges, but left 5 and 6 can be matched? Wait, left 5 has outgoing edges? 5->? 5->7? But 7 is on right. So left 5 can match to right 7. But left 4 also matches to right 7. So conflict. But we might choose left 5 to match to right 7 and left 4 cannot match to any other. But we can match left 1->4, left 2->5, left 3->6, left 4->7? Then left 5 cannot match because right 7 already matched. So M=4.

But maybe we can match left 2->3, left 1->4, left 3->5, left 5->7? Wait, left 5->7 is an edge. Right 7 not matched yet. So left 5->7. Then left 4->? left 4 can match to right 7? But 7 already matched by 5->7. So left 4 cannot match. So M=4.

We cannot match left 3->6 and left 5->? left 5 cannot match because right 7 matched? Actually we might match left 1->4, left 2->5, left 3->6, left 5->7, left 4 cannot match because 7 used. So M=4.

We cannot get M=5 because we only have 5 right nodes but some right nodes have limited edges: 3 has edges from 1,2. 4 from 1. 5 from 2. 6 from 3. 7 from 3,4,5,6. So we cannot assign 7 to more than one left. We have 4 edges that can use distinct right nodes, but we cannot match all 5 left nodes because there are only 5 right nodes. But we can try to match left 1->3, left 2->5, left 3->6, left 4->7? Then we use right 3,5,6,7. That's 4 edges. We cannot match left 5->7 because 7 used by 4->7. So M=4.

So maximum matching M=4. Then width = n - M = 7 - 4 = 3. But we found antichain of size 3: {4,5,6}. But earlier we considered tasks 4,5,6 cannot run concurrently because 5 and 6 require 3. But antichain does not require concurrency. But the question's "maximum number of tasks that can be executed at any instant" refers to concurrency of a schedule that respects partial order. So we can schedule tasks 4,5,6 concurrently? No. But maybe we can schedule tasks 4,5,6 concurrently by first completing 1 and 2, then tasks 4 and 3 are ready, then we run 4 and 3 concurrently, then after 3 finishes, 5 and 6 become ready, but they would not run concurrently with 4. So we cannot run 4,5,6 concurrently. But we can run 4 and 5 concurrently? 5 requires 3, 3 requires 2. But 2 hasn't finished? We can schedule 2 concurrently with 4? 4 requires 1. So if we finish 1, we can run 4 concurrently with 2. But 5 requires 3, which requires 2. So 5 cannot be ready until 3 finishes, so 5 cannot be run concurrently with 4 if 2 hasn't finished? Actually, if we finish 1, we can run 4 concurrently with 2. Then 2 finishes, 3 becomes ready, then we run 3 concurrently with maybe some other tasks? But 3 only has edges to 5 and 6, so after 3 finishes, 5 and 6 become ready. But by that time, 4 has already finished. So we cannot run 4,5,6 concurrently at any instant. So concurrency maximum = 2.

Thus the chain decomposition approach with maximum matching gave width=3 incorrectly. But why? Because we used a wrong comparability graph? Actually, the partial order includes all transitive edges. But our bipartite graph considered only direct edges, not transitive closure. But maximum matching algorithm for chain decomposition requires using the comparability graph with all comparabilities, including transitive edges. Let's consider adding transitive edges: edges from 1->5? 1->3, 3->5, so 1<5. So add edge (1->5). Also 1->6? 1->3,3->6 so 1<6. 2->3? 2->3? 2->3 is given? No, 2->3 is not an edge in the DAG, but 2<3? 2->3 is not given. But 2<3? 2->3 is not present. So no. But 2->6? 2->3,3->6: 2<6. So add edge (2->6). 3->7? 3->7 direct. 2->7? 2->5,5->7, so 2<7. Add edge (2->7). 1->7? 1->3,3->7, so 1<7. Add (1->7). 1->5? already. 1->6? 1<6. 4->? 4->7. 5->? 5->7. 6->? 6->7. So we have many edges. Let's list all comparabilities:

Left nodes: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
Right nodes: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7

Edges for left 1: to 3,4,5,6,7? 1->3, 1->4, 1->5,1->6,1->7. Actually 1->5,6,7 included as transitive.
Left 2: to 3? no. to 5,6,7? 2->5,2->6,2->7. 2->3? no. 2->4? no. 2->? 2->? Actually 2->3 not. So edges left 2: to 5,6,7.
Left 3: to 5? no. to 6? 3->6 direct. to 7? 3->7 direct.
Left 4: to 7? 4->7 direct.
Left 5: to 7? 5->7 direct.
Left 6: to 7? 6->7 direct.

Now we consider maximum matching. Right nodes have many edges. Let's attempt to match all left nodes to distinct right nodes.

We need distinct right nodes. We can try to match left 1->3, left 2->5, left 3->6, left 4->7, left 5 cannot match? left 5->? Right 7 used? But left 5 could match to right 7 if we didn't match left 4->7. But we matched left 4->7. But we could change match: maybe left 4 cannot match anywhere else. So left 4 will take 7. That means left 5 cannot match. But we can try to use other edges: left 5->? 5->7 only. So if 7 used by left 4, left 5 cannot match. So we cannot use left 5 at all. But we can try to match left 2->7 instead, left 4 cannot match? Wait, left 4->7. So left 4 is only edge to 7. So left 4 will always match to 7. So left 5 cannot match because 7 used. So we cannot match left 5 or left 6? left 6->7 as well. So left 5 and 6 cannot match distinct right. But we have 5 right nodes: 3,4,5,6,7. We can match left 1->3, left 2->5, left 3->6, left 4->7, and left 5? cannot. So we matched 4 left nodes. M=4. So width = 7-4 = 3 again.

But chain decomposition algorithm might produce 3 chains: e.g., chain cover could be [1-3-6-7], [2-5-7]? Wait, but 7 can't appear in two chains. Actually chain cover requires partition into chains. So we need to cover all 7 nodes with minimal number of chains. But we can do chain cover with 3 chains: maybe [1-3-6-7], [2-5-7], [4-7]? But 7 appears in 3 chains, not allowed. So we need to partition such that each node appears in exactly one chain. So maybe [1-3-6-7], [2-5], [4], [7]? Wait, but 7 appears in chain [1-3-6-7]. 2-5 cannot connect to 7 because 5->7. So 2-5-7 chain: but 7 appears in that chain too. That would duplicate 7. So not allowed. So chain decomposition must partition nodes. So we can choose chain [1-3-6-7], [2-5], [4], [7] would duplicate 7 in two chains? Actually, 7 is in chain [1-3-6-7] only. But then we cannot include 7 in any other chain. So chain [2-5] doesn't include 7, so it's okay. Chain [4] includes only 4. Then we need to include 2 and 5 as part of chain [2-5], that covers them. So we have 3 chains: [1-3-6-7], [2-5], [4]. That covers all 7 nodes? Actually we didn't include node 2? Wait, chain [2-5] includes 2 and 5. So yes. Node 6 is in chain [1-3-6-7]. Node 7 also in that chain. Node 4 is separate. So we have 3 chains. So chain cover size=3. So width=3? But we found concurrency=2. So what is wrong? Wait, the chain cover is [1-3-6-7], [2-5], [4]. That uses 3 chains. But maximum antichain size? Let's find antichain: {2,4}. Are there any other antichain bigger? Let's check: 4 is not comparable with 2. But 4 is comparable with 1? 1<4. So 4 cannot be in antichain with 1. 2 not comparable with 1, but 2 <5 and 2 <7 and 2<6. 2 not comparable with 3? 2->3? No. So 2 and 4 are incomparable. 2 and 5? 2<5? Yes, 2<5. So cannot both. 2 and 6? 2<6, so no. 2 and 3? Not comparable. Actually 2<3? no. So 2 and 3 are incomparable. So we could choose {2,3,4}? But 2 and 3 are incomparable? They are not comparable because there's no path from 2 to 3. So 2 and 3 are incomparable. 3 is comparable with 4? 3>4? No. 4<3? 4->? 4->? There's no path from 4 to 3. So 3 and 4 are incomparable. So {2,3,4} is an antichain of size 3. That matches width=3. So indeed the maximum antichain is size 3. But concurrency? The answer says 2. Wait, but if there is antichain of size 3, can we schedule those 3 concurrently? Let's check: {2,3,4} are pairwise incomparable: 2 is not comparable to 3 or 4. 3 is not comparable to 4. 2 is not comparable to 3 or 4. So you can schedule 2,3,4 concurrently because there is no precedence relation among them. But can you schedule them concurrently? Yes, if the partial order only imposes that 1->3 and 1->4. That means 1 must finish before 3 and 4. And 3->5,3->6. 5->7,6->7,4->7. But 2 has no relation to 1,3,4. So 2 is independent of 1,3,4. So at time 0, 2 is ready. But 3 and 4 are not ready because they depend on 1. So we cannot start 3 and 4 until 1 finishes. So you cannot schedule 2,3,4 concurrently at time 0. So concurrency may be less.

However, consider schedule: Initially, 1 and 2 are ready. So we schedule 1 and 2 concurrently. After 1 and 2 finish, 3 and 4 become ready. We can schedule 3 and 4 concurrently. After that, 5 and 6 become ready. We can schedule 5 and 6 concurrently. After that, 7 becomes ready. So at no point more than 2 tasks. So concurrency=2. So width seems 2. But we found antichain {2,3,4} of size 3, but we cannot schedule them concurrently because of precedence constraints: 1 must finish before 3 and 4, but 1 is not in that set. However, you cannot schedule 3 and 4 concurrently if 1 hasn't finished. But at a later time, 1 has finished. But 2 is also finished, so 3 and 4 can run concurrently at that time. But we want to consider the maximum number at any instant over the entire schedule. We can schedule 3 and 4 concurrently after 1 is done. That yields 2 tasks. But we cannot schedule 2 concurrently with 3 and 4 because 2 does not depend on 1, so it could be done early. But if we do 2 early, it doesn't help. So maximum concurrency=2.

Thus width=2, not 3. So the antichain {2,3,4} can't be scheduled concurrently because 1 must finish before 3 and 4. So the antichain concept doesn't reflect concurrency in the DAG? Wait, but partial order says 2 and 3 are incomparable, 2 and 4 are incomparable, 3 and 4 are incomparable. So an antichain is {2,3,4}. But to schedule them concurrently, you need to ensure that all dependencies for each are satisfied. For 3 and 4, dependencies 1 and 3,4 are not satisfied until 1 finishes. But 1 is not in the antichain. So you can't start 3 and 4 until 1 is done. So maybe the concurrency is limited by the presence of nodes that must come before many in the antichain. But width concept doesn't account for that? Wait, width is maximum size of a set of pairwise incomparable elements. But that doesn't guarantee that all of them can be ready simultaneously at some time because there may be some other elements that must be completed before them. However, in a topological ordering, you can schedule the width number tasks concurrently if you schedule all other prerequisites before starting them. But if there is a node like 1 that must be done before 3 and 4, but 1 is not in the set, you still need to finish 1 before you can start 3 and 4. But you can schedule 3 and 4 concurrently after 1 is done. So concurrency may require scheduling the prerequisites before them. So at that time, you can schedule 3 and 4 concurrently. But you also have 2 which can be scheduled early. But at that time, 2 has finished. So concurrency is 2.

So width concept may overestimate concurrency if the DAG has a "source" that must finish before many tasks in the antichain. But you can schedule antichain tasks in stages, each stage may involve only some of them concurrently because others may depend on some earlier tasks that are not in the set.

Hence, concurrency may be less than width. So we need a different measure: the maximum number of tasks that can be started at once while all prerequisites are satisfied. That's essentially the maximum cardinality of an antichain of tasks that are simultaneously ready. But this is the same as the maximum size of an antichain that is also a "antichain of sinks"? Actually, the set of ready tasks at any time are those whose prerequisites have all been completed. At time 0, the set of ready tasks is the set of source nodes (no prerequisites). So concurrency is at most the number of source nodes. Then after finishing some tasks, some new tasks become ready. So concurrency may change. We need to find the maximum concurrency across the schedule. This is equivalent to the maximum size of a set of tasks such that there's no dependency between any pair, and also no dependency from any other tasks that have not been scheduled yet? Actually, it's like we want to find the largest antichain of nodes that can be scheduled concurrently given that all dependencies are satisfied by tasks scheduled earlier. This is the concept of parallelism in a DAG. It's known as the maximum number of tasks that can be executed in parallel if we can schedule tasks as soon as possible. It's basically the maximum width of the DAG in the sense of "parallelism" or "branching factor" perhaps. It's also called the maximum number of tasks that can be scheduled concurrently if we have unlimited processors.

This is known as the "parallelism number" or "maximum number of tasks that can be executed concurrently" given a partial order. It's the maximum size of a set of tasks that are pairwise incomparable and have no dependencies among them at the time of scheduling. But because dependencies may be satisfied by scheduling prerequisites before them, you can schedule them later. But the maximum concurrency over the schedule may still be limited by the number of tasks ready at any time. But if you can schedule prerequisites earlier, then tasks that were not ready initially can become ready later. So the concurrency can vary.

Hence, concurrency is equal to the maximum number of nodes that can be scheduled at the same time under a topological ordering. This is equal to the maximum size of a "level" in a layering of the DAG. The layering can be computed by topological sorting and computing levels: For each node, compute its level as 1 plus max level of its predecessors? But that gives the longest chain? Wait, if we assign levels such that each node's level > all its predecessors, we can assign all nodes with no predecessors to level 1. Then for each node, assign level as max(levels of predecessors) + 1? Actually, we can assign levels such that if there is an edge u->v, then level(v) > level(u). Then level of each node is at least one more than max level of its predecessors. This yields a topological layering that ensures no precedence violation. Then concurrency is the maximum number of nodes at the same level? But we could also assign multiple nodes to the same level if they are independent. But we might choose levels such that tasks that are independent but have prerequisites from different levels can be scheduled in parallel. The layering that achieves maximum parallelism is known as the "parallel time" of the DAG. It can be found by computing the "critical path" length and then dividing tasks accordingly? Actually, the parallel time can be computed by something like: for each node, assign it the maximum number of levels needed to satisfy all prerequisites. Then concurrency = maximum number of tasks at same level? Let's try with sample DAG. Compute levels: Node1 has no prerequisites -> level1. Node2 has no prerequisites -> level1. Node3 depends on 1 -> level2. Node4 depends on 1 -> level2. Node5 depends on 3 -> level3. Node6 depends on 3 -> level3. Node7 depends on 5,6,4 -> level4? Actually, we need to compute level as max(levels of predecessors) + 1. For node7, predecessors: 5->7,6->7,4->7. Level of 5=3, level of 6=3, level of 4=2. So level7 = max(3,3,2)+1=4. So concurrency = max number of nodes at same level: level1: nodes 1,2 -> 2 tasks. level2: nodes 3,4 -> 2 tasks. level3: nodes 5,6 -> 2 tasks. level4: node 7 -> 1. So concurrency=2.

Thus, concurrency = maximum cardinality of a set of nodes that have same level in the DAG when layering is defined by longest path from sources? Actually, the layering is essentially the "depth" of each node. The maximum number of nodes at the same depth is concurrency.

But we can also compute concurrency as the maximum number of nodes that can be scheduled concurrently at any time. That equals the maximum cardinality of a set of nodes that are pairwise not related by a path, and also each node's prerequisites have been completed before scheduling. But we can schedule the prerequisites earlier. So essentially concurrency = maximum size of an antichain in the DAG after ignoring the nodes that have prerequisites that are not in the antichain? Wait, it's simpler: concurrency is equal to the size of the largest antichain of the DAG that includes only nodes that are all sources at some time after scheduling prerequisites. But maybe this is equivalent to the maximum width of the DAG's topological layers.

Thus, the concurrency number equals the maximum number of nodes that can be "activated" at the same time if you schedule prerequisites as early as possible. That is exactly the maximum number of nodes in any antichain that is also a "downward closed" set? Not exactly.

Better: concurrency = the size of the largest antichain that is a "minimal" set of nodes that can be scheduled concurrently if all prerequisites of each are satisfied. But we can schedule prerequisites earlier.

Thus, concurrency can be computed by topologically sorting and grouping nodes by level where level is defined as the length of the longest path from any source to that node. Then concurrency is maximum number of nodes at any given level. That seems to be correct.

Hence, to compute concurrency, we need to compute for each node the length of the longest path from a source to that node. Then concurrency is the maximum number of nodes with the same longest path length. Because all nodes with same longest path length can be scheduled concurrently after the prerequisites (which are nodes with shorter longest path) have been scheduled. This is essentially the "parallelism" metric.

Thus, solution: compute level = longest distance from a source. That can be computed by dynamic programming after topological sort. Then count nodes per level and take max.

This can be done with O(V+E). For N <= 100, we can handle easily.

We need to ensure correct reading of input. The input format is ambiguous but we can parse accordingly: N, then M, then M pairs.

Thus implement accordingly. Print max count. Test with sample: N=7, edges as above, we compute level: 1->0? Actually, if we start level=0 for sources. Then 1,2 have level=0. Then 3,4 have level=1. Then 5,6 have level=2. Then 7 has level=3. Then concurrency= max number of nodes at same level: 2 at level0, 2 at level1, 2 at level2, 1 at level3 => max=2. Good.

Let's implement. But what about multiple sources? We need to set initial level of source nodes as 0. Then for each node, level[node] = max(level[parent]+1). Use adjacency list. Compute indegree. Then topological order by queue. Then compute levels. Then count. Print max. Done.**Solution Explanation**

For every test a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is given.
The vertices are the tasks, an edge `u → v` means  
*“task `u` must finish before task `v` can start”*.

If we may run several tasks in parallel, at any moment only tasks that
have finished all their predecessors may be executed.
The question asks for the maximum number of tasks that can be executed
simultaneously during the whole process – i.e. the maximum size of a set
of tasks that can be scheduled at the same time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1.  Observations

* All tasks that have no predecessors are “ready” at the very beginning.
  They can all be started together – they are independent.

* For a task `v` all its predecessors lie in earlier stages.
  The length of the longest path that ends in `v`
  tells how many stages must finish before `v` may be started.

* If two tasks have the same longest‑path length,
  all their predecessors are in strictly earlier stages.
  Consequently, after finishing those earlier tasks,
  both of them become ready **at the same time** and can run in parallel.

* Tasks with different longest‑path lengths can never be started together,
  because at least one of them would still have an unfinished predecessor.

Hence:

```
Longest path length (starting with 0 for sources) of a task = its level.
All tasks with equal level become ready after the earlier levels
and can be executed together.
```

The answer is therefore the largest number of vertices that share the
same level.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2.  Algorithm

The DAG contains at most `N = 100` vertices,
therefore an `O(V + E)` algorithm is more than fast enough.

```
read graph
compute indegree of every vertex
queue ← all vertices with indegree 0
level[v] ← 0 for all vertices

while queue not empty
        u ← pop front
        for each child v of u
                level[v] ← max(level[v], level[u] + 1)
                decrease indegree[v]
                if indegree[v] becomes 0
                        push v to queue

answer ← maximum count of vertices having the same level
output answer
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2.  Correctness Proof  

We prove that the algorithm outputs the maximum number of tasks that can
be executed in parallel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Lemma 1  
For every vertex `v`, after the algorithm terminates  
`level[v]` equals the length of the longest directed path from any source
to `v` (number of edges on that path).

**Proof.**

The algorithm processes vertices in a topological order:
a vertex is popped from the queue only after all its predecessors
have already been popped.  
When a vertex `u` is processed, for each child `v` the algorithm sets

```
level[v] = max(level[v], level[u] + 1)
```

Initially all sources have level `0`.  
Inductively, when a vertex `v` is processed, all its predecessors have
already been processed, therefore `max(level[parent])` equals the longest
path ending in any predecessor of `v`.  
Adding one for the edge to `v` gives exactly the longest path length to
`v`.  ∎



--------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Lemma 2  
All tasks with the same level can be scheduled to run simultaneously.

**Proof.**

Let all tasks of level `L` be `S = {t1, …, tk}`.  
By Lemma&nbsp;1 each of them has all its predecessors in levels `< L`.  
Therefore after finishing all tasks in levels `< L`
every task in `S` has all its predecessors finished.
Hence all tasks in `S` can start at the same moment.  ∎



--------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Lemma 3  
No set of tasks of different levels can run simultaneously.

**Proof.**

Take two tasks `u` and `v` with different levels.
Assume `level[u] < level[v]`.  
From Lemma&nbsp;1, at least one predecessor of `v`
lies in a level `< level[v]` – in particular in a level `≤ level[u]`.  
Consequently `v` cannot start before `u` (or its predecessor) finishes,
hence `u` and `v` cannot be executed at the same time.  ∎



--------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Theorem  
The algorithm outputs the maximum possible number of tasks that can be
executed in parallel.

**Proof.**

*Upper bound:*  
By Lemma&nbsp;3, any set of concurrently running tasks must all have
identical levels.  
Therefore the size of such a set is at most the number of vertices in
the most populated level, which the algorithm computes as `answer`.

*Achievability:*  
For the level `L` that maximizes the number of vertices,
Lemma&nbsp;2 shows that all those vertices can be executed together.
Thus the algorithm’s `answer` is attainable.

Hence `answer` is both an upper bound and achievable, i.e. it equals the
maximum parallelism. ∎



--------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.  Complexity Analysis

Let `V` be the number of tasks (`N ≤ 100`) and `E` the number of edges.

* Building the graph: `O(E)`
* Topological sorting and level computation: each vertex and edge processed once → `O(V + E)`
* Counting levels: `O(V)`

Memory usage: adjacency lists store `E` edges and several `O(V)` arrays,
well within the limits.
