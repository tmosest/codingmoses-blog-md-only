        ## 1.  The Problem – Incremental Memory Leak (LeetCode 1860)

You are given two memory sticks that start with  

* `memory1` bits on the first stick  
* `memory2` bits on the second stick  

A faulty program is running and **allocates an increasing amount of memory every second**:

| second `i` | how many bits are allocated | to which stick |
|------------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| 1          | 1                           | stick with more free space (first stick if tie) |
| 2          | 2                           | the same rule |
| 3          | 3                           | … |
| …          | …                           | … |

If at any second neither stick has at least `i` free bits, the program crashes.  
Return an array `[crashTime, memory1AfterCrash, memory2AfterCrash]`.

Example  
`memory1 = 8, memory2 = 11 → [6, 0, 4]`

---

## 2.  Brute‑Force / Simulation Solution (O(√n))

The amount of memory taken in `t` seconds is  
`1 + 2 + … + t = t(t+1)/2`.  
Because each second the program takes at least `i` bits, the time until a crash is bounded by `O(√(memory1+memory2))`.  
Thus a simple simulation loop is fast enough for the given limits (`≤ 2^31‑1`).

### 2.1 Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] memLeak(int memory1, int memory2) {
        int i = 1;                         // current second
        while (Math.max(memory1, memory2) >= i) {
            if (memory1 >= memory2)        // stick with more free space
                memory1 -= i;
            else
                memory2 -= i;
            i++;
        }
        return new int[]{i, memory1, memory2};
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def memLeak(self, memory1: int, memory2: int) -> List[int]:
        i = 1
        while max(memory1, memory2) >= i:
            if memory1 >= memory2:
                memory1 -= i
            else:
                memory2 -= i
            i += 1
        return [i, memory1, memory2]
```

### 2.3 C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> memLeak(int memory1, int memory2) {
        int i = 1;
        while (max(memory1, memory2) >= i) {
            if (memory1 >= memory2)
                memory1 -= i;
            else
                memory2 -= i;
            ++i;
        }
        return {i, memory1, memory2};
    }
};
```

---

## 3.  Optimized Binary‑Search Approach (O(log n))

Instead of simulating every second, we can binary‑search the crash time `t`.  
For a given `t`, the total memory used by the program is `t(t+1)/2`.  
We need the largest `t` such that **both sticks together can cover** that amount **and** each stick can absorb the allocations following the rule (allocate to the stick with more free memory).  
The binary search runs in `O(log t)` ≈ `O(log (√(memory1+memory2)))`, which is trivial for 32‑bit inputs.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] memLeak(int memory1, int memory2) {
        int low = 1, high = 1;
        // Expand high until we know the crash will happen before it
        while (Math.max(memory1, memory2) >= high) high *= 2;
        int crashTime = low;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            long used = (long)mid * (mid + 1) / 2;          // total memory used until mid
            if (used <= memory1 + memory2) {                // enough combined memory
                // Simulate just the allocation order for `mid` seconds
                int a = memory1, b = memory2;
                for (int i = 1; i <= mid; i++) {
                    if (a >= b) a -= i;
                    else        b -= i;
                }
                if (a < 0 || b < 0) {                      // crash occurs before mid
                    high = mid - 1;
                } else {                                   // safe up to mid
                    crashTime = mid + 1;
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        // After binary search, we still need the exact final memory state
        int crash = crashTime;
        int a = memory1, b = memory2;
        for (int i = 1; i < crash; i++) {
            if (a >= b) a -= i;
            else        b -= i;
        }
        return new int[]{crash, a, b};
    }
}
```

*(The Python & C++ versions follow the same logic.)*

> **Why is this “nice”?**  
> The binary search reduces the number of simulated seconds dramatically, especially for huge inputs (e.g. `memory1 = memory2 = 2^31-1`). The simulation part inside the loop runs only up to `mid` (≤ ~46,000) – trivial compared to the naive approach.

### The Problem in Plain English

Two memory sticks, `memory1` and `memory2`.  
A program runs, and each second it consumes an increasing amount of memory:

- 1 bit at second 1  
- 2 bits at second 2  
- 3 bits at second 3, …

At each second it allocates to the stick with **more free memory** (first stick if tie).  
If neither stick can supply the required `i` bits, the program crashes.  
Return `[crashTime, remainingMemory1, remainingMemory2]`.

---

### Good – A Clear, Simplicial Solution

The naïve simulation is easy to write, easy to understand, and fast enough for the constraints.

*Why it’s good*

- **Readability** – One loop, one `if` clause.  
- **Correctness** – Directly follows the problem statement.  
- **Complexity** – `O(√(memory1+memory2))`, which is < 50 000 iterations even for the maximum input.  

**Java Implementation (cleaned up for readability)**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] memLeak(int memory1, int memory2) {
        int sec = 1;
        while (Math.max(memory1, memory2) >= sec) {
            if (memory1 >= memory2) memory1 -= sec;
            else                      memory2 -= sec;
            sec++;
        }
        return new int[]{sec, memory1, memory2};
    }
}
```

*The same logic applies to Python and C++ – see the code blocks above.*

---

### Bad – What You Should Avoid

| Bad Practice | Why It’s Bad |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Ignoring the “stick with more free memory” rule** | Leads to wrong crash times. |
| **Using 32‑bit arithmetic for `i(i+1)/2`** | Overflow when `i` ≈ 65 000. |
| **Re‑allocating arrays every loop** | Tiny overhead, but makes the code harder to read. |
| **Premature optimization (binary search)** | Overkill for a medium‑level interview – you risk making the solution harder to explain. |

**Common Mistake Example (Python)**

```python
while memory1 + memory2 >= i:  # WRONG
```

This checks combined memory, not the rule that the *larger* stick must have at least `i` bits.

---

### Ugly – Edge Cases That Can Trip You Up

1. **Zero Memory on One Stick**  
   `memory1 = 0, memory2 = 0` → crash immediately at second 1.  
   Ensure your loop starts at `i = 1`.

2. **Equal Memory, Large Input**  
   The rule *“stick with more free memory (first if tie)”* must be respected.  
   Forgetting the tie‑break can produce `[4, ...]` instead of `[3, ...]`.

3. **Overflow When Calculating `i(i+1)/2`**  
   In a binary‑search solution, use `long` or `int64_t` to hold the product.

4. **Very Large Input (≥ 2^30)**  
   While the simulation runs in < 50 000 steps, the binary‑search version must expand `high` cautiously to avoid infinite loops.

---

### The Binary‑Search “Nice” Trick

If you want to show that you can think beyond brute‑force, a binary‑search approach is elegant.

*Why it’s nice for the “ugly” large‑input test case*

- **Fewer loop iterations** – O(log n) instead of O(√n).  
- **Predictable runtime** – Works uniformly for all inputs.  
- **Demonstrates algorithmic thinking** – Shows you understand that the total memory used follows a quadratic pattern.

**Key Insight**

The crash time is the first second `t` where the program **cannot** allocate to the *larger* stick.  
We binary‑search for that `t` while still using a tiny simulation for the “allocation order” part.

---

### How to Explain This in an Interview

1. **State the greedy rule** – “Allocate to the stick with more free memory; first stick if tie.”  
2. **Show the upper bound** – “The program can’t run beyond `t` where `t(t+1)/2 > memory1 + memory2` → `t = O(√n)`.”  
3. **Present the simple loop** – “We’ll just run that loop; it’s clear, correct, and fast.”  
4. **Optionally mention binary‑search** – “If you want to impress the interviewer with a log‑time trick, we can binary‑search the crash time; but we’ll keep the explanation short.”

---

### Take‑Away Summary

| Approach | When to Use | Language |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Simulation** | Most interview contexts | Java / Python / C++ |
| **Binary‑Search** | When asked for “optimal algorithm” or huge inputs | Java / Python / C++ |

*Remember*: In an interview, clarity beats cleverness unless the interviewer explicitly asks for optimization.
