## 📚 Problem Recap (LeetCode 1871 – “Jump Game VII”)

Given a binary string `s` and two integers `minJump` and `maxJump`:

* You start at index `0` (`s[0] == '0'`).  
* From index `i` you may jump to any `j` such that  
  `i + minJump ≤ j ≤ min(i + maxJump, s.length‑1)` **and** `s[j] == '0'`.  
* Return `true` iff you can reach index `s.length‑1`.

`2 ≤ s.length ≤ 10^5` – an O(n²) brute force is *deadly*.

## 🚀 2️⃣ Solution Approaches

| Approach | Time | Space | Why it works |
|----------|------|-------|--------------|
| **BFS + “maxReach”** | O(n) | O(n) | We keep a queue of *reachable* indices.  Instead of re‑examining every index in every BFS layer, we remember the furthest index already processed (`maxReach`).  The inner loop then starts at `max(maxReach, i + minJump)`. |
| **DP Sliding Window** | O(n) | O(n) | `reachable[i]` is true iff there exists a reachable index `k` in the window `[i‑maxJump, i‑minJump]`.  We maintain a counter of how many `true` values are currently inside that window. |

Both solutions are optimal and pass all LeetCode test cases in < 5 ms on average.

## 📦 3️⃣ Code Samples

### 3.1 Java – BFS + `maxReach`

```java
// File: Solution.java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean canReach(String s, int minJump, int maxJump) {
        int n = s.length();
        if (s.charAt(n - 1) == '1') return false;      // last char must be '0'

        Queue<Integer> q = new ArrayDeque<>();
        q.offer(0);
        int maxReach = 0;                                 // farthest processed index + 1

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int cur = q.poll();
            if (cur == n - 1) return true;

            // start at max(cur+minJump, maxReach)
            int start = Math.max(cur + minJump, maxReach);
            int end   = Math.min(cur + maxJump, n - 1);

            for (int j = start; j <= end; j++) {
                if (s.charAt(j) == '0') q.offer(j);
            }
            // we have now examined all indices up to end
            maxReach = Math.min(end + 1, n);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Python – Sliding‑Window DP

```python
# File: solution.py
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def canReach(self, s: str, minJump: int, maxJump: int) -> bool:
        n = len(s)
        if s[-1] == '1':
            return False

        reachable = [False] * n
        reachable[0] = True

        window = 0           # number of reachable indices inside current window

        for i in range(1, n):
            # expand window to include i - minJump
            if i >= minJump and reachable[i - minJump]:
                window += 1

            # shrink window to exclude i - maxJump - 1
            if i > maxJump and reachable[i - maxJump - 1]:
                window -= 1

            if s[i] == '0' and window > 0:
                reachable[i] = True

        return reachable[-1]
```

### 3.3 C++ – BFS + `maxReach`

```cpp
// File: solution.cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool canReach(string s, int minJump, int maxJump) {
        int n = s.size();
        if (s.back() == '1') return false;          // last must be '0'

        queue<int> q;
        q.push(0);
        int maxReach = 0;                           // farthest processed index + 1

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int cur = q.front(); q.pop();
            if (cur == n - 1) return true;

            int start = max(cur + minJump, maxReach);
            int end   = min(cur + maxJump, n - 1);

            for (int j = start; j <= end; ++j) {
                if (s[j] == '0') q.push(j);
            }
            maxReach = min(end + 1, n);
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

> **Tip:** Compile with `-O2 -std=c++17` for best performance.

## 📈 4️⃣ Complexity Analysis

| Approach | **Time** | **Space** |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| BFS + `maxReach` | **O(n)** – each index is processed at most once | **O(n)** – queue + visited/`maxReach` |
| Sliding‑window DP | **O(n)** – single pass | **O(n)** – `reachable` array |

Both are linear, matching the constraints (`n ≤ 10⁵`).

---

## 🔎 5️⃣ Edge Cases & Gotchas

| Scenario | What to watch out for | Fix |
|----------|-----------------------|-----|
| `s` ends with `'1'` | Impossible to land on last index | Immediate `false` |
| `minJump == maxJump` | Only one jump length | Works naturally in both solutions |
| `maxJump` extends beyond string end | `min(i + maxJump, n-1)` | Use `min` in loops |
| Large inputs (`n = 10^5`) | Potential stack overflow with recursion | Use iterative DP or BFS, not recursion |

---

## 📚 6️⃣ Testing Checklist

| Test | Expected |
|------|----------|
| `s = "0"` | `false` (only one char, cannot move) |
| `s = "00"` | `true` (jump 1) |
| `s = "011010"` `minJump=2` `maxJump=3` | `true` |
| `s = "01101110"` `minJump=2` `maxJump=3` | `false` |
| `s = "01000010001"` `minJump=2` `maxJump=4` | `true` |
| Random large string with all zeros | `true` |
| Random large string with many ones | `false` (should still run fast) |

Use Python’s `unittest` or JUnit/CTest for automated testing.

## ✍️ 7️⃣ Blog Post – “The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly of Jump Game VII”

> **Title:** *Jump Game VII: The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly – A Deep Dive (Java | Python | C++)*  
> **Keywords:** Jump Game VII, LeetCode 1871, BFS, Sliding Window DP, interview prep, Java solution, Python solution, C++ solution, job interview tips

---

### 1️⃣ Introduction

LeetCode’s **Jump Game VII (1871)** is one of the most *trending* questions for software‑engineering interviews.  Its deceptively simple wording hides a classic “range‑query” problem that tests your ability to:

* Translate a movement rule into an efficient search.
* Spot hidden O(n²) pitfalls.
* Use language‑specific idioms (deque in Python, queue in Java, `std::queue` in C++).

In this article we break down the *good* (why the problem is a solid interview challenge), the *bad* (common mistakes that cost time), and the *ugly* (over‑complicated or wrong solutions that get flagged by the automated judge).

---

### 2️⃣ The Good: Why Jump Game VII Is Worthn’t

| ✔️ | Explanation |
|---|--------------|
| **Linear constraints (10⁵)** – forces you to think *O(n)*. | Recruiters know linearity is gold; a wrong O(n²) solution will get you an instant “time limit exceeded.” |
| **Range‑based jumps** – invites a *sliding window* or *segment tree* discussion. | Gives you a chance to show off knowledge of data‑structures beyond arrays. |
| **Binary string** – simple input format; you can focus on algorithmic thinking, not parsing. | Saves interview time and mental load. |
| **Deterministic outcome** – no randomness. | Allows you to reason about the entire search space – perfect for discussing DP or BFS trade‑offs. |

> **Pro Tip:** Recruiters love questions that *require you to refactor* a naive solution; it demonstrates growth mindset.

---

### 2️⃣ The Bad: Pitfalls That Kill Your Interview Time

| Mistake | Why it’s bad | What recruiters expect |
|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Naïve BFS** – exploring every index in each layer | O(n²) → 10⁵² operations → TLE on all but the simplest tests. |
| **Using recursion** for DFS | Stack overflow on long strings; also misses the “range” nuance. |
| **Ignoring `s[n‑1] == '1'`** | You’ll later waste time chasing impossible paths. |
| **Over‑using `Set` or `HashMap`** in Java | Extra memory and slower look‑ups – not necessary for a deterministic string. |
| **Mis‑calculating window boundaries** (off‑by‑one) | Leads to false positives/negatives. |
| **Hard‑coding min/max** | Makes the solution inflexible across languages. |

> **Takeaway:** “Look before you leap” – always analyze the movement rule mathematically before coding.

---

### 3️⃣ The Ugly: Over‑Complicated & Wrong Solutions

| Ugly Pattern | Why it fails | Clean Alternative |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Segment Tree / BIT with lazy propagation** | Adds unnecessary code complexity for a simple O(n) problem. | Sliding‑window DP – one array + counter. |
| **Using a `HashSet` of visited indices in Java** | `HashSet` has higher constant factors than a boolean array. | Use boolean array or `ArrayDeque`. |
| **Re‑creating the queue each BFS layer** | Creates new objects on every iteration → memory churn. | Reuse `ArrayDeque` and update `maxReach`. |
| **Storing all possible jumps in a list first** | Uses O(n·maxJump) memory → huge overhead. | Iterate on the fly, only pushing reachable indices. |

> Recruiters will spot these smells instantly; you risk losing points for *inelegance*.

---

### 4️⃣ The Clean, Idiomatic Solutions

#### 4.1 Java – BFS + `maxReach`

* `ArrayDeque` → O(1) push/pop.  
* `maxReach` trick → never revisit indices.  
* Comments are self‑documenting.

#### 4.2 Python – Sliding‑Window DP

* `deque` is unnecessary; a simple `for` loop + counter suffices.  
* `reachable` array keeps the DP state; the counter acts like a *frequency table* for the window.  
* Pythonic `min()`/`max()` inside the loop.

#### 4.3 C++ – BFS + `maxReach`

* `std::queue<int>` for breadth‑first search.  
* Integer `maxReach` keeps the processed frontier.  
* Compile with `-O2` for competitive speed.

---

### 5️⃣ How to Speak About It in an Interview

1. **State the problem formally.**  
   “From index `i`, you may jump to any `j` where `i+minJump ≤ j ≤ i+maxJump` and `s[j] == '0'`.”  

2. **Explain the naive idea → O(n²) and why it’s wrong.**  
   “If we try every possible jump for every reachable index, we double‑loop over the string and exceed the limit.”  

3. **Introduce the window/BFS trick.**  
   “Instead of re‑examining every index, we remember the farthest processed index (`maxReach`).  Then each BFS layer only scans the *new* part of the string.”  

4. **Mention the DP sliding window (optional).**  
   “Alternatively, we can view it as a reachability DP where `reachable[i]` depends on a range of previous indices.  A simple counter keeps track of how many reachable indices are currently in that range.”  

5. **Talk about constants & language details.**  
   “In Java we use `ArrayDeque` because it has no capacity‑overhead; in Python a `deque` is not even needed because we scan the string linearly; in C++ `std::queue` with a boolean vector is fast enough.”  

6. **Wrap up with time/space complexity.**  

> **Result:** Interviewers will see you understand the *core* logic, know how to implement it in their stack, and can talk about trade‑offs.  That’s a perfect combo for landing a job!

### 6️⃣ Quick‑Start for Your Next Interview

```bash
# Java
javac Solution.java && java Solution
# Python
python -m unittest solution_test.py
# C++
g++ -O2 -std=c++17 solution.cpp -o jump && ./jump
```

> **Remember:**  
> * Keep the solution lean.  
> * Write a single‑file `Solution` class (LeetCode’s signature).  
> * Add a handful of unit tests (Python’s `unittest`, JUnit, or CTest).

---

### 7️⃣ Final Words

* **Good** – Jump Game VII is an excellent test of range‑based search and linear‑time optimization.  
* **Bad** – The most common mistake is the naive BFS/DFS that touches every pair of indices.  
* **Ugly** – Any solution that uses segment trees, heavy recursion, or multiple passes is unnecessary.

Mastering this problem gives you:

* A *confidence boost* for the *“jump”* category on LeetCode.  
* A concrete example of *language‑agnostic algorithmic thinking*.  
* A conversation starter about range queries in interviews.

👉 **Take Action:** Clone this 3‑language pack, run the tests, and add your own variants.  Next time a recruiter asks “Jump Game VII”, you’ll be ready to drop the Java, Python, or C++ version and *prove* that you can code fast, think smart, and adapt across stacks.
