## 1. Problem Overview

> **Minimum Skips to Arrive at Meeting On Time**  
> **Difficulty:** Hard  

You have `n` roads with lengths `dist[i]` (km).  
You travel at a constant speed `speed` (km/h).  
After finishing road `i`, you *must* wait until the next integer hour **unless** you choose to **skip** the rest.  
Skipping allows you to immediately start the next road.  
Your goal: **arrive at the meeting in at most `hoursBefore` hours**.  
Return the *minimum* number of skips needed, or `-1` if impossible.

> **Constraints**  
> - 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000  
> - 1 ≤ dist[i] ≤ 10⁵  
> - 1 ≤ speed ≤ 10⁶  
> - 1 ≤ hoursBefore ≤ 10⁷

## 2. Why This Problem Rocks for Interviews

| Interview Skill | How the Problem Helps |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| **Dynamic Programming** | 1‑D DP with state “skips used” and transition “skip or not”. |
| **Greedy & Math Insight** | Ceiling operation → integer arithmetic without `double`. |
| **Time Complexity Management** | O(n²) or O(n²) with optimization to 1‑D DP. |
| **Precision Handling** | Avoid floating point errors. |
| **Edge‑Case Thinking** | Skipping all roads, last road special case. |

Candidates who nail this problem demonstrate strong DP intuition and careful handling of precision—highly prized in coding interviews.

## 3. Key Observations & Edge Cases

1. **Skipping is always non‑harmful** – if you skip a rest, you can never arrive later than if you didn't.
2. **The time spent on a road can be expressed as an integer multiple of speed**:  
   `ceil(dist[i] / speed)` → `ceil( dist[i] )` in units of *seconds* if you multiply everything by `speed`.
3. **Last road never needs a rest** – the waiting rule only applies *between* roads.
4. **Integer arithmetic only** – multiply all times by `speed` to keep them integers and avoid floating‑point errors.
5. **DP state** – `dp[j]` = *minimum total time (in units of *speed*)* to finish the processed roads using exactly `j` skips.

## 4. The Classic DP Solution (Integer‑Only)

We use a *bottom‑up 1‑D DP* that iterates over roads and updates the array from high to low skip counts.

```
Let T = hoursBefore * speed   // Convert deadline to the same unit as dp values

for each road i:
    for j from maxSkips down to 0:
        // 1. Without skipping: add waiting time (ceiling)
        notSkip = ceil(dp[j] + dist[i])          // same as (dp[j] + dist[i] + speed-1) / speed * speed
        // 2. With skipping: only allowed if j>0
        skip    = (j > 0) ? dp[j-1] + dist[i] : INF
        if i == lastRoad:
            dp[j] = dp[j] + dist[i]            // No wait after last road
        else:
            dp[j] = min(skip, notSkip)
```

After filling `dp`, the answer is the smallest `j` such that `dp[j] <= T`.

All operations stay in 64‑bit integers (`long` in Java/C++/Python `int`).

## 5. Java Implementation – Bottom‑Up 1‑D DP

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minSkips(int[] dist, int speed, int hoursBefore) {
        int n = dist.length;
        long T = (long) hoursBefore * speed;          // Deadline in “speed units”
        long INF = Long.MAX_VALUE / 4;                // safe infinity

        long[] dp = new long[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, 0);                           // dp[0] = 0 before starting

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int d = dist[i];
            for (int j = Math.min(i, n); j >= 0; j--) {
                // Wait time if we don't skip
                long notSkip = ceil(dp[j] + d, speed);

                // Skip rest
                long skip = (j > 0) ? dp[j - 1] + d : INF;

                if (i == n - 1) {          // Last road
                    dp[j] = dp[j] + d;     // no waiting after the final segment
                } else {
                    dp[j] = Math.min(skip, notSkip);
                }
            }
        }

        for (int skips = 0; skips <= n; skips++) {
            if (dp[skips] <= T) return skips;
        }
        return -1;
    }

    // Integer ceiling of (value / speed) * speed
    private long ceil(long value, int speed) {
        return (value + speed - 1) / speed * speed;
    }
}
```

**Why this version wins the “good” rating?**  
*No `double`, no precision loss, single array updates, and clear variable names.*

## 6. Python Implementation – 1‑D DP with Ceiling Trick

Python’s `int` is arbitrary‑precision, so we can keep everything in 64‑bit range without overflow. The ceiling trick is identical to Java.

```python
class Solution:
    def minSkips(self, dist: list[int], speed: int, hoursBefore: int) -> int:
        n = len(dist)
        T = hoursBefore * speed                # Deadline in the same unit as dp values
        INF = 10**18

        dp = [0] + [INF] * n                   # dp[j] = min time using j skips

        for i, d in enumerate(dist):
            # iterate from high to low skips
            for j in range(min(i, n), -1, -1):
                # wait time without skipping
                not_skip = (dp[j] + d + speed - 1) // speed * speed
                skip = dp[j - 1] + d if j > 0 else INF

                if i == n - 1:                 # last road – no wait
                    dp[j] = dp[j] + d
                else:
                    dp[j] = min(skip, not_skip)

        for skips, time in enumerate(dp):
            if time <= T:
                return skips
        return -1
```

*Why Python?*  
- Same integer math; no `float`.  
- Clean and concise; just two nested loops.

## 6. C++ Implementation – Fast & Precise

Below is a `constexpr`‑friendly C++17 solution that can be compiled with `-O2`.  

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minSkips(vector<int>& dist, int speed, int hoursBefore) {
        const int n = dist.size();
        const long long T = 1LL * hoursBefore * speed;   // Deadline in “speed units”
        const long long INF = (1LL << 60);

        vector<long long> dp(n + 1, 0);   // dp[j] – min time with j skips

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int d = dist[i];
            for (int j = min(i, n); j >= 0; --j) {
                long long notSkip = (dp[j] + d + speed - 1) / speed * speed;
                long long skip = (j > 0) ? dp[j - 1] + d : INF;
                if (i == n - 1) {
                    dp[j] += d;  // no wait after last road
                } else {
                    dp[j] = min(skip, notSkip);
                }
            }
        }

        for (int skips = 0; skips <= n; ++skips) {
            if (dp[skips] <= T) return skips;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

> **Tip:** Use `long long` to avoid overflow (`dist[i] * n` can be up to 10⁸, which fits easily in 64‑bit).

## 6. Time & Space Complexity

| Implementation | Time | Space |
|----------------|------|-------|
| Java / Python / C++ DP | **O(n²)** (≈ 1 million iterations for n = 1000) | **O(n)** (1‑D array of size `n+1`) |
| Alternative 2‑D DP | **O(n²)** | **O(n²)** (usually too big for n = 1000 in Python, but still acceptable in LeetCode due to small constant factor) |

Both languages above are *fast enough* for the LeetCode “hard” tests.  
If you need an O(n) solution, the problem is actually *NP‑hard* (it is a form of scheduling with integer constraints).  
So the quadratic DP is the optimal general solution.

## 7. Common Pitfalls (The Ugly)

| Mistake | Consequence | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Using `double` and `ceil()`** | Floating‑point precision loss (e.g., `30.00001 <= 30` → false). | Work in *integers only*; multiply by `speed` before ceil. |
| **Not handling the last road** | Adds unnecessary waiting after the final segment, over‑counting time. | Special‑case the last iteration or remove the wait in the loop. |
| **Updating DP forward (low → high)** | Wrong states are used because earlier updates overwrite values needed for higher skip counts. | Update `dp` from high to low skip indices. |
| **Using `int` instead of `long`** | Overflow when `hoursBefore * speed` > 2³¹. | Use `long` (Java), `long long` (C++), or Python’s unlimited `int`. |
| **Assuming `skips ≤ n-1`** | Failing when you need to skip all roads; the DP array must support up to `n` skips. | Initialize DP size `n+1` and loop `j` from `min(i, n)` down to `0`. |

## 8. How to Polish Your Solution for a Job Interview

1. **Explain the DP state clearly** – “dp[j] = minimum time after finishing the processed roads using exactly j skips.”  
2. **Show the waiting rule in code** – emphasise that the last road skips the wait.  
3. **Mention integer math** – “We convert all times to units of `speed` to avoid floating‑point errors.”  
4. **Walk through a small example** (e.g., `dist=[1,2,3]`, `speed=1`, `hoursBefore=2.5`) on the whiteboard.  
5. **Ask the interviewer** whether they’d prefer O(n²) or O(n·log n) – adapt accordingly.  
6. **Prepare for follow‑up questions**:  
   - What if `speed` is very large?  
   - How does the solution behave if we skip all roads?  
   - Can we prove that skipping never hurts?  

> *Pro tip:* Keep the code tidy, use helper functions for `ceil`, and comment each loop iteration. Clear code = higher rating in interviews.

<a name="faq"></a>
## 9. FAQ

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Can we solve this in O(n) time?** | No. The problem is essentially a constrained scheduling problem that is NP‑hard. Quadratic DP is optimal for n ≤ 1000. |
| **Why not use `double` and `ceil()` directly?** | It works but introduces subtle bugs due to floating‑point rounding. Integer math guarantees correctness. |
| **What if `hoursBefore` is non‑integral?** | The input guarantees an integer, but if it were a float you’d still convert the deadline to “speed units” by multiplying by `speed` and use `ceil` on the road times. |
| **Is there a greedy solution?** | No. Greedy would fail for cases where skipping a later road yields a better overall schedule. DP is required. |
