        ## 1. Solution Overview (LeetCode 1888)

**Problem** –  
Given a binary string `s`, you may

1. **Rotate** – move the first character to the end (`type‑1` operation).
2. **Flip** – change any character `0↔1` (`type‑2` operation).

Find the *minimum* number of flips needed after an optimal sequence of rotations so that the string becomes **alternating** (no two adjacent characters are equal).

> *Key insight* –  
> Rotating a string by one position is equivalent to changing the *parity* of the target pattern you compare against.  
> We can therefore look at **every rotation** of `s` and count how many characters differ from the two possible alternating patterns `"0101…"` and `"1010…"`.  
> The answer is the minimum of those mismatch counts over all rotations.

The classic sliding‑window trick lets us evaluate all rotations in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** extra space.

## 2. Algorithm

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Let `n = s.length()`. |
| 2 | Treat the string as if it were *doubled* (`s + s`). Any window of length `n` in this doubled string corresponds to one rotation of the original string. |
| 3 | For each index `i` from `0` to `2n-1` keep a running mismatch count `mis` for the pattern that starts with `'1'` at the *current* window start (`i`). The pattern that starts with `'0'` is simply `n - mis`. |
| 4 | When `i ≥ n`, remove the character that is now leaving the window from `mis`. |
| 5 | When we have processed at least `n` characters (`i ≥ n-1`), update the global minimum with `min(minFlips, min(mis, n - mis))`. |
| 6 | Return the global minimum. |

The algorithm is essentially the sliding‑window solution shown in the reference LeetCode post, but rewritten with clearer variable names and comments.

## 3. Complexities

| Metric | Java | Python | C++ |
|--------|------|--------|-----|
| Time   | **O(n)** | **O(n)** | **O(n)** |
| Space  | **O(1)** (besides input) | **O(1)** | **O(1)** |

`n` is the length of the input string (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵`).

### 4.1 Java

```java
/**

 *
 * This implementation uses a sliding window over a virtual doubled string
 * to evaluate every rotation in O(n) time and O(1) space.
 */
class Solution {
    public int minFlips(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int minFlips = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // answer candidate

        int mis = 0;          // mismatches for pattern starting with '1'
        // Walk over the doubled string implicitly
        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
            int idx = i % n;  // real index in original string

            // Expected bit for pattern '1 0 1 0 ...' at position i
            int expected = (i % 2 == 0) ? 1 : 0;
            int actual   = s.charAt(idx) - '0';

            if (actual != expected) mis++;   // add mismatch for current window

            // Remove element that is no longer in the window
            if (i >= n) {
                int leaveIdx = idx;
                int leaveExpected = (i % 2 == 0) ? 1 : 0;
                int leaveActual = s.charAt(leaveIdx) - '0';
                if (leaveActual != leaveExpected) mis--;
            }

            // Once we have a full window (size n), update answer
            if (i >= n - 1) {
                int flipsForPattern1 = mis;          // pattern starts with '1'
                int flipsForPattern0 = n - mis;      // pattern starts with '0'
                minFlips = Math.min(minFlips,
                                    Math.min(flipsForPattern1, flipsForPattern0));
            }
        }
        return minFlips;
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minFlips(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        min_flips = n + 1          # upper bound
        mis = 0                    # mismatches for pattern starting with '1'

        for i in range(2 * n):
            idx = i % n
            expected = 1 if i % 2 == 0 else 0
            actual = int(s[idx])

            if actual != expected:
                mis += 1

            if i >= n:  # element leaving the window
                leave_idx = idx
                leave_expected = 1 if i % 2 == 0 else 0
                leave_actual = int(s[leave_idx])
                if leave_actual != leave_expected:
                    mis -= 1

            if i >= n - 1:
                flips_start_with_1 = mis
                flips_start_with_0 = n - mis
                min_flips = min(min_flips,
                                min(flips_start_with_1, flips_start_with_0))

        return min_flips
```

### 4.3 C++

```cpp
/**
 * LeetCode 1888 – Minimum Number of Flips to Make the Binary String Alternating
 * Sliding window over a virtual doubled string.
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int minFlips(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int minFlips = n + 1;   // upper bound
        int mis = 0;            // mismatches for pattern starting with '1'

        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; ++i) {
            int idx = i % n;
            int expected = (i % 2 == 0) ? 1 : 0;
            int actual   = s[idx] - '0';

            if (actual != expected) ++mis;          // add mismatch

            if (i >= n) {                           // remove leaving char
                int leaveIdx = idx;
                int leaveExpected = (i % 2 == 0) ? 1 : 0;
                int leaveActual = s[leaveIdx] - '0';
                if (leaveActual != leaveExpected) --mis;
            }

            if (i >= n - 1) {                       // full window ready
                int flipsStart1 = mis;
                int flipsStart0 = n - mis;
                minFlips = std::min(minFlips,
                                    std::min(flipsStart1, flipsStart0));
            }
        }
        return minFlips;
    }
};
```

All three codes run in **O(n)** time and use **O(1)** extra memory, satisfying the constraints even for `n = 10⁵`.

---

### 5.2 Intro

> In the world of technical interviews, the *binary string* is a recurring motif. LeetCode 1888, “Minimum Number of Flips to Make the Binary String Alternating,” is a perfect example of a problem that blends **string manipulation**, **bit logic**, and **algorithmic ingenuity**.  
> This article breaks the problem into three layers – the *good* (the problem’s intuition), the *bad* (common pitfalls), and the *ugly* (edge cases that trip up many coders). We’ll finish with clean, production‑ready solutions in Java, Python, and C++, and finish with a few interview‑style follow‑ups.

---

### 5.3 The Good – Why This Problem Is Great

1. **Clear Goal, Non‑trivial Constraints**  
   *You want an alternating string, but you can rotate any number of times.*  
   The challenge is to figure out *how* rotation interacts with flipping.

2. **Leverages a Classic Technique**  
   The sliding‑window over a *doubled string* is a canonical pattern used in problems like “Longest Repeating Character Replacement” and “Circular Array Rotation.”  
   Seeing this pattern again reinforces your mastery of the concept.

3. **Scales**  
   The constraints (`n ≤ 10⁵`) force you to think of an **O(n)** solution.  
   Brute force (O(n²)) will clearly fail, making this a perfect test of algorithmic efficiency.

4. **Interview Relevance**  
   Interviewers love this problem because it tests:
   - **String manipulation**  
   - **Parity / bitwise reasoning**  
   - **Sliding window / two‑pointer technique**  
   - **Space/Time trade‑offs**

---

### 5.4 The Bad – Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Treating rotation as a simple “shift”** | Some solutions mistakenly modify the string for every rotation, leading to O(n²) time. | Treat the string as *doubled* and use a sliding window of length `n`. |
| **Confusing the two alternating patterns** | The alternating string could start with `0` or `1`. Forgetting the second pattern doubles the error. | Compute mismatches for both patterns (`0101…` and `1010…`) and take the min. |
| **Off‑by‑one errors in window indices** | Off‑by‑one mistakes are common when the window starts at `i ≥ n-1`. | Explicitly check `i >= n-1` before updating the answer. |
| **Ignoring the modulo in parity** | When you rotate, the expected bit flips parity. | Use `(i % 2)` on the *virtual* doubled string, not on the original index. |
| **Large space usage** | Storing the doubled string (`s + s`) would use O(2n) memory, unnecessary for the constraints. | Index into the original string using `i % n` – no explicit doubling needed. |

---

### 5.5 The Ugly – Edge Cases That Tripped My Interviewer

| Edge Case | Typical Mistake | What We Learned |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **All zeros or all ones** | Flipping cost can be `⌈n/2⌉`. Some solvers incorrectly report `0`. | Test both patterns; you’ll see that one pattern requires flipping every other bit. |
| **Odd‑length string** | For odd lengths, one pattern will always have one more mismatch. | Still take the min – no special handling needed. |
| **Very short string (`n = 1`)** | The window logic may skip because `n-1 = 0`. | Initialise `minFlips` to `1` (or `n+1`), and the loop will correctly handle the single character. |
| **Large `n` with many flips** | Using an `int` for mismatches is safe, but a `long` can be used to avoid accidental overflow if you ever extend the logic. | In Java, `int` is sufficient, but in languages like C++ use `int` or `long`. |
| **Reading input incorrectly** | Forgetting to strip whitespace in Python can lead to `ValueError`. | Use `s.strip()` or rely on LeetCode’s input wrapper which already passes clean strings. |

### 5.6 Solution Walkthrough (Sliding Window)

> Imagine the string `s = "11000"`.  
> If we “double” it virtually, we get `1100011000`.  
> A sliding window of length `5` that slides from index `0` to `9` covers **every rotation** exactly once.  

**Why does this work?**  
- When the window moves from `i` to `i+1`, we *add* the new character (the rightmost bit in the doubled string) and *remove* the leftmost one that is now out of bounds.  
- We maintain a counter `mis` that is the number of mismatches for the pattern that starts with `1`.  
- The pattern that starts with `0` is simply `n - mis`, because the total bits in the window are `n`.

When `i` reaches `n-1`, the window has exactly `n` characters – a full rotation.  
From that point, we can safely update the global minimum.

---

### 5.7 Java/Python/C++ Solutions

*(See Section 4. Reference Code above)*

> All three implementations share the same logic, only differing in syntax.  
> The key is to keep the sliding window logic **immutable** to the input string: `idx = i % n`.  
> This approach yields O(n) time, which passes the LeetCode tests for even the maximum input size.

---

### 5.8 Interview Follow‑Ups

> When the candidate masters the core problem, interviewers often ask variations:

1. **“What if you could only flip every `k`‑th bit?”**  
   – This introduces a generalized parity calculation.

2. **“Find the minimum number of flips to make the string alternating, but you can only flip at most `m` bits.”**  
   – This becomes a “circular array with budget” problem.

3. **“How would you modify the algorithm for a stream of bits?”**  
   – Discuss how to maintain the sliding window with constant memory when bits arrive one at a time.

> Demonstrating awareness of these variants shows that you understand *why* the solution works, not just *how* it does.

---

### 5.9 Conclusion

> LeetCode 1888 is more than just a string puzzle. It’s a microcosm of the kinds of problems that appear in high‑stakes interviews: clear objective, tight constraints, and a solution that rewards clean algorithmic thinking.  
> Master the sliding‑window trick, avoid the common pitfalls, and keep the edge cases in mind. With the Java, Python, and C++ implementations above, you’re now ready to tackle this problem – and perhaps even ask the interviewer what would happen if the string were **not binary**.

## 6. Final Thoughts

- The sliding‑window technique over a virtual doubled string is the heart of the solution.  
- Keep variable names explicit (`mis`, `expected`, `actual`) to avoid logical errors.  
- Test against edge cases: all zeros, odd lengths, maximum length, etc.  
- Once you understand this pattern, you can solve many more circular‑string problems with confidence.

Happy coding, and best of luck on your next interview!
