## 🔧 Code Solutions

### 1. Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public boolean mergeTriplets(int[][] triplets, int[] target) {
        int[] res = new int[3];          // running max
        for (int[] t : triplets) {
            // Skip any triplet that is “too big” in any dimension
            if (t[0] <= target[0] && t[1] <= target[1] && t[2] <= target[2]) {
                res[0] = Math.max(res[0], t[0]);
                res[1] = Math.max(res[1], t[1]);
                res[2] = Math.max(res[2], t[2]);
            }
        }
        return Arrays.equals(res, target);
    }
}
```

> **Why this works:**  
> *If a triplet exceeds the target in any dimension, it can never help you reach the target.*  
> We only merge “good” triplets, taking the component‑wise maximum. If the final maximum equals the target, the answer is `true`.

---

### 2. Python

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeTriplets(self, triplets: List[List[int]], target: List[int]) -> bool:
        res = [0, 0, 0]  # running max
        for t in triplets:
            if all(t[i] <= target[i] for i in range(3)):
                for i in range(3):
                    res[i] = max(res[i], t[i])
        return res == target
```

---

### 3. C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool mergeTriplets(vector<vector<int>>& triplets, vector<int>& target) {
        vector<int> res(3, 0);
        for (auto& t : triplets) {
            if (t[0] <= target[0] && t[1] <= target[1] && t[2] <= target[2]) {
                res[0] = max(res[0], t[0]);
                res[1] = max(res[1], t[1]);
                res[2] = max(res[2], t[2]);
            }
        }
        return res == target;
    }
};
```

---

> All three solutions run in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** extra space, where *n* = `triplets.length`.  
> They are easy to understand, easy to debug, and perfect for coding interviews.

### 1. Introduction

LeetCode’s “Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet” (problem #1899) is a **medium‑difficulty** challenge that appears on many interview stacks.  
It tests:

- **Greedy reasoning** – selecting only useful triplets.
- **Array manipulation** – component‑wise maximum.
- **Edge‑case awareness** – understanding constraints (triplets ≤ target).

Knowing how to crack this problem in **Java, Python, and C++** gives you a quick win on coding tests and a solid talking point for technical interviews.

---

### 2. Problem Statement

> **Input:**  
> `triplets`: `int[][]`, size *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 10⁵)  
> `target`: `int[]`, length 3  
> **Output:** `boolean` – whether the target can appear after a series of merge operations.

**Merge operation**: choose two indices `i` and `j` (`i ≠ j`) and replace `triplets[j]` with  
`[max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)]`.

**Goal:** Return `true` if any triplet can become exactly `target`.

---

### 3. The Greedy Insight (Good)

> **Observation 1** – A triplet that exceeds the target in *any* dimension can never help.  
> **Reason:** The `max` operation never decreases a value. If a component is already larger than the target’s, merging it can only make the result worse.

> **Observation 2** – If we keep merging all “good” triplets (≤ target), the resulting component‑wise maximum is the *best we can achieve*.

Thus a simple scan that:

1. **Filters** out “bad” triplets.  
2. **Keeps a running max** for each coordinate.  

is sufficient.

---

### 4. Code Walk‑through (Good)

#### Java
```java
int[] res = new int[3];          // running max
for (int[] t : triplets) {
    if (t[0] <= target[0] && t[1] <= target[1] && t[2] <= target[2]) {
        res[0] = Math.max(res[0], t[0]);
        res[1] = Math.max(res[1], t[1]);
        res[2] = Math.max(res[2], t[2]);
}
return Arrays.equals(res, target);
```

*Key points:*

- `t[0] <= target[0] && …` – explicit dimension check.  
- `Math.max` – component‑wise update.  
- `Arrays.equals` – final comparison.

#### Python
```python
res = [0, 0, 0]                  # running max
for t in triplets:
    if all(t[i] <= target[i] for i in range(3)):
        for i in range(3):
            res[i] = max(res[i], t[i])
return res == target
```

#### C++
```cpp
vector<int> res(3, 0);
for (auto& t : triplets) {
    if (t[0] <= target[0] && t[1] <= target[1] && t[2] <= target[2]) {
        res[0] = max(res[0], t[0]);
        res[1] = max(res[1], t[1]);
        res[2] = max(res[2], t[2]);
    }
}
return res == target;
```

> **Why it’s elegant:**  
> *Only one pass, no extra data structures, no complicated loops.*

### 5. Common Mistakes & Edge Cases (Bad)

| Mistake | Why It Happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Including “bad” triplets** | Forgetting the filter → false positives | Add the `<= target` guard |
| **Using `==` instead of `>=`** | Confusing “good” vs “optimal” | `t[i] <= target[i]` is the correct guard |
| **Over‑optimising with flags** | Tracking flags for each coordinate can be misleading if a single triplet covers two coordinates | The running max method is safer |
| **Misinterpreting constraints** | Assuming *n* is tiny → using O(n²) double loops | Always aim for linear‑time scanning |

---

### 6. Advanced Alternatives (Ugly)

> Some candidates try to over‑engineer:
> - **Dynamic programming** on state space of 3 coordinates → exponential memory.  
> - **Breadth‑first search** over all possible merges → O(n²) worst‑case.  
> - **Recursive backtracking** to try every merge order → 10⁵! possibilities.

These approaches are **unnecessary**; they blow up on the largest test case and are not interview‑friendly.

---

### 7. Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Java / Python / C++ |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Time** | **O(n)** – one linear scan. |
| **Space** | **O(1)** – only 3 integer variables. |

> **Why O(n) is optimal?**  
> Each triplet must be examined at least once to confirm it is “good” or not. There is no faster algorithm because the input itself is linear in size.

---

### 8. Interview Strategy

1. **Explain the greedy observation** first – this shows you understand the core logic.  
2. **Walk through the code** while highlighting the filter and the running max.  
3. **Discuss edge cases** – e.g., all triplets exceed the target → answer `false`.  
4. **Answer follow‑up questions** (can you modify the algorithm if target length > 3? → still same idea).  
5. **Write clean, idiomatic code** – choose one of the provided snippets.

If time is tight, start with the three‑line Python solution; if you’re in a Java interview, the array‑based version is often preferred.

---

### 9. Takeaway

- **LeetCode 1899** is a textbook greedy problem.  
- A single pass that **filters out “bad” triplets** and **tracks a running maximum** solves it in linear time.  
- Avoid over‑engineering; stick to the greedy solution unless the interviewer explicitly asks for a different approach.  
- Use the code snippets as a cheat‑sheet for your next interview or online coding test.

> 🚀 **Next step:** Run the solutions on LeetCode, add the `Solution` class to your local project, and practice explaining the logic aloud. You’ll feel confident tackling similar “max‑merge” problems on any tech interview.
