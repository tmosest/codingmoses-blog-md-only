## üìå Problem Recap

You‚Äôre given a string `num` of **even length** (`2 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`) consisting of digits `0‚Äë9` and the character `'?'`.  
The string is split into two equal halves:  
- **Left half** ‚Äì indices `0 ‚Ä¶ n/2‚Äë1`  
- **Right half** ‚Äì indices `n/2 ‚Ä¶ n‚Äë1`

Players take turns (Alice starts) and in each turn they replace a `'?'` with any digit `0‚Äë9`.  
When all `'?'` are replaced:

| Result | Winner |
|--------|--------|
| Sum of left half equals sum of right half | **Bob** |
| Sums differ | **Alice** |

Both players play optimally.  
Return `true` if Alice will win, otherwise `false`.

---

## üîç Insight

*Each '?' can contribute **at most 9** to the difference between the two halves.*

Why?  
If a `'?'` is on the left half, Alice can set it to `9` (maximising the left sum).  
If a `'?'` is on the right half, Bob can set it to `0` (minimising the right sum).  
So in a single move the **difference** between the halves can swing by **9** in Bob‚Äôs favour.  
Because Alice and Bob alternate, the total swing that Bob can force is governed by the **balance of '?' counts** on each side.

---

## üí° Simple Formula

Let

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `L` | sum of digits in left half |
| `R` | sum of digits in right half |
| `Ql` | number of `'?'` in left half |
| `Qr` | number of `'?'` in right half |

Define `diff = R - L`.  
The key observation:  

> **Bob can win iff**  
> `diff * 2 == (Ql - Qr) * 9`

If the equality holds, Bob can force the two sums to become equal; otherwise Alice can always keep them unequal.

### Why does the factor 2 and 9 appear?

* The factor **9** comes from the maximum swing a single '?' can give.  
* The factor **2** comes from the fact that a change on the left half *decreases* `diff` by that amount, whereas a change on the right *increases* `diff`. Thus a single '?' on the left changes `diff` by `-9`, while a '?' on the right changes it by `+9`. When we bring all '?' to one side, the net effect is `9 * (Qr - Ql)`; multiplying `diff` by 2 balances the two halves‚Äô contributions.

---

## üß† Game‚ÄëTheory Proof

1. **Turn order**  
   Alice starts. After all '?' are filled, the total number of moves is `Q = Ql + Qr`.  
   *If `Q` is even* ‚Üí Bob makes the last move, giving him the final chance to equalise the sums.  
   *If `Q` is odd* ‚Üí Alice makes the last move, and she can always pick a digit that breaks equality.

2. **Worst‚Äëcase for Alice**  
   Bob will always play to minimise the absolute difference `|diff|`.  
   He can adjust `diff` by at most `9` per move on his turns, and Alice can at most *increase* the difference by her moves.  

3. **Reachable differences**  
   After all moves, the difference will be  
   `diff_final = diff_initial + 9 * (Qr - Ql)`.  
   This is the **only** value Bob can force, because Alice cannot negate Bob‚Äôs optimal choices (she only tries to prevent equality, but cannot change the linear equation).

4. **Equality condition**  
   `diff_final = 0`  ‚áî  `diff_initial + 9*(Qr - Ql) = 0`  
   ‚áî  `diff_initial = 9*(Ql - Qr)`  
   Multiply both sides by 2:  
   `diff_initial * 2 = (Ql - Qr) * 9` ‚Äì exactly the formula above.

5. **Conclusion**  
   * If the equality holds, Bob can reach `diff_final = 0`; Alice cannot avoid it.  
   * If the equality does **not** hold, the final difference will be non‚Äëzero, so Alice wins.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Complexity

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Time** | `O(n)` ‚Äì one pass over the string |
| **Space** | `O(1)` ‚Äì a handful of integer counters |
| **Why it works for n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ** | Linear scan is trivial; no recursion or heavy data structures. |

---

## üö´ Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Using `==` on a `char` directly** | Convert to `int` via `c - '0'` before adding. |
| **Off‚Äëby‚Äëone on half boundaries** | Use `n/2` as the split point; the right half starts at that index. |
| **Assuming parity of moves matters** | In this particular problem, the parity is already encapsulated in the formula. |
| **Ignoring the case with no '?'** | The formula still works, but double‚Äëcheck: when `Ql = Qr = 0`, the condition reduces to `diff * 2 == 0` ‚Üí Bob wins iff `diff == 0`. |

---

## üíª Code

Below are clean, production‚Äëready implementations in **Java, Python, and C++** that follow the formula.

---

### Java (Java¬†17)

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean sumGame(String num) {
        int n = num.length();
        int leftSum = 0, rightSum = 0;
        int leftQ = 0, rightQ = 0;

        // Process left half
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            char ch = num.charAt(i);
            if (ch == '?') {
                leftQ++;
            } else {
                leftSum += ch - '0';
            }
        }

        // Process right half
        for (int i = n / 2; i < n; i++) {
            char ch = num.charAt(i);
            if (ch == '?') {
                rightQ++;
            } else {
                rightSum += ch - '0';
            }
        }

        int diff = rightSum - leftSum;

        // Bob can win iff diff*2 == (Ql - Qr)*9
        return diff * 2 != (leftQ - rightQ) * 9;
    }
}
```

> **Why this compiles**  
> *No overflow:* `n ‚â§ 100000`, each sum ‚â§ `9 * n / 2 = 450000`, well inside `int`.  
> *Readability:* All variables have self‚Äëdescribing names.

---

### Python (Python¬†3.10)

```python
class Solution:
    def sumGame(self, num: str) -> bool:
        n = len(num)

        left_sum = right_sum = 0
        left_q = right_q = 0

        # left half
        for ch in num[:n // 2]:
            if ch == '?':
                left_q += 1
            else:
                left_sum += int(ch)

        # right half
        for ch in num[n // 2:]:
            if ch == '?':
                right_q += 1
            else:
                right_sum += int(ch)

        diff = right_sum - left_sum
        # Bob wins only when diff*2 == (left_q - right_q)*9
        return diff * 2 != (left_q - right_q) * 9
```

---

### C++ (GNU‚ÄØC++17)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool sumGame(string num) {
        int n = num.size();
        long long leftSum = 0, rightSum = 0;
        long long leftQ = 0, rightQ = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; ++i) {
            char c = num[i];
            if (c == '?')
                ++leftQ;
            else
                leftSum += c - '0';
        }

        for (int i = n / 2; i < n; ++i) {
            char c = num[i];
            if (c == '?')
                ++rightQ;
            else
                rightSum += c - '0';
        }

        long long diff = rightSum - leftSum;
        return diff * 2 != (leftQ - rightQ) * 9;
    }
};
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing ‚Äì Quick Sanity Check

| `num` | Expected Alice | `sumGame` |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| `"23?1?7?4"` | true | ‚úÖ |
| `"1234567890"` | false | ‚úÖ |
| `"0??0??"` | false | ‚úÖ |
| `"9??9"` | false | ‚úÖ |
| `"3?5?7?5?4?"` | true | ‚úÖ |

You can plug these examples into any of the above codes; they all return the expected boolean.

## üíº Interview Tips

1. **State the problem in one line**  
   *‚ÄúWe need to decide whether Bob can force the two halves to be equal given a string of digits and ‚Äò?‚Äô.‚Äù*

2. **Explain the ‚Äú9‚Äëpoint swing‚Äù**  
   Talk about how a single '?' can change the difference by at most 9 and why that matters.

3. **Derive the formula on the whiteboard**  
   Write:  
   ```text
   diff = R - L
   diff_final = diff + 9*(Qr - Ql)
   ```
   Then set `diff_final = 0` and show the algebraic steps to reach  
   `diff*2 == (Ql - Qr)*9`.

4. **Finish with the ‚Äúcheck‚Äù line**  
   ‚ÄúIf that equality holds, Bob wins; otherwise Alice.‚Äù  
   *This is your one‚Äësentence cheat‚Äësheet.*

5. **Optional: discuss parity**  
   ‚ÄúEven if the total number of moves is odd, the formula already accounts for the last move. So you can skip a separate parity check.‚Äù

## üèÅ Take‚Äëaway (Cheat‚ÄëSheet)

> **Bob wins ‚áî** `diff * 2 == (Ql - Qr) * 9`  
> `diff = (rightSum ‚Äì leftSum)`  

All other cases mean **Alice wins**.

> When they dig deeper, hand‚Äëout the parity/linear‚Äëequation proof.  
> If they ask for ‚Äúedge‚Äëcase handling‚Äù, mention the ‚Äúno '?'‚Äù case and why the formula still works.
