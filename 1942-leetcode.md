## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Overview

At a party there are *infinite* chairs numbered 0‚Ä¶‚àû.  
When a friend arrives, they always sit on the **smallest un‚Äëoccupied** chair.  
When a friend leaves, that chair becomes free immediately, and a new arrival at the *same* time can use it.

You are given `times[i] = [arrival_i, leave_i]` for `n` friends (`1 ‚â§ arrival_i < leave_i ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`).  
All arrival times are distinct.  
`targetFriend` is the index of the friend whose chair you must return.

> **Return** the chair number that `targetFriend` will occupy.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Intuition

The natural data‚Äëstructures for this problem are **priority queues** (heaps):

| Purpose | What we store | How it works |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| `availableSeats` | chair numbers | always gives the smallest free chair |
| `occupiedSeats` | `(leaveTime, chair)` | always gives the next chair to be freed |

We process friends **in order of arrival time**.  
Before seating a friend we ‚Äúfree‚Äù every chair whose `leaveTime ‚â§ currentArrival`.  
Then we seat the friend on the smallest free chair.

This is the classic ‚Äútwo‚Äëheap‚Äù solution that runs in **O(n log n)** time and **O(n)** space.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Solution Code

### 3.1 Python (9‚Äëline clean implementation)

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def smallestChair(self, times: List[List[int]], targetFriend: int) -> int:
        # Order friends by arrival time
        order = sorted(range(len(times)), key=lambda i: times[i][0])

        # All chairs 0‚Ä¶n-1 are initially free
        available = list(range(len(times)))
        heapq.heapify(available)

        # Min‚Äëheap of (leaveTime, chair)
        occupied = []

        for i in order:
            arrival, leave = times[i]

            # Free all chairs that become available before this arrival
            while occupied and occupied[0][0] <= arrival:
                _, chair = heapq.heappop(occupied)
                heapq.heappush(available, chair)

            # Seat the friend
            chair = heapq.heappop(available)
            if i == targetFriend:
                return chair

            # Mark chair as occupied until 'leave'
            heapq.heappush(occupied, (leave, chair))
```

### 3.2 Java (PriorityQueue version)

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int smallestChair(int[][] times, int targetFriend) {
        int n = times.length;
        // Order friends by arrival time
        Integer[] order = new Integer[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) order[i] = i;
        Arrays.sort(order, Comparator.comparingInt(i -> times[i][0]));

        // Available chairs ‚Äì min‚Äëheap
        PriorityQueue<Integer> free = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) free.offer(i);

        // Occupied chairs ‚Äì (leaveTime, chair)
        PriorityQueue<int[]> occupied = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));

        for (int idx : order) {
            int arrive = times[idx][0];
            int leave  = times[idx][1];

            // Release chairs whose leaveTime <= arrive
            while (!occupied.isEmpty() && occupied.peek()[0] <= arrive) {
                free.offer(occupied.poll()[1]);
            }

            int chair = free.poll();              // smallest free chair
            if (idx == targetFriend) return chair;

            occupied.offer(new int[]{leave, chair});
        }
        return -1; // unreachable for valid input
    }
}
```

### 3.3 C++ (priority_queue version)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int smallestChair(vector<vector<int>>& times, int targetFriend) {
        int n = times.size();

        // Order friends by arrival time
        vector<int> order(n);
        iota(order.begin(), order.end(), 0);
        sort(order.begin(), order.end(),
             [&](int a, int b){ return times[a][0] < times[b][0]; });

        // Available chairs ‚Äì min-heap
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> free;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) free.push(i);

        // Occupied chairs ‚Äì (leaveTime, chair)
        priority_queue<pair<int,int>, vector<pair<int,int>>, greater<pair<int,int>>> occupied;

        for (int idx : order) {
            int arrive = times[idx][0];
            int leave  = times[idx][1];

            // Free chairs whose leaveTime <= arrive
            while (!occupied.empty() && occupied.top().first <= arrive) {
                free.push(occupied.top().second);
                occupied.pop();
            }

            int chair = free.top(); free.pop();
            if (idx == targetFriend) return chair;

            occupied.emplace(leave, chair);
        }
        return -1; // never reached
    }
};
```

All three solutions run in **O(n log n)** time and use **O(n)** extra memory.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ The Good, The Bad, The Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Time complexity** | Optimal for the constraints (`n ‚â§ 10‚Å¥`) | Still `O(n log n)` even if we only care about a single friend | There are slower O(n¬≤) greedy approaches that will TLE |
| **Space complexity** | Linear (`O(n)`) | Still needs two heaps | Avoids storing all arrival times ‚Äì we only keep `n` chairs |
| **Corner case** | Handles simultaneous leave & arrive correctly because we free first | Forgetting to free before seating may give wrong chair | If we used a single heap for both available & occupied, we would break the rule |
| **Readability** | Short, clear code | Requires understanding of heaps and tuple handling | Overly complex if you mix data structures together |
| **Language support** | Python `heapq`, Java `PriorityQueue`, C++ `priority_queue` | All three have built‚Äëin min‚Äëheap support | No built‚Äëin ‚Äúmin‚Äëheap‚Äù in some older languages (C needs custom comparator) |

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Why This Approach Rocks for Interviews

1. **Clear algorithmic idea** ‚Äì ‚Äúfree before seat‚Äù is easy to explain.  
2. **Scales** ‚Äì `O(n log n)` is acceptable for 10‚Å¥ elements; interviewers will be impressed.  
3. **Data‚Äëstructure showcase** ‚Äì you demonstrate knowledge of priority queues, heaps, and custom comparators.  
4. **Edge‚Äëcase coverage** ‚Äì simultaneous events are a common pitfall; you handle them explicitly.  
5. **Language agnostic** ‚Äì you can swap Java ‚ÜîÔ∏è C++ ‚ÜîÔ∏è Python without changing the core logic.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Variants & Extensions

- **Multiple parties** ‚Äì run the algorithm for each test case.  
- **Dynamic arrival times** ‚Äì keep an event queue (arrival & leave events) sorted by time.  
- **Fixed number of chairs** ‚Äì replace the ‚Äúavailable seats‚Äù heap with a simple integer counter.  
- **Random chair assignment** ‚Äì switch to a max‚Äëheap to give the largest free chair.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Take‚Äëaway & How to Land That Job

1. **Practice the 2‚Äëheap pattern** ‚Äì you‚Äôll use it for seating, parking, scheduling, and more.  
2. **Explain the ‚Äúfree‚Äëbefore‚Äëseat‚Äù step** ‚Äì interviewers love clear reasoning.  
3. **Write clean, commented code** ‚Äì show maintainability.  
4. **Show the big‚ÄëO analysis** ‚Äì interviewers ask for it; you‚Äôll impress.  
5. **Mention real‚Äëworld analogies** ‚Äì ‚Äúparking lot, hotel rooms, CPU cores‚Äù ‚Äì makes the problem relatable.
