## 1. Problem Recap

You‚Äôre at a party where **n** friends (0‚Ä¶n‚Äë1) arrive and leave at distinct times.  
Chairs are numbered from **0** to **‚àû**.  
When a friend arrives, he/she always takes the *smallest* currently free chair.

Given:

| times[i] = `[arrival_i, leaving_i]` | `targetFriend` |
|--------------------------------------|----------------|

**Return** the chair number that the `targetFriend` will occupy.

*Example*  
`times = [[1,4],[2,3],[4,6]] , targetFriend = 1` ‚Üí **1**

## 2. Why This Problem Is a Gold‚ÄëMine for Interviews

| ‚úÖ Good | ‚ùå Bad | ‚ö° Ugly |
|---------|-------|--------|
| *Requires* a mix of **sorting** + **priority queues** | *No* brute‚Äëforce solution works for `n = 10‚Å¥` | *Na√Øve simulation* (O(n¬≤)) will get you timed‚Äëout |
| *Demonstrates* understanding of **events** (arrival vs. departure) | *Mis‚Äëreading* ‚Äúdistinct arrival times‚Äù ‚Üí O(n log n) still valid | *Confusing* ‚Äúchair becomes free at the same moment‚Äù ‚Üí must treat leaving ‚â§ arrival as free |
| *Shows* *clean* code ‚Äì 9 lines in Python ‚Äì that is easy to read | *Requires* careful heap operations | *Edge‚Äëcase*: a friend may arrive exactly when another leaves ‚Äì priority queue must handle it |

Recruiters love this problem because it tests:

* **Greedy mindset** ‚Äì always pick the smallest free seat.  
* **Data‚Äëstructure knowledge** ‚Äì priority queue (min‚Äëheap).  
* **Time‚Äëspace trade‚Äëoffs** ‚Äì O(n log n) vs. O(n¬≤).  
* **Clean coding style** ‚Äì fewer lines ‚Üí fewer bugs.

---

## 3. Core Idea

1. **Sort friends by arrival time** ‚Äì because events are processed chronologically.
2. **Two priority queues**  
   * `freeSeats` ‚Äì min‚Äëheap of seat numbers that are currently free.  
   * `occupied` ‚Äì min‚Äëheap of pairs `(leavingTime, seatNumber)`.  
   When a friend leaves, we pop from `occupied` while its `leavingTime` ‚â§ current arrival and push that seat back into `freeSeats`.
3. **Assign** the smallest free seat to the arriving friend.  
4. **Record** the chair of the `targetFriend`.  
5. **Add** the pair `(leavingTime, seat)` to `occupied`.

Complexity:  
*Sorting* ‚Üí **O(n log n)**  
*Each heap operation* ‚Üí **O(log n)**, done twice per friend ‚Üí still **O(n log n)**.  
Space: two heaps ‚Üí **O(n)**.

                return seat

            # 6Ô∏è‚É£ Mark seat as occupied until `leave`
            heapq.heappush(occupied, (leave, seat))
```

> **Why 9 lines?**  
> All the heavy lifting happens inside the heap operations. The logic is explicit, no extra functions, no loops inside loops.

        int n = times.length;
        Integer[] order = new Integer[n];

        Arrays.sort(order, Comparator.comparingInt(i -> times[i][0]));

        PriorityQueue<Integer> free = new PriorityQueue<>();          // free seats
        PriorityQueue<int[]> busy = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0])); // [leave, seat]

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) free.offer(i);                    // initially all seats free

        for (int idx : order) {
            int arrive = times[idx][0], leave = times[idx][1];

            while (!busy.isEmpty() && busy.peek()[0] <= arrive) {
                free.offer(busy.poll()[1]);                          // seat becomes free
            }

            int seat = free.poll();                                  // smallest free seat
            if (idx == targetFriend) return seat;
            busy.offer(new int[]{leave, seat});                      // mark seat occupied
        }
        return -1; // never reached
    }
}
```

> **Notes**  
> * `Integer[] order` is used because we cannot sort primitive int arrays with a comparator.  
> * `int[]` in `busy` stores `(leaveTime, seatNumber)`; Java‚Äôs priority queue requires a comparator for arrays.

## 5. Edge‚ÄëCase Checklist

| Case | What to watch for | Why it matters |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Friend arrives exactly when another leaves** | `occupied.top().first <= arrive` (‚â§ not <) | The leaving chair becomes free **at** that instant. |
| **Multiple friends arrive at the same time** | Problem guarantees *distinct* arrival times ‚Üí no conflict. |
| **All chairs are taken** | `freeSeats` will be empty only when `n` chairs are used, but we always push the earliest freed seat back before assignment. |
| **Large input (10‚Å¥ friends)** | Heap operations are O(log n), still fast. Avoid O(n¬≤) simulation. |

### 6.1 Introduction

If you‚Äôre preparing for software engineering interviews, *LeetCode 1942 ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Number of the Smallest Unoccupied Chair‚Äù* is a must‚Äësolve.  
It‚Äôs a classic greedy‚Äë+‚Äëpriority‚Äëqueue problem that tests your ability to:

* Turn a real‚Äëworld scenario (party chairs) into a data‚Äëstructure problem.
* Keep track of time‚Äëbased events efficiently.
* Write clean, production‚Äëready code in multiple languages.

Below you‚Äôll find a step‚Äëby‚Äëstep walk‚Äëthrough of the problem, the optimal algorithm, and **ready‚Äëto‚Äëcopy** solutions in Python, Java, and C++. Plus, we‚Äôll explain why recruiters love this problem and how solving it can boost your hiring prospects.

### 6.2 Problem Summary

> *Given an array of `[arrival, leaving]` times for each friend and a target friend index, return the chair number the target friend will sit on, following the rule that each new friend takes the smallest free chair.*

Key constraints:  
- `2 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Å¥`  
- `1 ‚â§ arrival < leaving ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`  
- All arrival times are unique.

---

### 6.3 The Greedy Insight

At any moment the **smallest free chair** is the *best* choice for a newcomer.  
If we can always know which chairs are free and which are occupied, we can process friends in chronological order and assign chairs optimally.

The real challenge is *updating* the set of free chairs efficiently when people leave.  
A min‚Äëheap (priority queue) naturally keeps track of the ‚Äúnext seat to free‚Äù and the ‚Äúlowest free seat‚Äù.

---

### 6.4 Optimal Algorithm

1. **Sort** all friends by arrival time.  
2. **Free** seats: a min‚Äëheap of seat numbers.  
3. **Occupied** seats: a min‚Äëheap of `(leavingTime, seatNumber)`.  
4. **Process each arrival**:  
   * Release all seats whose leaving time ‚â§ current arrival.  
   * Pop the smallest seat from `free`.  
   * Push `(leaving, seat)` onto `occupied`.  
5. **Return** the seat once the target friend is processed.

Both heaps guarantee **O(log n)** operations; sorting gives the dominant **O(n log n)** time.

---

### 6.4 Reference Code (Python)

```python
import heapq
class Solution:
    def smallestChair(self, times, targetFriend):
        order = sorted(range(len(times)), key=lambda i: times[i][0])
        free, busy = list(range(len(times))), []
        for i in order:
            a, b = times[i]
            while busy and busy[0][0] <= a:
                heapq.heappush(free, heapq.heappop(busy)[1])
            seat = heapq.heappop(free)
            if i == targetFriend: return seat
            heapq.heappush(busy, (b, seat))
```

### 6.7 Why Recruiters Prefer This Problem

1. **Greedy + Min‚ÄëHeap** ‚Üí shows a clear problem‚Äësolving strategy.  
2. **Time‚Äëevent simulation** ‚Üí tests your grasp of ‚Äúwhen to release‚Äù and ‚Äúwhen to occupy‚Äù.  
3. **Distinct arrival times** ‚Üí forces the solver to think about ordering.  
4. **Compact code** ‚Äì fewer lines ‚Üí fewer edge‚Äëcase bugs.

When you nail this problem, you demonstrate to hiring managers that you:

* Understand the *why* behind greedy choices.  
* Know how to maintain **state over time** using priority queues.  
* Write clean, maintainable code that would fit into a production codebase.
