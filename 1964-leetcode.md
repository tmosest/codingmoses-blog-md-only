        ## 1️⃣ Solution Overview – “Longest Valid Obstacle Course at Each Position”

The goal: for every index *i* in the array `obstacles`, we need the length of the longest non‑decreasing subsequence that

1. **must contain `obstacles[i]`**,
2. only uses elements from `0 … i`, and
3. keeps the original order.

The classic Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) technique can be adapted to give the answer for **each** prefix in *O(n log n)* time.

---

### How it works

* Keep an auxiliary array `dp` of the smallest possible tail value for an increasing subsequence of each length.
  * `dp[len]` = the smallest ending value of an increasing subsequence of length `len+1` seen so far.
* For every obstacle `x = obstacles[i]`:
  1. Find the first index `pos` in `dp` where `dp[pos] > x` (or `x` can extend the longest suffix).  
     This is a classic binary‑search operation (`upper_bound`/`lower_bound`).
  2. `pos` is the length of the longest subsequence that ends **with** `x`.  
     Store `pos+1` in the answer array.
  3. Replace `dp[pos]` with `x` – we now have a better (smaller) tail for that length.

Because `dp` is always sorted, the binary search stays **O(log n)** per element, giving a total **O(n log n)** algorithm.

The space usage is *O(n)* (the answer array + `dp`).

---

### Good 👍

* Runs in *O(n log n)*, beating the naive *O(n²)* DP.  
* Works with the maximum constraints (`obstacles.length ≤ 2·10⁵`, each value up to `10⁹`).  
* Completely deterministic – no randomisation or “best‑case / worst‑case” variance.  
* Easy to reason about once you know the LIS trick.

### Bad 👎

* Requires an understanding of LIS and the use of binary search.  
  For a junior candidate who only knows the O(n²) DP, the solution might look “magical”.
* The binary‑search step is slightly error‑prone (off‑by‑one bugs).  
  A single typo (using `<` instead of `≤` in the comparison) will break the guarantee that every prefix is non‑decreasing.

### Ugly 🚫

* If you try to solve it with a *segment tree / Fenwick tree* that keeps the “maximum length seen so far for each value”, you will end up with a more complicated data structure, higher constant factors, and a larger memory footprint.
* A naive *O(n²)* DP is simple but will TLE on the largest test cases – a big no‑no for production code.

## 2️⃣ Reference Implementations

Below are clean, production‑ready implementations for **Java 17**, **Python 3.10+**, and **C++17**.  
All three use the same binary‑search LIS idea described above.

> **Tip** – When you’re preparing for an interview, bring the “dp + binary search” pattern on your cheat sheet; it shows you’re comfortable with classical algorithmic tools.

### 2.1 Java 17

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int[] longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition(int[] obstacles) {
        int n = obstacles.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];          // dp[i] = smallest tail of a non‑decreasing subsequence of length i+1
        int len = 0;                    // current longest length
        int[] ans = new int[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int x = obstacles[i];

            // binary search for the first dp[pos] > x
            int pos = Arrays.binarySearch(dp, 0, len, x + 1);
            if (pos < 0) pos = -pos - 1;   // upper_bound(x)

            ans[i] = pos + 1;          // answer for this prefix
            dp[pos] = x;               // update dp

            if (pos == len) len++;     // we extended the longest subsequence
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Python 3.10+

```python
from bisect import bisect_right
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition(self, obstacles: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        dp = []          # dp[i] = smallest tail for length i+1
        ans = []

        for x in obstacles:
            # position where x can be placed (first dp[pos] > x)
            pos = bisect_right(dp, x)
            ans.append(pos + 1)
            # maintain dp
            if pos == len(dp):
                dp.append(x)
            else:
                dp[pos] = x
        return ans
```

---

### 2.3 C++17

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition(vector<int>& obstacles) {
        vector<int> dp;          // smallest tail for each length
        vector<int> ans;
        ans.reserve(obstacles.size());

        for (int x : obstacles) {
            // upper_bound finds first element > x
            auto it = upper_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), x);
            int pos = it - dp.begin();   // 0‑based length
            ans.push_back(pos + 1);
            if (it == dp.end())
                dp.push_back(x);
            else
                *it = x;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

> **Why `upper_bound`?**  
> Because the subsequence must be **non‑decreasing**.  
> With `upper_bound(x)` we guarantee that all tails are ≤ `x` up to `pos‑1`, so inserting `x` at `pos` keeps the subsequence non‑decreasing.
