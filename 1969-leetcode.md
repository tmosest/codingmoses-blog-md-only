        ## 🎯 LeetCode 1969 – Minimum Non‑Zero Product of the Array Elements  
> *A mathematically elegant solution that runs in O(p) time*  

---

### 1. Problem Recap

You’re given a positive integer **p**.  
Consider the array `nums` (1‑indexed) that contains **all** numbers from `1` to `2^p – 1` in binary form.  
You may repeatedly choose two numbers `x` and `y` from `nums` and swap a *corresponding* bit (same position) between them.  
The goal is to make the product of all array elements **as small as possible** – but the product must be **non‑zero**.  
Return the minimum product modulo **10⁹ + 7**.

> **Constraints**  
> `1 ≤ p ≤ 60`  

---

### 2. Intuition

- Every bit position in the whole multiset `nums` contains exactly **2^(p‑1)** ones – this is just a property of binary numbers 1…2^p–1.  
- Swapping bits never changes the *total* number of 1‑bits in any column.  
- If we could gather all 1‑bits of every column except the least significant one into a *single* number, that number would become `2^p – 2` (all bits 1 except the lowest).  
- The remaining numbers would be `1` (only the lowest bit set) and `2^p – 1` (all bits 1).  
- The product then is  
  \[
  (2^p-2)^{\frac{2^p-2}{2}}\;\times\;(2^p-1)
  \]
  because there are exactly `2^p-2` numbers that are not the largest one, half of them become `2^p-2` and the other half become `1`.

The key question is: **Can we prove this configuration is optimal?**  
Yes – the official solution shows that any deviation would allow a swap that strictly decreases the product. The proof uses a clever case analysis on the *lowest* set bit of numbers in the lower part of the array (`L`) and the highest part (`H`). The details are omitted here, but the bottom line is that the configuration above is the unique optimal one.

### 3. Algorithm

1. **Special case**  
   - If `p == 1`, `nums = [1]` → product is `1`.  
2. Let `q = 2^p – 2`.  
3. Compute `pow(q, q/2)` modulo `MOD`.  
   - Because `q` can be far larger than `MOD`, first reduce `q` modulo `MOD`.  
   - The exponent `q/2` can be reduced modulo `MOD-1` (Fermat’s little theorem, since `MOD` is prime).  
4. Multiply the result by `q + 1` modulo `MOD`.  
5. Return the value.

The whole algorithm is **O(p)** time (to compute `2^p` and the power) and **O(1)** memory.

### 4. Code

Below are concise, production‑ready implementations in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.

> **Tip** – For readability the code is split into helper functions (power, modulo multiplication, etc.).  
> **Edge cases** – All handle the `p == 1` corner case.

#### 4.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private static final long MOD = 1_000_000_007L;

    // fast exponentiation: base^exp mod MOD
    private static long modPow(long base, long exp) {
        base %= MOD;
        long res = 1;
        while (exp > 0) {
            if ((exp & 1) == 1) res = (res * base) % MOD;
            base = (base * base) % MOD;
            exp >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }

    public int minNonZeroProduct(int p) {
        if (p == 1) return 1;                 // special case
        long q = (1L << p) - 2;               // 2^p - 2
        long half = q >> 1;                   // q / 2
        long power = modPow(q % MOD, half % (MOD - 1)); // Fermat reduction
        long result = (power * ((q + 1) % MOD)) % MOD;
        return (int) result;
    }
}
```

#### 4.2 Python

```python
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

def min_non_zero_product(p: int) -> int:
    if p == 1:
        return 1
    q = (1 << p) - 2                    # 2^p - 2
    half = q >> 1                       # q // 2
    # Fermat: exponent can be reduced modulo MOD-1
    power = pow(q % MOD, half % (MOD - 1), MOD)
    return (power * ((q + 1) % MOD)) % MOD
```

---

#### 4.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long MOD = 1'000'000'007LL;

long long mod_pow(long long base, long long exp) {
    base %= MOD;
    long long res = 1;
    while (exp) {
        if (exp & 1) res = res * base % MOD;
        base = base * base % MOD;
        exp >>= 1;
    }
    return res;
}

int minNonZeroProduct(int p) {
    if (p == 1) return 1;
    long long q = (1LL << p) - 2;      // 2^p - 2
    long long half = q >> 1;           // q / 2
    long long power = mod_pow(q % MOD, half % (MOD - 1));
    return int((power * ((q + 1) % MOD)) % MOD);
}
```

- It’s a **perfect showcase** on a resume: “I solved a 60‑bit combinatorial optimization problem with O(1) space.”

#### 5.2.1 The Good – What You’ll Love

| ✔️ Feature | Why it’s awesome |
|-----------|------------------|
| **No loops over 2^p numbers** | You never build the huge array – you just compute a power. |
| **Time & Space O(p)** | Even for p = 60 the algorithm is instant. |
| **Elegant proof** | The optimal configuration is unique; any deviation leads to a product‑decreasing swap. |
| **Reusable** | The same math applies to other “minimize product with bit swaps” tasks. |
| **Cross‑language** | Ready‑to‑copy Java/Python/C++ code fits every stack‑exchange or job‑hunt portfolio. |

#### 5.2.2 The Bad – Things That Might Trip You Up

- **Large intermediate values** – `2^p` quickly outgrows 64‑bit integers, but the shift trick `(1L << p)` still works up to p=60.  
- **Modular exponent** – Remember Fermat’s theorem; otherwise you’ll overflow or get wrong results.  
- **Special case p=1** – Don’t forget it; otherwise the formula collapses to 0.

#### 5.2.3 The Ugly – When the “Brute Force” Fails

If you naïvely try to simulate swaps, you’ll be stuck:

1. `nums` has **2^p – 1** elements – for `p = 30` that’s > 1 billion.  
2. Every swap operation is O(1), but enumerating all possibilities is **exponential** – completely infeasible.  
3. Even a dynamic‑programming or back‑tracking approach will choke on the enormous state space.

The “ugly” part is that **without a mathematical insight** you’re left with a combinatorial explosion. The key to beating the ugly is *recognizing the invariant*: the number of ones in each bit column is fixed. That invariant turns the problem from “search” into “re‑arrangement” and then into a pure algebraic expression.

### 6. Take‑away Checklist

- ✅ Special‑case `p = 1`.  
- ✅ Compute `q = 2^p – 2`.  
- ✅ `result = q^(q/2) * (q+1) mod 1e9+7`.  
- ✅ Reduce exponent modulo `MOD-1` (Fermat).  
- ✅ Test with `p = 60` → still runs in < 0.1 ms.
