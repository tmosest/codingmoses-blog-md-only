        ## üõ†Ô∏è 1. Code ‚Äì Three Languages

Below are **fully‚Äëworking** implementations for LeetCode **1974 ‚Äì Minimum Time to Type Word Using Special Typewriter** in **Java, Python 3, and C++**.  
All solutions share the same logic:  
*Keep track of the current pointer position (initially `'a'`), compute the clockwise and counter‚Äëclockwise distance to the next character, take the smaller one, add it to the running total, then add‚ÄØ1‚ÄØsecond for the ‚Äútype‚Äù operation.*

| Language | File | Code |
|----------|------|------|
| **Java** | `Solution.java` |  |
| **Python** | `solution.py` |  |
| **C++** | `solution.cpp` |  |

### Java ‚Äì `Solution.java`

```java
public class Solution {
    /**
     * Returns the minimum number of seconds to type the given word
     * on the circular typewriter.
     *
     * @param word a string consisting only of lowercase English letters
     * @return total time in seconds
     */
    public int minTimeToType(String word) {
        int time = 0;          // total time spent
        char current = 'a';    // pointer starts at 'a'

        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            char target = word.charAt(i);
            int diff = Math.abs(target - current);   // clockwise distance
            int move = Math.min(diff, 26 - diff);    // shortest way
            time += move + 1;                        // move + type
            current = target;                       // update pointer
        }
        return time;
    }
}
```

### Python ‚Äì `solution.py`

```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToType(self, word: str) -> int:
        """
        Computes the minimum number of seconds needed to type
        the given word on a circular keyboard.

        Parameters
        ----------
        word : str
            Lowercase English letters only.

        Returns
        -------
        int
            Total time in seconds.
        """
        time = 0
        current = 'a'

        for target in word:
            diff = abs(ord(target) - ord(current))
            move = min(diff, 26 - diff)
            time += move + 1      # move + type
            current = target

        return time
```

---

### C++ ‚Äì `solution.cpp`

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToType(string word) {
        int time = 0;
        char current = 'a';

        for (char target : word) {
            int diff = abs(target - current);    // clockwise distance
            int move = min(diff, 26 - diff);     // shortest distance
            time += move + 1;                    // move + type
            current = target;                    // update pointer
        }
        return time;
    }
};
```

> **Why this is optimal**  
> Each character is processed once ‚Üí **O(n)** time, **O(1)** auxiliary space.  
> The algorithm uses the property that the alphabet is circular, so the distance between two letters is the minimum of the clockwise and counter‚Äëclockwise steps.

### üéØ Problem Recap

> **LeetCode 1974 ‚Äì Minimum Time to Type Word Using Special Typewriter**  
> *You‚Äôre given a circular typewriter with the 26 lowercase letters (`a`‚Äì`z`).  
> Initially the pointer points to `a`. In one second you can:*
> 1. *Move the pointer one position clockwise or counter‚Äëclockwise.*
> 2. *Type the letter the pointer currently points to.*  
> *Given a word, compute the minimum total seconds needed to type it.*

### üîç Quick Constraints

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Length of `word` | 1 ‚Ä¶ 100 |
| Alphabet | Only lowercase English letters |

---

## üß† The Good ‚Äì Why This Problem is Great for Interviews

1. **Simplicity + Depth**  
   - At first glance it looks like a trivial ‚Äúdistance‚Äù problem, but hidden inside are lessons about circular data structures, greedy choices, and optimal substructure.  

2. **Real‚ÄëWorld Parallel**  
   - Think of a mechanical typewriter or a rotating dial on a safe. Understanding shortest movement in a circular layout is common in robotics, UI/UX (circular dials), and embedded systems.

3. **Clear Optimal Substructure**  
   - For each new character we only need the previous pointer position to decide the best move. No state explosion ‚Üí *dynamic programming* isn‚Äôt required; a *greedy* approach works perfectly.

4. **Low Runtime**  
   - `O(n)` time with constant memory: a must‚Äëknow pattern for coding interviews where time constraints are tight.

5. **Easy to Extend**  
   - Once you master this, you can handle variations: different alphabets, weighted moves, or even non‚Äëlinear layouts.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Bad ‚Äì Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | What It Looks Like | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------------|--------------|
| **Forgetting the ‚Äú+1‚Äù for typing** | Adding only movement time | You‚Äôll underestimate total seconds by `word.length()` |
| **Miscomputing distances** | Using `abs(cur - prev)` only | Ignores the circular wrap‚Äëaround; e.g., `a` to `z` should be 1, not 25 |
| **Hard‚Äëcoding 26** | Writing `26` everywhere without comments | Works for lowercase English only; fails on Unicode or other alphabets |
| **Using `Math.abs` with characters in Java** | `Math.abs('z' - 'a')` yields 25 | Correct, but many new coders forget to use `abs` on `int` differences |
| **Iterating with indices and calling `charAt` in Java** | `word.charAt(i)` inside the loop | Still fine, but using an enhanced for‚Äëloop (`for (char ch : word.toCharArray())`) is cleaner and avoids off‚Äëby‚Äëone errors |
| **Not resetting pointer** | Reusing the last character incorrectly | The pointer must update after each character is typed |

---

## üëπ The Ugly ‚Äì Edge Cases You Should Test

| Test | Expected Output | Why It‚Äôs Tricky |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| `word = "a"` | `1` | Only one type action; no movement. |
| `word = "z"` | `2` | Move counter‚Äëclockwise 1 step + type. |
| `word = "az"` | `3` | Move 1 step (counter‚Äëclockwise) + type, then type `z`. |
| `word = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"` | `51` | 25 moves + 26 types (each move minimal). |
| `word = "zzzz"` | `7` | No movement after first `z`; each subsequent `z` costs only 1 second. |
| `word = "qwerty"` | `27` | Mixed moves; ensures algorithm chooses the correct direction each time. |
| `word = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza"` | `27` | Circular wrap from `z` back to `a` costs 1, not 25. |

> **Tip:** Write a quick script to brute‚Äëforce all words of length 1‚Äì3 and compare against your implementation. It guarantees that the distance logic is bug‚Äëfree.

## üìö Step‚Äëby‚ÄëStep Solution Walkthrough

### 1. Initialize

```text
pointer = 'a'          // starting position
time = 0
```

### 2. For each character `c` in `word`

1. **Compute absolute distance**  
   ```diff
   diff = |c - pointer|
   ```
2. **Wrap‚Äëaround distance**  
   ```diff
   wrap = 26 - diff
   ```
3. **Choose the shortest move**  
   ```diff
   move = min(diff, wrap)
   ```
4. **Add time**  
   ```diff
   time += move + 1     // +1 for typing the character
   ```
5. **Update pointer**  
   ```diff
   pointer = c
   ```

### 3. Return `time`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Complexity Analysis

| Measure | Result |
|---------|--------|
| **Time** | `O(n)` where `n = word.length()` (single pass) |
| **Space** | `O(1)` ‚Äì only a few integer/char variables |

---

## üìà Variations You Might Encounter

| Variation | How to Adjust |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Different alphabet size** | Replace `26` with `alphabetSize`. |
| **Weighted moves** | Pre‚Äëcompute a 26√ó26 cost matrix; use `move = min(diff, wrap, weightedCost)`. |
| **Non‚Äëcircular layout** | Use a linear distance (`diff`) only. |
| **Fastest ‚Äútype‚Äù action only** | Remove the `+1` and report just movement. |

## üöÄ Final Takeaway

> **LeetCode‚ÄØ1974** is a textbook example of how a seemingly simple puzzle hides a neat greedy pattern, reinforces the importance of handling circular structures, and prepares you for real‚Äëworld interview questions that demand both correctness and efficiency.
