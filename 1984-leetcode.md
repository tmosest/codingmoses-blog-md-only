        ## 1. ‚ÄØSolution Code  

Below are three clean, production‚Äëready implementations of the ‚ÄúMinimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores‚Äù problem (LeetCode‚ÄØ1984).  
All three use the same optimal strategy ‚Äì **sort the array and slide a window of size‚ÄØk** ‚Äì but are written in Java, Python, and C++.

### 1.1 Java 17

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    /**
     * Returns the minimal possible difference between the highest
     * and lowest scores of any k chosen students.
     *
     * @param nums array of student scores
     * @param k    number of students to pick
     * @return minimal difference
     */
    public int minimumDifference(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (k == 1) return 0;          // trivial case
        Arrays.sort(nums);             // O(n log n)

        int best = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i <= nums.length - k; i++) {
            int diff = nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i];
            if (diff < best) best = diff;
        }
        return best;                   // O(n)
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution s = new Solution();
        System.out.println(s.minimumDifference(new int[]{9,4,1,7}, 2)); // 2
    }
}
```

---

### 1.2 Python‚ÄØ3

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumDifference(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        """Return minimal difference between max and min of any k scores."""
        if k == 1:
            return 0

        nums.sort()                     # O(n log n)
        best = float('inf')
        for i in range(len(nums) - k + 1):
            diff = nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i]
            best = min(best, diff)
        return best                     # O(n)

# Demo
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    print(sol.minimumDifference([9,4,1,7], 2))   # 2
```

---

### 1.3 C++17

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDifference(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        if (k == 1) return 0;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());          // O(n log n)

        int best = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i <= nums.size() - k; ++i) {
            int diff = nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i];
            best = min(best, diff);
        }
        return best;                             // O(n)
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution s;
    vector<int> v = {9,4,1,7};
    cout << s.minimumDifference(v, 2) << '\n';   // 2
    return 0;
}
```

### 2.2 Introduction

When interviewing for software engineering roles, interviewers love problems that test a candidate‚Äôs ability to reason about data structures and algorithmic complexity.  
LeetCode‚ÄØ1984 ‚Äì *Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores* ‚Äì is one such ‚Äúeasy‚Äù problem that nevertheless showcases clarity, efficiency, and code quality.

In this article we‚Äôll:

1. **Explain the problem statement** in plain English.
2. Discuss the **constraints** that shape our approach.
3. Walk through the **optimal solution** ‚Äì sorting + sliding window ‚Äì and why it wins.
4. Show three **complete, idiomatic implementations**: Java, Python, C++.
5. Highlight the **good, the bad, and the ugly** of common pitfalls.
6. Provide **SEO tags** so recruiters searching for this problem can find this guide.

### 2.3 Problem Restatement

> **Input**: An integer array `nums` (`1 ‚â§ nums.length ‚â§ 1000`, each element `0 ‚Ä¶ 10‚Åµ`) and an integer `k` (`1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ nums.length`).  
> **Task**: Pick any `k` scores from `nums`. Among those `k` scores, compute the difference between the highest and lowest. Return the *minimum possible* difference achievable by any choice of `k` scores.

> **Examples**  
> * `nums = [90]`, `k = 1` ‚Üí answer `0`.  
> * `nums = [9,4,1,7]`, `k = 2` ‚Üí answer `2` (pick `7` and `9`).

### 2.4 Why the Straight‚ÄëForward Brute Force Fails

A na√Øve solution would enumerate every combination of `k` elements (`O(n choose k)`), compute the max/min for each, and track the best difference.  
For `n = 1000` and even moderate `k`, the number of combinations explodes combinatorially ‚Äì clearly impractical for interview or production code.

Hence we need a **polynomial‚Äëtime** algorithm.

---

### 2.5 The Optimal Strategy ‚Äì Sorting + Sliding Window

#### 2.5.1 Intuition

If the array is sorted, any group of `k` consecutive elements will have a **minimal spread** among that subset: the first element is the smallest, the last is the largest.  
Conversely, any group of `k` elements that is **not consecutive** can be ‚Äútightened‚Äù by swapping out an extreme element for a closer one, thus never increasing the spread.

So:

1. **Sort** `nums` ‚Äì `O(n log n)`.
2. Slide a window of size `k` over the sorted array ‚Äì `O(n)`.  
   For each window `i‚Ä¶i+k-1`, the difference is `nums[i+k-1] - nums[i]`.
3. Keep the minimal difference encountered.

This gives an overall **time complexity of `O(n log n)`** and **`O(1)` auxiliary space** (ignoring sorting library overhead).

#### 2.5.2 Edge Cases

| Case | Reason | Handling |
|------|--------|----------|
| `k == 1` | Any single element gives diff‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0 | Return 0 immediately |
| `k == nums.length` | Must take all elements | Diff = max(nums) ‚Äì min(nums) |
| Duplicate scores | Sorting keeps them together; window handles duplicates automatically | No special treatment needed |

---

### 2.6 Full Implementation Walk‚Äëthrough

#### 2.6.1 Java

*Uses `Arrays.sort()` for in‚Äëplace sorting and a simple `for` loop for the sliding window.*

```java
int minimumDifference(int[] nums, int k) {
    if (k == 1) return 0;
    Arrays.sort(nums);
    int best = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    for (int i = 0; i <= nums.length - k; i++) {
        best = Math.min(best, nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i]);
    }
    return best;
}
```

#### 2.6.2 Python

*Leverages list sort and a `for` range loop.*

```python
def minimumDifference(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    if k == 1:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    best = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(nums) - k + 1):
        best = min(best, nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i])
    return best
```

#### 2.6.3 C++

*Uses `std::sort` and a classic `for` loop.*

```cpp
int minimumDifference(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    if (k == 1) return 0;
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int best = INT_MAX;
    for (size_t i = 0; i + k <= nums.size(); ++i) {
        best = min(best, nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i]);
    }
    return best;
}
```

All three implementations run in `O(n log n)` time and `O(1)` extra space.

### 2.7 Good, Bad, Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Time Complexity** | Sorting + window = `O(n log n)` (optimal) | Brute‚Äëforce `O(n choose k)` ‚Äì impractical | None ‚Äì algorithm is simple |
| **Readability** | Clear separation: sort ‚Üí window ‚Üí min | Too many nested loops or unnecessary variables | Magic numbers or hard‚Äëcoded indices |
| **Edge Handling** | Explicit `k==1` guard, window bounds safe | Forgetting `k==nums.length` case, off‚Äëby‚Äëone errors | Over‚Äëoptimizing with additional data structures that add overhead |
| **Space** | In‚Äëplace sort, `O(1)` auxiliary | Building all combinations ‚Üí `O(nCk)` memory | None |
| **Maintainability** | Comments, consistent style | Mixed naming conventions | Over‚Äëcommented or redundant notes |

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Off‚Äëby‚Äëone** in the sliding window loop (`i <= nums.length - k`).
- **Integer overflow**: Use `int` for scores up to `10^5` but keep in mind `nums[i+k-1] - nums[i]` still fits in `int`.
- **Ignoring trivial cases**: `k==1` always yields `0`; early return saves time.
