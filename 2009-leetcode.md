## 1. Introduction

In software‑engineering interviews recruiters love to test two things at once:

1. **Your problem‑solving chops** – can you turn a “puzzling” statement into a clean, optimal algorithm?  
2. **Your engineering mindset** – do you write code that’s readable, maintainable and ready for production?

LeetCode’s *“Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Continuous”* is a perfect blend of both. It requires a **two‑pointer (sliding window)** solution after a single sort and deduplication.  

Below you’ll find:

* The full problem statement  
* A step‑by‑step intuition that turns the “hard” into a *“one‑pointer”* trick  
* Three production‑ready implementations (Java, Python, C++)  
* Edge‑case analysis, testing tips and a final “why this matters in a real interview” note

## 2. Problem Statement

> **Given an integer array `nums` (length `n`), you can replace any element with any integer you like.**  
> After a series of replacements, the array must satisfy **both** conditions:  
> 1. All elements are **unique**.  
> 2. The maximum element is at most `nums[0] + n - 1` and the minimum element is at least `nums[0]`.  
>  
> In other words, the final array must form a **continuous block** of `n` consecutive integers (e.g., `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` for `n = 5`).  
>  
> **Return the minimum number of replacements needed**.

**Constraints**

| | |
|---|---|
| 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 2 × 10⁴ | 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁹ |
| The array may contain duplicates. |

## 3. Intuition – “What If We Keep the Smallest Numbers?”

The key observation is that **the element we decide to keep as the *leftmost* value of the final consecutive block determines the entire range**.

If we keep `x` as the first element of the block, the block must look like:

```
[x, x+1, x+2, …, x+n-1]
```

Any element larger than `x+n-1` cannot belong to the block; we must replace it.  
Consequently, for a fixed `x` the number of replacements equals

```
n - (count of numbers ≤ x+n-1)
```

But we still don’t know which value of `x` will minimize this.  
We must examine **every distinct value** in the array as a candidate starting point.  
That’s why we sort and deduplicate the array first.

---

## 4. The Sliding‑Window (Two‑Pointers) Solution

After we have a sorted list of **unique** values, the task turns into a classic “count how many values lie in a moving interval” problem.

### 4.1  Algorithm Steps

1. **Sort & Deduplicate**  
   * `unique = sorted(set(nums))` – this gives us a strictly increasing list of all different numbers.

2. **Two‑Pointer Scan**  
   * Let `n` be the original array length.  
   * `left` iterates over every position in `unique`.  
   * `right` expands as far as possible while  
     `unique[right] < unique[left] + n` (the inclusive upper bound of the interval).  
   * The window `[left, right)` contains all values that could stay unchanged when we start the block at `unique[left]`.  
   * The number of replacements for this starting point is  
     `n - (right - left)`.

3. **Keep the Minimum**  
   * Track the smallest replacement count across all `left`.

Because `right` never moves backwards, the overall time is **O(n log n)** (dominated by the sort) and the two‑pointer loop is **O(n)**.

### 4.2  Why This Works

* **Uniqueness is enforced** – duplicates would violate the “all elements unique” rule.  
  By deduplicating we guarantee that the window only contains valid candidates.  
* **Monotonicity of the sorted array** – when `left` moves to the next larger value, the previous `right` can only stay the same or move forward.  
  We never need to reset `right`, so the inner while‑loop never runs **n²** times.

### 4.3  Edge Cases

| Edge case | Explanation | How the algorithm handles it |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------------|
| All elements identical | Only one unique number → the block length must be `n`. | `unique.length = 1`; window size = 1 → replacements = `n-1`. |
| Already continuous | The smallest element `min` satisfies `min + n - 1` ≥ largest element. | `right` will reach end of `unique`; window size = `unique.length`; replacements = `n - unique.length` (which is 0). |
| Large gaps | Example `[1, 10, 11, 12]` – starting at `1` gives many replacements, starting at `10` gives few. | Every start is evaluated, so we get the global optimum. |
| Negative numbers | Constraints say 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁹, but the algorithm would still work. | No special handling needed. |

## 5. Implementations

Below are **production‑ready** implementations in Java, Python and C++.  
All three follow the same logic and respect the time/memory limits LeetCode imposes.

### 5.1  Java (Java 17)

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        // 1. Build a sorted set of unique values
        TreeSet<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();
        for (int v : nums) set.add(v);

        // 2. Convert to an array for O(1) index access
        int m = set.size();
        int[] uniq = new int[m];
        int idx = 0;
        for (int val : set) uniq[idx++] = val;

        // 3. Two‑pointer sliding window
        int left = 0, right = 0, ans = n;
        while (left < m) {
            // Expand right while it stays inside the current interval
            while (right < m && uniq[right] < uniq[left] + n) {
                right++;
            }
            // right - left = number of elements that stay unchanged
            ans = Math.min(ans, n - (right - left));
            left++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

*Why use `TreeSet`?*  
It automatically deduplicates and sorts in O(n log n).  
The subsequent array copy gives constant‑time random access required by the two pointers.

---

### 5.2  Python (Python 3)

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        # 1. Sorted unique values
        uniq = sorted(set(nums))
        m = len(uniq)

        ans = n
        right = 0
        for left in range(m):
            # 2. Expand right while in the allowed range
            while right < m and uniq[right] < uniq[left] + n:
                right += 1
            # 3. Update answer
            ans = min(ans, n - (right - left))
        return ans
```

---

### 5.3  C++ (C++17)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();

        // 1. Build sorted unique vector
        set<int> s(nums.begin(), nums.end());   // removes duplicates and sorts
        vector<int> uniq(s.begin(), s.end());
        int m = uniq.size();

        int ans = n;
        int right = 0;
        for (int left = 0; left < m; ++left) {
            while (right < m && uniq[right] < uniq[left] + n) ++right;
            ans = min(ans, n - (right - left));
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

*Why a `set`?*  
`std::set` guarantees both uniqueness and sorting in one go.  
The subsequent `vector` gives the O(1) indexing needed for the sliding window.

## 6. Testing & Sample Runs

| Input | Output | Explanation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `[5,6,8,4,1,4,7,5,2,4]` | `2` | After sorting we get `[1,2,4,5,6,7,8]`. The smallest value that can keep a block of size 10 is `1`. The largest element is `8`, so we replace the 4 duplicates (`4` appears 3 times) and one element that is too large (`8` is fine). |
| `[1, 2, 3]` | `0` | Already continuous. |
| `[1, 10, 11, 12]` | `2` | Start at `10`: keep `10,11,12`, replace the two missing values (`2,3`). |

Run them on LeetCode to see the runtime numbers above – they all stay well below the limits.

## 7. Why Recruiters Care About This Problem

| Interview aspect | How the solution showcases it |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Complexity analysis** | Demonstrating the **O(n log n)** bottleneck (sort) and an **O(n)** scan shows you understand how to separate concerns. |
| **Handling invalid inputs** | The code **deduplicates** at the outset, guaranteeing compliance with the “unique” rule – a real‑world requirement. |
| **Readable code** | Each implementation contains clear variable names (`left`, `right`, `uniq`, `ans`) and small, self‑contained blocks. |
| **Language‑agnostic insight** | Recruiters can easily map the Java logic to other languages you may use at work. |

> 👉 **Pro Tip** – During interviews, mention that you **avoid hidden pitfalls** (duplicates, unnecessary scans) by sorting once and then using a sliding window.  
> That tells the interviewer you’re thinking about **runtime and maintenance** from the start.
