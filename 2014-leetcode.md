        ## 1. The Code – Three Implementations  
Below are clean, beginner‑friendly solutions in **Java**, **Python** and **C++** that solve the LeetCode Hard problem **“Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times”**.

> **Why this solution?**  
> 1. It uses only O(26ⁿ/k) states – far below the 2000‑character limit.  
> 2. A depth‑first search (DFS) guarantees that the first found subsequence of a given length is the **lexicographically largest** one, so we don’t need to keep a full queue or sort anything.  
> 3. The helper `isK` is a simple two‑pointer scan that runs in O(n) time.

> **Tip for Interviewers**  
> In all three codes the **complexity is O(26ⁿ/k · n)**.  
> Because `n/k` is at most 2000/1 = 2000, the exponential factor is small – the code runs comfortably within 1‑second limits on LeetCode.

## 2. The Blog – “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of the Longest Subsequence Repeated *k* Times”

> *Keywords: “Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times”, “LeetCode Hard”, “string subsequence”, “DFS solution”, “Java Python C++”, “coding interview”, “algorithm design”, “lexicographically largest”.*  

### 2.1  The Problem (in a nutshell)

> **Given** a string `s` (≤ 2000 characters) and an integer `k` (≤ 2000), find the longest string `sub` such that `sub` repeated `k` times is still a subsequence of `s`.  
> If several such `sub` exist, return the **lexicographically largest** one.  
> If none exist, return the empty string.

> **Why is it Hard?**  
> *The twist* – you’re not just checking a single subsequence, you’re checking *k copies* of it, which feels like a 2‑D problem (string × repetition).  
> *The constraints* force you to think about pruning and ordering: you can’t afford to generate all 26ⁿ sequences naively.

---

### 2.2  The Good –  A Clean, Backtracking Approach

1. **Upper bound on length** – Because we need `k` copies, the subsequence can’t be longer than `|s| / k`.  
2. **DFS + early pruning** – We only continue building a prefix if it *still* satisfies `isK`. This drastically cuts the search space.  
3. **Lexicographic ordering** – By trying characters from `'z'` down to `'a'`, the *first* valid sequence we find for a given length is the **lexicographically largest**. No need for extra data structures or sorting.  

> **Complexity**  
> *Time:* O(26ⁿ/k · n) – in practice far below the 2000‑character limit.  
> *Space:* O(n) for the recursion stack and O(1) extra memory besides the answer string.

> **What to tell the interviewer**  
> *Explain the length bound (`n / k`) immediately.*  
> *Show that `isK` is just a linear scan; talk about the two‑pointer logic.*  
> *Mention that we’re doing DFS “length‑by‑length” so we never waste time exploring longer sequences than necessary.*

---

### 2.3  The Bad –  Why a Breadth‑First Search Can Fail

A classic mistake is to push every 1‑character string into a queue and then grow them level by level (BFS).  
*Why it fails:*  
* BFS explores **shorter** strings first, so you might finish exploring all length‑1 candidates before even touching length‑2.  
* Even if you keep a “best” string, you still need to keep a queue that can grow to 26ⁿ/k elements – with 2000 characters, that’s still fine, but the code gets messier and the performance drops dramatically on larger test cases.

> **What to avoid**  
> *Do not store all prefixes in a queue.*  
> *Do not sort or compare strings after the fact.*  
> *Do not rely on the queue ordering to guarantee lexicographic optimality.*  

---

### 2.4  The Ugly –  Subtle Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Explanation | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Empty subsequence (`""`) is always valid** | Some people write `isK("")` as false, causing an early return of an empty string. | Return `true` for the empty string before any other logic. |
| **Off‑by‑one in repetition count** | Counting copies of `sub` inside `isK` can accidentally stop after one less than `k`. | Reset the index (`idx = 0`) *after* counting a copy. |
| **Wrong target length** | Using `ceil(n / k)` allows a subsequence that is too long. | Use `max_len = n // k` (floor division). |
| **Wrong character order** | Processing `'a'` to `'z'` and taking the *last* good string works, but is error‑prone. | Iterate from `'z'` down to `'a'` and return immediately when a valid string is found. |
| **Recursive depth limit** | Forgetting to stop after reaching the longest possible length leads to needless recursion. | In the outer loop, try lengths from `max_len` down to `1` and stop when a valid one is found. |

---

### 2.5  Interview‑Ready Summary

1. **Start with the length bound**: `max_len = |s| // k`.  
2. **DFS from `max_len` down to 1** – this guarantees you’ll get the longest first.  
3. **For each depth**:  
   * Try characters `'z'` → `'a'`.  
   * Keep the prefix only if `isK` still holds.  
   * Recursively go deeper until the target length is reached.  
4. **Return the first found string** (lexicographically largest of that length).  
5. **If no string of length ≥ 1 works**: return the empty string.

### 3.1  Introduction

In many coding interviews you’ll encounter questions about **string subsequences**. A particularly tricky one is LeetCode Hard **“Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times”**.  
The challenge is to find the longest string `sub` such that `sub` repeated `k` times is still a subsequence of a given string `s`.  
If several subsequences satisfy the condition, we must return the **lexicographically largest** one.

This post walks through:

1.  The problem statement and constraints  
2.  The core algorithm (DFS + pruning)  
3.  A clear implementation in Java, Python, and C++  
4.  Common pitfalls (the “ugly” part)  
5.  Why this solution is perfect for interview prep and landing a coding‑engineer role  

Let’s dive in.

---

### 3.2  Problem Recap & Constraints

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Problem** | Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times (LeetCode Hard) |
| **Input** | String `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 2000), integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 2000) |
| **Constraint** | |s| < min(2001, k × 8) – in practice, |s| ≤ 2000 |
| **Goal** | Return the longest `sub` such that `sub`×`k` is a subsequence of `s`; if tie, lexicographically largest |

The key insight: you cannot use a subsequence longer than `|s| / k`, because you need `k` copies of it to fit into `s`.

---

### 3.3  Core Algorithm – Depth‑First Search with Early Pruning

1. **Compute the upper bound**  
   `max_len = |s| // k` (integer division). Any longer string cannot have `k` copies inside `s`.  
2. **DFS over candidate lengths** – we loop over `L` from `max_len` down to 1.  
3. **Recursive construction**  
   * At depth `d`, we already have a prefix `cur` of length `d`.  
   * For each character `'z'`→`'a'`:  
     * Append it to get a new prefix `next`.  
     * Run `isK(next)` – if it still holds, we recurse; otherwise prune this branch.  
   * If depth reaches target length `L`, run `isK(cur)` one last time and return the string if it’s valid.  
4. **Stopping early** – as soon as a valid string is found for a given length, we stop the recursion and return it.  
5. **Result** – If no string of length ≥ 1 works, return the empty string.

The algorithm is **O(26ⁿ/k · n)** in time, which is efficient enough for the problem’s limits.  
Space usage is modest – only the recursion stack and the answer string.

---

### 3.4  The DFS Code (Java, Python, C++)

*(See section 2 of this post for the exact code snippets.)*  

- **Java** – Uses a lambda for `isK` and a recursive function.  
- **Python** – A simple function that captures `isK` as a closure.  
- **C++** – Employs `std::function` and a lambda; code compiles with GNU C++17.  

All three implementations share the same logic; they are interchangeable depending on your language of choice.

---

### 3.5  Common Pitfalls (The Ugly)

1. **Empty string** – Forgetting that `""` is always a valid subsequence can lead to wrong answers.  
2. **Repetition counting** – Off‑by‑one errors when counting copies of `sub` inside `isK`.  
3. **Length bound** – Using `ceil` instead of `floor` lets you try impossible lengths.  
4. **Character order** – Choosing the wrong iteration order (`'a'`→`'z'`) makes lexicographic optimality fragile.  
5. **DFS depth** – Not terminating after reaching `max_len` results in wasted recursion.  

The “ugly” part is simply a collection of tiny errors that can trip up even seasoned programmers. Being aware of them and planning your solution accordingly is a hallmark of a top‑tier interview candidate.

---

### 3.6  Why This Works in Interviews

1. **Immediate intuition** – The `|s| / k` bound is a natural first step to explain to an interviewer.  
2. **Linear time subroutine** – `isK` is a single pass scan; you can write the two‑pointer logic on the whiteboard quickly.  
3. **Pruning** – You only keep a prefix if it still satisfies `isK`. That shows you’re thinking about *state* and *pruning* – a skill interviewers love to see.  
4. **Lexicographic guarantee** – By trying `'z'` first, you automatically satisfy the “lexicographically largest” requirement without extra work.  
5. **Language agnostic** – The same algorithm works in Java, Python, and C++. That flexibility demonstrates deep understanding rather than surface‑level coding.

Landing a coding‑engineer role demands not only the correct answer but also a clear design rationale. Showing you can reason about constraints, pick the right algorithm, and code it cleanly in any language will set you apart.

### 3.7  Take‑away Checklist

- ☐ Compute `max_len = |s| // k`.  
- ☐ DFS over lengths from `max_len` to `1`.  
- ☐ Iterate characters `'z'`→`'a'`.  
- ☐ Keep prefix only if `isK` still holds.  
- ☐ Return the first found string; if none, return `""`.  
- ☐ Test `isK("")` = `true`.  
- ☐ Reset index after counting a copy.  

Follow this checklist, and you’ll master the Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times problem in any interview.
