        ## üöÄ ‚ÄúAverage Height of Buildings in Each Segment‚Äù ‚Äì The Complete Guide  
*(Java‚ÄØ/‚ÄØPython‚ÄØ/‚ÄØC++ implementations + a SEO‚Äëfriendly blog post)*

### TL;DR  

| Language | Complexity | Key Idea |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Java** | O(n‚ÄØlog‚ÄØn) time, O(n) space | Sweep‚Äëline + `TreeMap` |
| **Python** | O(n‚ÄØlog‚ÄØn) time, O(n) space | Sweep‚Äëline + sorted list |
| **C++** | O(n‚ÄØlog‚ÄØn) time, O(n) space | Sweep‚Äëline + vector + sort |

We sweep the street from left to right, maintain the total height *sum* and the number of active buildings *cnt*.  
At every event point (a building start or end) we recalculate the average height.  
If the average changes we close the previous segment and start a new one.  
Segments with no buildings (average‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0) are never added.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Recap  

A street is a number line.  
`buildings[i] = [start_i, end_i, height_i]` ‚Äì a building occupies `[start_i, end_i)` and has height `height_i`.  

**Goal**  
Return the list of non‚Äëoverlapping half‚Äëclosed segments `[left, right)` together with the integer average height of all buildings covering that segment.  
The average is `sum(heights) // count` (integer division).  
Segments with average‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0 (no building) must be omitted.  
Segments with the same average and touching each other must be merged.

The input size is up to 10‚Åµ buildings, coordinates up to 10‚Å∏, heights up to 10‚Åµ.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Core Idea ‚Äì Sweep Line  

1. **Events** ‚Äì For every building create two events:  
   * `(start, +height, +1)` ‚Äì a building starts.  
   * `(end,   -height, -1)` ‚Äì a building ends.

2. **Sort** the events by their coordinate.  
   If several events share the same coordinate, process them *together* ‚Äì otherwise we would split a segment that should stay continuous.

3. **Maintain state** while scanning the sorted events:  

   * `sum` ‚Äì total height of all active buildings (needs 64‚Äëbit).  
   * `cnt` ‚Äì number of active buildings.  
   * `prevCoord` ‚Äì start of the current segment.  
   * `prevAvg` ‚Äì average height of the current segment.

4. **On each coordinate**  
   * Update `sum` and `cnt` with *all* events at this coordinate.  
   * Compute `newAvg = cnt > 0 ? sum / cnt : 0`.  
   * If `newAvg != prevAvg` **and** `prevAvg > 0` ‚Üí add `[prevCoord, coord, prevAvg]` to the answer.  
   * Set `prevCoord = coord` and `prevAvg = newAvg`.

5. **Finish** ‚Äì The loop automatically closes every segment; we never need a special post‚Äëprocessing step.

Why does this merge adjacent equal‚Äëaverage segments?  
Because we only create a new segment when the average actually changes.  
If the average stays the same across an event point (e.g. a building ends but another with the same height starts), `prevAvg == newAvg` ‚Üí no segment split.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Edge‚ÄëCases & Pitfalls  

| Pitfall | What went wrong | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Multiple events at the same coordinate** | Splitting segments unnecessarily | Group events by coordinate before updating state |
| **Division by zero** | `cnt == 0` when no building | Guard: `cnt > 0 ? sum / cnt : 0` |
| **Large sums** | 10‚Åµ buildings √ó 10‚Åµ height = 10¬π‚Å∞ ‚Üí overflow 32‚Äëbit | Use 64‚Äëbit (`long` / `int64_t`) for `sum` |
| **Empty street** | All segments average‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0 ‚Üí output empty | Skip segments when `prevAvg == 0` |
| **Merging requirement** | Adjacent equal‚Äëaverage segments not merged | Only split on average change |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Full Code ‚Äì Java  

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[][] averageHeightOfBuildings(int[][] buildings) {
        // Event: [coordinate, deltaHeight, deltaCount]
        List<int[]> events = new ArrayList<>(buildings.length * 2);
        for (int[] b : buildings) {
            events.add(new int[]{b[0],  b[2],  1}); // start
            events.add(new int[]{b[1], -b[2], -1}); // end
        }

        // sort by coordinate
        events.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));

        long sum = 0;          // total height (64‚Äëbit)
        int cnt = 0;           // active building count
        int prev = events.get(0)[0]; // first event coordinate
        int prevAvg = 0;       // previous average
        List<int[]> ans = new ArrayList<>();

        int i = 0;
        while (i < events.size()) {
            int coord = events.get(i)[0];

            // ---- process all events at this coordinate ----
            while (i < events.size() && events.get(i)[0] == coord) {
                sum += events.get(i)[1];
                cnt += events.get(i)[2];
                i++;
            }

            int newAvg = cnt > 0 ? (int)(sum / cnt) : 0;

            // ---- close previous segment if average changed ----
            if (newAvg != prevAvg && prevAvg > 0) {
                ans.add(new int[]{prev, coord, prevAvg});
            }

            // ---- start new segment ----
            prev = coord;
            prevAvg = newAvg;
        }

        // ---- convert list to array ----
        int[][] res = new int[ans.size()][];
        for (int j = 0; j < ans.size(); j++) {
            res[j] = ans.get(j);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Why it‚Äôs fast**  
*Sorting* takes `O(n log n)`; the scan itself is linear.  
Memory: one event per building ‚Üí `O(n)`.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Bonus ‚Äì Why this is the ‚ÄúSweep‚ÄëLine‚Äù variant of the Skyline problem  

| Problem | Similarities | Differences |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Skyline** | We also sweep and maintain active heights | Skyline keeps the *maximum* height; here we keep **average** (sum / count) |
| **Average Height** | Uses the same event‚Äëbased update | We need a 64‚Äëbit sum and integer division |
| **Merging** | Skyline never merges equal heights across an event | Our algorithm skips segment creation when the average stays the same |

### üöÄ ‚ÄúAverage Height of Buildings in Each Segment‚Äù ‚Äì What Every Software Engineer Should Know  

The LeetCode ‚ÄúAverage Height of Buildings in Each Segment‚Äù problem is a perfect showcase of:

- **Algorithmic elegance**: A one‚Äëpass sweep line beats brute‚Äëforce by a factor of 10‚Åµ.  
- **Data‚Äëstructure mastery**: Managing event updates with a `TreeMap` (Java) or sorted list (Python/C++) demonstrates knowledge of balanced trees / heaps.  
- **Problem‚Äësolving mindset**: Recognizing the connection to the classic Skyline problem and re‚Äëusing the sweep line pattern is exactly the kind of insight interviewers look for.  

Below, we‚Äôll walk through the reasoning, pitfalls, and solutions in three languages. Grab a coffee, dive in, and feel free to copy‚Äëpaste into your local IDE or GitHub repository.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement (Paraphrased)

> A street is a number line.  
> `buildings[i] = [start_i, end_i, height_i]` ‚Äì the building occupies `[start_i, end_i)` with height `height_i`.  
> Return a list of non‚Äëoverlapping half‚Äëclosed segments `[left, right)` with the **integer** average height of all buildings covering that segment.  
> Segments where the average is zero (no building) must be omitted, and touching segments with the same average must be merged.

*Why it matters:*  
- **Coordinate range**: up to 10‚Å∏, so we can‚Äôt discretise the entire street.  
- **Input size**: 10‚Åµ buildings ‚Üí O(n¬≤) brute force is impossible.  
- **Interview relevance**: This is a classic ‚Äúsweep‚Äëline‚Äù problem that appears in many coding interviews and is a common LeetCode Medium question.

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Sweep‚ÄëLine Strategy  

1. **Build Events**  
   For every building create two events:  
   ```text
   (start, +height, +1)   # building enters
   (end,   -height, -1)   # building exits
   ```

2. **Sort by Coordinate**  
   All events sorted left‚Äëto‚Äëright.  
   If multiple events share the same coordinate we process them **together** to avoid artificial segment splits.

3. **Maintain State**  
   ```text
   sum  ‚Äì total height of all active buildings   (64‚Äëbit)
   cnt  ‚Äì number of active buildings
   prevCoord ‚Äì start of the current segment
   prevAvg   ‚Äì current average height
   ```

4. **Iterate**  
   * For each coordinate `x`:  
     - Update `sum` and `cnt` with **all** events at `x`.  
     - Compute `newAvg = sum // cnt` if `cnt > 0`, else `0`.  
     - If `newAvg != prevAvg` **and** `prevAvg > 0`, push `[prevCoord, x, prevAvg]` to answer list.  
     - Set `prevCoord = x` and `prevAvg = newAvg`.

5. **Finish**  
   Convert the answer list to an array/`vector`.

*Complexity:*  
- **Time**: `O(n log n)` due to sorting; the scan is linear.  
- **Space**: `O(n)` ‚Äì one event per building.  
- **Overflow safety**: Use 64‚Äëbit for `sum`; Python‚Äôs integers are unbounded, C++/Java need `long long`/`long`.

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Common Pitfalls & How We Avoided Them  

| Pitfall | What Happens | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Integer overflow** | `sum` exceeds 32‚Äëbit | Use 64‚Äëbit (`long` / `long long`). |
| **Division by zero** | No active buildings ‚Üí `cnt == 0` | Guard `cnt > 0` before dividing. |
| **Unnecessary segments** | Average stays the same across an event but we still create a segment | Only push a segment if `newAvg != prevAvg` **and** `prevAvg > 0`. |
| **Wrong merge logic** | Segments with zero average should not be output at all | Check `prevAvg > 0` before pushing. |

---

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Three Language‚ÄëSpecific Implementations  

##### Java (using `ArrayList` + event scan)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] averageHeightOfBuildings(int[][] buildings) {
        List<int[]> events = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] b : buildings) {
            events.add(new int[]{b[0],  b[2], 1});
            events.add(new int[]{b[1], -b[2], -1});
        }
        events.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));

        long sum = 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        int prev = events.get(0)[0];
        int prevAvg = 0;
        List<int[]> ans = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < events.size(); ) {
            int x = events.get(i)[0];
            while (i < events.size() && events.get(i)[0] == x) {
                sum += events.get(i)[1];
                cnt += events.get(i)[2];
                i++;
            }
            int newAvg = cnt > 0 ? (int)(sum / cnt) : 0;
            if (newAvg != prevAvg && prevAvg > 0)
                ans.add(new int[]{prev, x, prevAvg});
            prev = x;
            prevAvg = newAvg;
        }

        return ans.toArray(new int[0][0]);
    }
}
```

##### Python (straight‚Äëforward list/tuple)

```python
class Solution:
    def averageHeightOfBuildings(self, buildings: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        events = []
        for s, e, h in buildings:
            events.append((s, h, 1))
            events.append((e, -h, -1))
        events.sort()
        sum_h, cnt = 0, 0
        prev, prev_avg = events[0][0], 0
        ans = []
        i = 0
        while i < len(events):
            x = events[i][0]
            while i < len(events) and events[i][0] == x:
                sum_h += events[i][1]
                cnt += events[i][2]
                i += 1
            new_avg = sum_h // cnt if cnt else 0
            if new_avg != prev_avg and prev_avg > 0:
                ans.append([prev, x, prev_avg])
            prev, prev_avg = x, new_avg
        return ans
```

##### C++17 (using `tuple` for clarity)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> averageHeightOfBuildings(vector<vector<int>>& buildings) {
        vector<tuple<int,int,int>> ev;
        for (auto &b : buildings) {
            ev.emplace_back(b[0],  b[2],  1);
            ev.emplace_back(b[1], -b[2], -1);
        }
        sort(ev.begin(), ev.end(),
            [](auto const &a, auto const &b){ return get<0>(a) < get<0>(b); });

        long long sum = 0; int cnt = 0;
        int prev = get<0>(ev[0]), prevAvg = 0;
        vector<array<int,3>> ans;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < ev.size();) {
            int x = get<0>(ev[i]);
            while (i < ev.size() && get<0>(ev[i]) == x) {
                sum += get<1>(ev[i]);
                cnt += get<2>(ev[i]);
                ++i;
            }
            int newAvg = cnt ? static_cast<int>(sum / cnt) : 0;
            if (newAvg != prevAvg && prevAvg > 0) ans.push_back({prev, x, prevAvg});
            prev = x; prevAvg = newAvg;
        }

        vector<vector<int>> res(ans.size());
        for (size_t k = 0; k < ans.size(); ++k)
            res[k] = { ans[k][0], ans[k][1], ans[k][2] };
        return res;
    }
};
```
