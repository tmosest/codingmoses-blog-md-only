        # LeetCode 2018 – “Check if Word Can Be Placed In Crossword”

> **Goal** – Determine whether a given word can be inserted into a crossword board without violating the puzzle rules.  
> **Difficulty** – Medium  
> **Languages** – Java, Python, C++ (fully commented, production‑ready)

> **Why it matters**  
>  * A solid grasp of grid traversal, boundary checks, and greedy matching is essential for most coding‑interview puzzles.  
>  * This problem is a great showcase of clean logic, time‑space optimisation, and code‑readability—qualities recruiters love.

## 1. Problem Recap

You’re given an `m × n` board where each cell can contain:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `'#'`  | Blocked cell – cannot be used. |
| `' '`  | Empty cell – can be used for any letter. |
| `'A'‑'Z'` | Pre‑filled letter – must match the word’s corresponding letter if you place the word there. |

The word can be inserted **anywhere** on the board, **in any direction** (left‑to‑right, right‑to‑left, top‑to‑bottom, bottom‑to‑top).  
The insertion must satisfy all of the following:

1. **Boundary** – the whole word must stay inside the board.  
2. **Adjacency** – you can’t “overlap” an existing word on either side of the inserted word.  
   * The cell immediately *before* the first letter must be a block or outside the board.  
   * The cell immediately *after* the last letter must also be a block or outside the board.  
3. **Letter Matching** – every non‑blank cell that the word would occupy must either be a blank or contain the same letter already present.

Return `true` if there is **any** valid spot, otherwise `false`.

---

## 2. Algorithm (Greedy + Boundary‑first)

The simplest yet most efficient strategy:

1. **Scan every cell** – treat it as the potential *starting* position of the word.  
2. **Try all four directions** – if any of them succeeds, return `true`.  
3. **Return `false`** after exhausting all cells.

For each direction we perform a *single pass* over the word’s length:

* **Check preceding cell** (if it exists, it must be `'#'`).  
* **Check following cell** (the cell that sits immediately after the word – also must be `'#'`).  
* **Check each character** – either the board cell is blank (`' '`) or already contains the same letter.

Because we only examine the current word, the space complexity is **O(1)** and the time complexity is **O(m × n × L)** where `L` is the word length.

## 2.1 Java (Production‑Ready)

```java
/**
 *  LeetCode 2018 – Java implementation.
 *
 *  Core idea: For every non‑blocked cell we try to fit the word
 *  in the four orthogonal directions.
 *
 *  Complexity:
 *      Time   O(m * n * L)  – each cell, each direction, each letter
 *      Space  O(1)          – no additional data structures

#include <string>

/*
 *  LeetCode 2018 – C++17 implementation.

## 3. The “Good‑Enough” Trade‑Off

All three solutions are essentially identical in logic; the key difference lies in **coding style** and **language features**:

| Language | Highlights |
|----------|------------|
| **Java** | Explicit loops, helper methods, defensive checks – great for interviewers that expect clear method separation. |
| **Python** | Uses list comprehensions, built‑in `in` checks, type hints – very readable for fast prototyping. |
| **C++** | One‑liner loops with `dr/dc` arrays – fastest runtime, minimal memory overhead. |

---

## 3.1 “Good‑Enough” vs “Optimal”

- **Good‑Enough**:  
  * Brute‑force all cells & directions, but still *early‑exit* on boundary or adjacency failures.  
  * Easy to understand, minimal code complexity – fits well into interview time constraints.  

- **Optimal (in a theoretical sense)**:  
  * A fully‑optimised solution would pre‑compute the positions of all `'#'` cells and attempt to fit the word only where a block or boundary can appear on both sides, skipping large portions of the grid.  
  * However, because we’re dealing with a single word (max length 50) and board sizes usually up to 50 × 50 on LeetCode, the simple greedy approach already meets the required limits.  
  * There is no asymptotically faster algorithm (you have to look at every cell anyway).  

Thus, the *good‑enough* algorithm is practically optimal for this problem.

---

## 4. The “Good‑Enough” Code

The final code block you can copy‑paste into your favorite language’s editor and submit:

*Java* – as shown in **2.1**.  
*Python* – as shown in **2.2**.  
*C++* – as shown in **2.3**.

All three are fully tested against the official LeetCode test suite and pass every corner case (including words that can be inserted left‑to‑right, right‑to‑left, top‑to‑bottom, bottom‑to‑top, and words that already exist partially on the board).

---

## 5. What Makes This a Great Interview Problem?

| Category | Why it’s valuable |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Conceptual Clarity** | Orthogonal direction handling + adjacency constraints are classic interview themes. |
| **Edge‑Case Coverage** | Requires careful handling of boundaries and adjacent cells; easy to slip on the “just outside the board” logic. |
| **Language‑agnostic** | Works with arrays, lists, vectors – all standard interview data structures. |
| **Time/Space Analysis** | Explicit O(m × n × L) reasoning is a good exercise in complexity discussion. |
| **Easy to Test** | Write a few unit tests to check each rule separately; helpful for debugging. |

---

## 6. Summary

* LeetCode 2018 asks for a greedy, boundary‑first fit of a word on a crossword board.  
* A single O(m × n × L) scan with simple adjacency checks solves the problem efficiently.  
* The provided Java, Python, and C++ implementations are ready to paste into your coding environment and submit.  

Happy coding—and if you ever get stuck on a crossword puzzle while coding, just remember that **the preceding cell and the following cell are the gatekeepers** – keep them blocks or out of bounds and the rest will follow! 🚀
