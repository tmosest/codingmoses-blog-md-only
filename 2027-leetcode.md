# Minimum Moves to Convert String – A Complete Interview Guide  
**LeetCode 2027 | Easy | 3‑4 min read**

---

## 1. Problem Recap

> **Input** – a string `s` of length `n (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000)` consisting only of the characters `'X'` and `'O'`.  
> **Move** – pick any *three consecutive* characters of `s` and change all of them to `'O'`.  
> **Goal** – return the *minimum* number of moves required so that every character in `s` becomes `'O'`.

> **Examples**  
> * `"XXX"` → `1` move  
> * `"XXOX"` → `2` moves  
> * `"OOOO"` → `0` moves

---

## 2. Why is this a “Greedy” Problem?

- A move always covers **exactly three consecutive positions**.  
- If the first character of a triplet is `'X'`, we *must* convert it – otherwise it will stay `'X'` forever.  
- Converting that `'X'` also turns the following two characters to `'O'`, regardless of their original state.  
- Therefore, when we see an `'X'`, the *optimal* strategy is to use a move that starts at that index – we can never do better.

This intuition turns into a linear‑time greedy algorithm.

---

## 3. The Greedy Algorithm (O(n) time, O(1) space)

1. Scan the string from left to right.  
2. Whenever we encounter an `'X'` at index `i`:
   * Increment the answer counter.  
   * Skip the next two indices (`i += 3`) because the whole triplet is now `'O'`.  
3. Otherwise (the character is already `'O'`), just move one step forward.  
4. Return the counter.

## 4. Code Implementations

Below are clean, idiomatic implementations in **Java, Python, and C++**. All of them run in **O(n)** time and use **O(1)** additional space.

---

### 4.1 Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumMoves(String s) {
        int moves = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == 'X') {   // we must act
                moves++;
                i += 3;                 // the whole triplet becomes 'O'
            } else {
                i++;                    // skip one 'O'
            }
        }
        return moves;
    }
}
```

---

### 4.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumMoves(self, s: str) -> int:
        moves, i = 0, 0
        n = len(s)
        while i < n:
            if s[i] == 'X':
                moves += 1
                i += 3          # all three become 'O'
            else:
                i += 1          # single 'O'
        return moves
```

---

### 4.3 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumMoves(string s) {
        int moves = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); ) {
            if (s[i] == 'X') {
                ++moves;
                i += 3;           // triplet becomes 'O'
            } else {
                ++i;              // skip the 'O'
            }
        }
        return moves;
    }
};
```

## 5. Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Java | Python | C++ |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| Time   | **O(n)** | **O(n)** | **O(n)** |
| Space  | **O(1)** | **O(1)** | **O(1)** |

`n` is the length of the input string.

---

## 6. Edge Cases & Common Pitfalls

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Forgetting to skip the next two indices after a move | `i += 3` (not `i++`) |
| Using `i < n-2` as loop condition | Works but forces an extra check; a simple `i < n` with `continue` inside is cleaner |
| Treating the operation as reversible | The operation is **not** reversible; once an `'X'` is converted to `'O'` it stays so. |
| Thinking we should *always* move the pointer by 3 even when the next two are already `'O'` | That’s fine; it still yields the optimal count because the triplet will become `'O'` regardless. |

---

## 7. The Good, The Bad, The Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Intuition** | The greedy observation is *extremely* simple once you see the triplet logic. | Some might overthink and try DP or BFS, overcomplicating the problem. | A naive solution that scans every triplet on each step leads to O(n²) time – a textbook “gotcha”. |
| **Implementation** | O(n) loop with a single counter – no extra data structures needed. | Using recursion or excessive string copying is unnecessary. | Forgetting that the operation covers *three* characters can produce wrong answers (e.g., `s[i] = 'X'` → `i += 1`). |
| **Testing** | Include strings with alternating `XO` patterns, all `'O'`, all `'X'`, and random mixes. | Edge case of length 3 or 4 – ensure correct handling of boundaries. | Very long strings (n = 1000) to validate linearity. |
| **Interview Perception** | Shows understanding of greedy strategy and reasoning. | A lack of explanation about why the algorithm is optimal may raise red flags. | Failing to discuss time/space complexity or boundary cases can hurt your score. |

### 9. Final Words

- Stick to the greedy insight: *“Whenever you see an X, act now.”*  
- Keep your loop simple, just scan once and skip three when you act.  
- Remember the pitfalls and test your solution against edge cases.  
- Explain the intuition during an interview – interviewers love seeing *why* you chose a solution, not just *how* you implemented it.

Good luck, and may your coding interviews convert more than just strings!
