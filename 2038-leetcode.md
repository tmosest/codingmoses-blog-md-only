## 1. Problem Overview<a name="problem-overview"></a>  
Given a string `colors` composed only of `'A'` and `'B'`, two players play a turn‑based game:

| Player | Move | Restrictions |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **Alice** (first) | Remove a piece of color **A** | The piece **must** have *both* neighbors of color **A** (cannot be on an edge). |
| **Bob** | Remove a piece of color **B** | The piece **must** have *both* neighbors of color **B** (cannot be on an edge). |

If a player cannot make a move on his turn, he loses.  
Return `true` if Alice wins, otherwise `false`.

*Constraints*  
- `1 ≤ colors.length ≤ 10⁵`  
- `colors[i] ∈ { 'A', 'B' }`

---

## 2. Game‑Theory Insight<a name="game-theory-insight"></a>  
At first glance the game feels like a typical impartial combinatorial game.  
However, the *only* pieces that can ever be removed are those that are **strictly inside** a block of the same color.  
Consequences:

1. **Removing one piece from a block never creates a new removable piece of the *other* color.**  
   The only thing that can happen is that the *same* block shrinks by one, possibly destroying a removable piece inside it.

2. **Both players play optimally and alternately.**  
   Therefore, the winner is decided by the *count* of possible moves each player has at the start.  
   If Alice can make more moves than Bob, she will exhaust her moves first and force Bob to have none, guaranteeing a win.  
   Conversely, if Bob’s moves are ≥ Alice’s, Bob can survive longer and win.

Thus, the problem collapses to a *simple counting* problem.

---

## 3. The “Good” –  A One‑Line Formula<a name="the-good"></a>  
For every maximal block of consecutive equal characters (e.g., `"AAA"` or `"BBBB"`), the number of removable pieces inside that block is `max(blockLength − 2, 0)`.  
Why?

- You need at least three identical pieces (`…AAA…`) for the middle one to have two identical neighbors.
- The first and last pieces of the block are on the edge of that block, so they cannot be removed.
- Removing the middle one reduces the block size by 1, potentially destroying a future move, but **this is already captured by the initial count**.

So the algorithm is:

```
countA = count of removable 'A' pieces
countB = count of removable 'B' pieces
return countA > countB
```

No simulation, no recursion, no DP – O(n) time, O(1) memory.

## 4. The “Bad” – Edge Cases & Common Pitfalls<a name="the-bad"></a>  

| Pitfall | What Happens | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Empty string** | No moves for anyone → Bob wins | Return `false` if length < 3 (no interior pieces) |
| **All same character** | Only one block → count = len−2 | Ensure `max(len−2, 0)` |
| **Alternating characters** (`"ABAB"` etc.) | No block length ≥ 3 → zero moves | Count stays 0, Alice loses (Bob wins) |
| **Leading / trailing edge pieces** | They cannot be removed even if they belong to a longer block | Our block logic automatically excludes them (block length is whole run). |
| **Long run of 3** (`"AAA"` or `"BBB"`) | Exactly one removable piece | `max(3−2,0)=1` |
| **Very long run of 100000** | Still O(n) | No problem |

---

## 5. The “Ugly” – When Greedy Fails (Why It Doesn’t Here)<a name="the-ugly"></a>  
In many turn‑based games a greedy approach (always pick the immediate best move) is *incorrect*.  
One might think that Alice could strategically remove a piece that creates a new removable piece for Bob, etc.  
But here, **any** removal only *shrinks* the block of the same color and never creates new opportunities for the opponent.  
Hence, the game is “greedy‑safe”: you simply count the available moves.  
That’s the ugly simplicity that turns a complex game into a one‑liner.

---

## 6. Solution Walk‑through<a name="solution-walk-through"></a>  

1. Iterate over the string, grouping consecutive identical characters.  
2. For each group, if the character is `'A'`, add `max(len−2, 0)` to `countA`.  
   If `'B'`, add to `countB`.  
3. After the loop, compare the two counters.  
4. Return `true` if `countA > countB`, else `false`.

---

## 7. Complexity Analysis<a name="complexity-analysis"></a>  

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Time   | `O(n)` – single pass over the string |
| Space  | `O(1)` – only a few integer counters |

Both meet LeetCode’s limits comfortably even for `n = 10⁵`.

### Java (LeetCode style)

```java
// 2038. Remove Colored Pieces if Both Neighbors are the Same Color
// Time:  O(n)   Space:  O(1)

class Solution {
    public boolean winnerOfGame(String colors) {
        int countA = 0, countB = 0;
        int i = 0, n = colors.length();

        while (i < n) {
            char cur = colors.charAt(i);
            int j = i;
            while (j < n && colors.charAt(j) == cur) j++;
            int len = j - i;
            if (cur == 'A')
                countA += Math.max(len - 2, 0);
            else
                countB += Math.max(len - 2, 0);
            i = j;
        }
        return countA > countB;
    }
}
```

### Python (LeetCode style)

```python
# 2038. Remove Colored Pieces if Both Neighbors are the Same Color
# Time: O(n)   Space: O(1)

class Solution:
    def winnerOfGame(self, colors: str) -> bool:
        count_a = count_b = 0
        i = 0
        n = len(colors)

        while i < n:
            cur = colors[i]
            j = i
            while j < n and colors[j] == cur:
                j += 1
            length = j - i
            if cur == 'A':
                count_a += max(length - 2, 0)
            else:
                count_b += max(length - 2, 0)
            i = j

        return count_a > count_b
```

> **Pythonic one‑liner (for interviews that love brevity)**

```python
from itertools import groupby
class Solution:
    def winnerOfGame(self, colors: str) -> bool:
        c = {ch: max(0, sum(1 for _ in grp) - 2)
             for ch, grp in groupby(colors)}
        return c.get('A', 0) > c.get('B', 0)
```

### C++ (LeetCode style)

```cpp
// 2038. Remove Colored Pieces if Both Neighbors are the Same Color
// Time:  O(n)   Space:  O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    bool winnerOfGame(string colors) {
        int countA = 0, countB = 0;
        int n = colors.size(), i = 0;

        while (i < n) {
            char cur = colors[i];
            int j = i;
            while (j < n && colors[j] == cur) ++j;
            int len = j - i;
            if (cur == 'A')
                countA += max(len - 2, 0);
            else
                countB += max(len - 2, 0);
            i = j;
        }
        return countA > countB;
    }
};
```

> Compile with `-std=c++17` or `-std=c++14` – LeetCode uses C++17 by default.
