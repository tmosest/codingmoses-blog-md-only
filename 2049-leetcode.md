> **Why O(n) Works**  
> Each node is visited exactly once.  
> - Building the adjacency list is **O(n)**.  
> - The DFS computes subtree sizes in a single post‚Äëorder pass ‚Äì again **O(n)**.  
> The only heavy operation is multiplication of at most 2‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚Åµ numbers, which fits easily in 64‚Äëbit (`long`/`long long`).

> **Handling the Root**  
> The root has no ‚Äúparent side‚Äù subtree.  
> In the formula `rest = n - total - 1`, `rest` is zero for the root (there is no node above it).  
> We multiply by `rest` only when it‚Äôs >‚ÄØ0; otherwise we simply ignore that factor ‚Äì this keeps the score correct for the root.

> **Edge‚ÄëCase Checklist**  
> * `n = 2` ‚Äì only the root and one leaf; score = 1, answer = 1.  
> * All nodes are leaves ‚Äì every score = 1, answer = n.  
> * Very unbalanced tree (a chain) ‚Äì `rest` may be zero many times, but the logic still works.

> **Common Pitfalls**  
> 1. Using `int` for the score can overflow (max score can be ~2‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10¬π‚Å∞).  
> 2. Forgetting to subtract the current node (`-1`) when computing `rest`.  
> 3. Mis‚Äëordering the DFS (pre‚Äëorder vs post‚Äëorder) ‚Äì you must first know child sizes before computing the node‚Äôs score.

> **Time & Space**  
> *Time:* **O(n)**  
> *Space:* **O(n)** for the adjacency list + recursion stack (‚â§‚ÄØn).

### üìå Introduction  
If you‚Äôre chasing your first software‚Äëengineering role or brushing up for a coding interview, **LeetCode‚ÄØ2049 ‚Äì ‚ÄúCount Nodes With the Highest Score‚Äù** is a classic problem that tests your understanding of trees, recursion, and careful arithmetic. Below we dissect the problem, walk through a clean O(n) solution, and highlight what makes it a *great interview question* (the ‚Äúgood‚Äù), what pitfalls keep candidates stuck (the ‚Äúbad‚Äù), and the common messy patterns that can lead to bugs (the ‚Äúugly‚Äù).  

---

### üìú Problem Statement  
> You are given a binary tree of `n` nodes (0‚Äëbased indexing) described by the array `parents`, where `parents[i]` is the parent of node `i` (the root has `-1`).  
> For each node, you remove it and compute the product of the sizes of all resulting connected components.  
> The *score* of a node is that product.  
> **Task**: Return how many nodes achieve the highest score.

---

### üîç Key Insight ‚Äì DFS + Subtree Size  
The problem boils down to two facts:  

1. **When you delete a node, every child becomes a separate component whose size equals its subtree size.**  
2. **The remaining nodes (all that are not in any child subtree) form one more component** ‚Äì the ‚Äúrest‚Äù of the tree.

Therefore, if you know the size of every subtree, you can compute the score for each node in a single bottom‚Äëup pass.  

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Solution Overview  
We build an adjacency list (`children`) and perform a post‚Äëorder DFS that returns the size of the subtree rooted at the current node.

During the DFS:

1. For each child `c`, recursively compute `size_c`.  
2. Multiply the running product (`score`) by `size_c`.  
3. Accumulate `total += size_c`.  
4. After exploring all children, the number of remaining nodes is  
   `rest = n - total - 1`.  
5. If `rest > 0`, multiply `score` by `rest`.  
6. Track the maximum score seen so far and count how many nodes hit it.

All arithmetic uses 64‚Äëbit integers (`long`/`long long`) to avoid overflow.

---

## üìà Complexity Analysis  

| Step | Cost |
|------|------|
| Building adjacency list | **O(n)** |
| DFS traversal | **O(n)** (each node visited once) |
| Memory | **O(n)** (adjacency list + recursion stack) |

Thus the overall solution runs in **O(n)** time and **O(n)** space ‚Äì the optimal for this problem.

## üìö Language‚ÄëSpecific Implementations  

### 1. Java  
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int countHighestScoreNodes(int[] parents) {
        int n = parents.length;
        List<Integer>[] children = new ArrayList[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) children[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) children[parents[i]].add(i);

        long[] maxScore = new long[1];   // use array to allow modification in nested lambda
        int[]   answer  = new int[1];

        // Post‚Äëorder DFS implemented via a private method
        int dfs(int node) {
            long score = 1;
            int sum = 0;
            for (int child : children[node]) {
                int sz = dfs(child);
                score *= sz;
                sum += sz;
            }
            int rest = n - sum - 1;
            if (rest > 0) score *= rest;

            if (score > maxScore[0]) { maxScore[0] = score; answer[0] = 1; }
            else if (score == maxScore[0]) { answer[0]++; }

            return sum + 1;
        }

        dfs(0);
        return answer[0];
    }
}
```

    def countHighestScoreNodes(self, parents: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(parents)
        children = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(1, n):
            children[parents[i]].append(i)

        self.max_score = 0
        self.answer = 0

        def dfs(node: int) -> int:
            score = 1
            total = 0

                sz = dfs(child)
                score *= sz
                total += sz
            rest = n - total - 1
            if rest > 0:
                score *= rest
            if score > self.max_score:
                self.max_score = score
                self.answer = 1
            elif score == self.max_score:
                self.answer += 1
            return total + 1

        dfs(0)
        return self.answer
```

### 3. C++

        long long maxScore = 0;
        int answer = 0;

        function<int(int)> dfs = [&](int node) -> int {
            long long score = 1;
            int sum = 0;
            for (int ch : child[node]) {
                int sz = dfs(ch);
                score *= sz;
                sum += sz;
            }
            int rest = n - sum - 1;
            if (rest > 0) score *= rest;

            if (score > maxScore) { maxScore = score; answer = 1; }
            else if (score == maxScore) { ++answer; }

            return sum + 1;
        };

## üöÄ The ‚ÄúGood‚Äù ‚Äì Why This Solution Rocks  

| ‚úîÔ∏è Feature | Why it matters |
|------------|----------------|
| **Linear time** | Interviewers love O(n) ‚Äì it shows you understand tree traversal. |
| **Clear separation of concerns** | Building adjacency ‚Üí DFS ‚Üí score calculation. |
| **Safe arithmetic** | Using `long / long long` prevents overflow on 2‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚Åµ nodes. |
| **Post‚Äëorder traversal** | Guarantees child subtree sizes are known before computing a parent‚Äôs score. |
| **In‚Äëplace state tracking** | No need for an auxiliary array to store all scores ‚Äì we update `maxScore` and `result` on the fly. |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The ‚ÄúBad‚Äù ‚Äì Common Mistakes That Make You Lose Points  

| ‚ùå Mistake | Impact | Fix |
|------------|--------|-----|
| Using `int` for score | Overflow ‚Üí wrong answers | Switch to `long` (`long long` in C++/Java) |
| Forgetting `-1` when computing `rest` | Adds an extra node to the rest component | `rest = n - total - 1` |
| Not handling `rest = 0` (root) | Multiplying by 0 kills the product | Multiply only if `rest > 0` |
| Pre‚Äëorder DFS without memo | Children not processed yet ‚Üí missing subtree size | Use post‚Äëorder (return size) |
| Ignoring recursion stack limit | Stack overflow on deep trees | Tail‚Äërecursive or iterative DFS if language permits |

---

## üé≠ The ‚ÄúUgly‚Äù ‚Äì Messy Patterns That Lead to Bugs  

| üôÉ Pattern | Why it‚Äôs ugly | Cleaner alternative |
|------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Building `rest` as `n - total` (forgetting `-1`) | Adds an invisible component of size 0 | `rest = n - total - 1` |
| Recursion returning a pair `(size, score)` | Over‚Äëengineering; two‚Äëlayer loops | Keep score updated during traversal |
| Storing all component sizes in a separate vector | Unnecessary memory | Compute and discard as soon as you finish a node |
| Using global variables without encapsulation | Hard to reason / test | Pass them as parameters or store in a small wrapper struct |

---

## üì£ Final Takeaway  
LeetCode‚ÄØ2049 is more than a trick question ‚Äì it forces you to think **about the consequences of cutting a node**. Master the O(n) DFS trick, avoid the overflow traps, and you‚Äôll impress both the hiring manager and the algorithmic blackboard.  

> **Pro‚ÄëTip**: When practicing, try writing the solution in **two** languages (e.g., Java & Python). It trains you to translate algorithmic ideas across ecosystems‚Äîa vital skill when interviewing for roles that use heterogeneous tech stacks.

Good luck, and happy coding! üöÄ
