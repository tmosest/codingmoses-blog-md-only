        ## 1.  Code Solutions

Below are clean, production‑ready solutions for LeetCode 2052 – *Minimum Cost to Separate Sentence Into Rows*.  
Each implementation follows the same DP idea but uses the idiomatic style of the chosen language.

> **Tip** – The time limit on LeetCode for this problem is generous, but if you want to be safe on very large inputs, use the **O(n²)** DP with memoization or a bottom‑up table.  
> **Space** – All three solutions run in *O(n)* auxiliary space (apart from the output array).  

### 1.1  Java – Top‑Down Memoization

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    // memo[i] = minimum cost starting from word i
    private int[] memo;

    public int minimumCost(String sentence, int k) {
        String[] words = sentence.split(" ");
        int n = words.length;
        memo = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(memo, -1);          // -1 = not computed
        return dfs(0, words, k);
    }

    private int dfs(int i, String[] words, int k) {
        if (i >= words.length) return 0;      // reached end – last line cost 0

        if (memo[i] != -1) return memo[i];

        int lineLen = k;            // characters left in current line
        int best = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int j = i; j < words.length; j++) {
            lineLen -= words[j].length();     // place word j
            if (lineLen < 0) break;           // cannot fit more words

            int cost = (j == words.length - 1) ? 0 : lineLen * lineLen;
            best = Math.min(best, cost + dfs(j + 1, words, k));

            lineLen--;                         // account for the space after word j
        }
        memo[i] = best;
        return best;
    }
}
```

*Why it works:*  
The recursive function tries every possible break point after the current word `i`.  
If we finish the sentence, no cost is added for the last line (by definition).  
The memo array guarantees that each starting index is evaluated only once, giving an **O(n²)** time complexity.

### 1.2  Python – `functools.lru_cache` (Top‑Down)

```python
from functools import lru_cache
import sys

class Solution:
    def minimumCost(self, sentence: str, k: int) -> int:
        words = sentence.split()
        n = len(words)

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i: int) -> int:
            if i == n:
                return 0                    # last line – cost 0

            remaining = k
            best = sys.maxsize

            for j in range(i, n):
                remaining -= len(words[j])
                if remaining < 0:
                    break                    # cannot add more words
                # cost of this line (except the last)
                cost = 0 if j == n - 1 else remaining * remaining
                best = min(best, cost + dp(j + 1))
                remaining -= 1              # space after words[j]

            return best

        return dp(0)
```

*Why it works:*  
The `lru_cache` decorator gives us memoization for free.  
We iterate over all possible break points from the current word `i`.  
The last line receives a cost of `0`.  
The algorithm runs in *O(n²)* time and *O(n)* space.

### 1.3  C++ – Bottom‑Up DP

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumCost(string sentence, int k) {
        vector<string> words;
        string w;
        stringstream ss(sentence);
        while (ss >> w) words.push_back(w);

        int n = words.size();
        const int INF = 1e9;
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, INF);
        dp[n] = 0;                            // base: after last word

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            int lineLen = k;
            for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                lineLen -= words[j].size();
                if (lineLen < 0) break;      // no more words fit

                int cost = (j == n - 1) ? 0 : lineLen * lineLen;
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], cost + dp[j + 1]);

                lineLen--;                    // space after words[j]
            }
        }
        return dp[0];
    }
};
```

*Why it works:*  
The bottom‑up loop mirrors the top‑down recursion but avoids recursion overhead.  
`dp[i]` stores the minimum cost from word `i` to the end.  
The inner loop tries all valid next break points.  
The result is in `dp[0]`.  
Complexity is again **O(n²)** time, **O(n)** space.

## 2.  Blog Article: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of LeetCode 2052

### 2.1  Introduction

**LeetCode 2052 – “Minimum Cost to Separate Sentence Into Rows”** is a classic **dynamic‑programming** problem that tests your ability to optimize with *penalty* functions.  
It’s a perfect interview question for junior‑to‑mid‑level roles in software engineering, data‑science, or algorithm‑centric positions.  

> **SEO keywords** – Minimum Cost to Separate Sentence Into Rows, LeetCode 2052, dynamic programming, Java, Python, C++, coding interview, algorithm design, job interview preparation, coding challenge.

### 2.2  Problem Recap

You’re given:
- A sentence of lowercase words separated by a single space.
- A maximum row width `k`.

**Goal** – Split the sentence into lines such that each line has at most `k` characters (spaces counted).  
The cost of a non‑last line is `(k - lineLength)²`.  
Return the *minimum total cost*.

### 2.3  The Good – What Works Out‑of‑the‑Box

| Aspect | Why it’s Good |
|--------|--------------|
| **Linear Space** | Each implementation only keeps `O(n)` state – the memo table or DP array. |
| **Intuitive Recurrence** | “Try all possible next line breaks” is a natural DP formulation. |
| **No Extra Libraries** | Solutions rely only on standard libraries (Java’s `Arrays`, Python’s `functools`, C++ STL). |
| **Scales to Constraints** | With `n <= 5000`, the `O(n²)` DP (≈ 25 million iterations) comfortably fits within typical LeetCode time limits. |

### 2.4  The Bad – Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Off‑by‑One Errors in Spaces** | Remember to subtract 1 for the space *after* each word **except** the last word in the line. |
| **Cost for Last Line** | Many coders mistakenly add `(k - lineLen)²` for the final row. The statement says **“except the last one”**. |
| **Large Recursion Depth** | In languages with limited stack (Python, Java), deep recursion (`n=5000`) may overflow. Use `@lru_cache` or iterative DP. |
| **Wrong Data Types** | The cost can reach `k²` (≈ 25 million). In 32‑bit languages, `int` is fine, but beware overflow in languages like C# or when using 32‑bit integers in other contexts. |

### 2.5  The Ugly – Edge‑Case Tricky Bits

1. **Single Word Sentences**  
   *Case:* `"a"` with `k = 5`.  
   *Behavior:* Only one line – cost should be `0`.  
   *Bug:* Some DP implementations treat `k - lineLen` as `0` for the only line, leading to a *false* positive cost.

2. **Word Length Exactly `k`**  
   *Case:* `"abcdefgh"` with `k = 8`.  
   *Behavior:* Must be on its own line; cost `0`.  
   *Bug:* Failing to account for the *space* after the word can cause an overflow of the line length.

3. **Maximum Size**  
   *Case:* `sentence.length = 5000`, all words of length 1.  
   *Complexity:* `n²` ~ 25M iterations; Python might be slow if not using `lru_cache`.  
   *Optimization:* Use `sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)` or an iterative bottom‑up DP in Python.

### 2.6  The DP Recurrence – A Step‑by‑Step Walkthrough

Let `words` be an array of the sentence’s words, `n = words.length`.  
Define `dp[i]` = minimum cost for the sub‑sentence starting at word `i`.  
Base: `dp[n] = 0` (no words left → last line, cost 0).

For `i` from `n-1` down to `0`:

1. `lineLen = k` (characters remaining in the current line).
2. For each `j` from `i` to `n-1`:
   - Subtract the length of `words[j]` from `lineLen`.  
   - If `lineLen < 0`, break (cannot fit).
   - Compute `cost = (lineLen)²` if `j != n-1` else `0`.
   - Update `dp[i] = min(dp[i], cost + dp[j+1])`.
   - Decrement `lineLen` by `1` to account for the space that would follow `words[j]`.

Return `dp[0]`.

**Why the recurrence is correct?**  
Each decision chooses a breakpoint after word `j`.  
The line cost is fully determined by the remaining characters (`k - lineLen`).  
Adding the optimal cost of the remaining suffix (`dp[j+1]`) guarantees optimality by the principle of optimal substructure.

### 2.7  Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| Top‑Down Memoization (Java, Python) | **O(n²)** | **O(n)** |
| Bottom‑Up DP (C++, Java, Python) | **O(n²)** | **O(n)** |

With `n ≤ 5000`, the worst‑case operations are ~25 million – comfortably within 1‑second limits on modern judges.

### 2.8  Testing & Validation

| Test | Description | Expected |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `("i love leetcode", 12)` | Example 1 | 36 |
| `("apples and bananas taste great", 7)` | Example 2 | 21 |
| `("a", 5)` | Single word | 0 |
| `("abcdefgh", 8)` | Word exactly fits | 0 |
| `("a a a a a", 2)` | Many short words | 4 |
| `("a b c d e f g h i j", 10)` | Edge case | 0 |

Automate these checks in your unit tests; remember to shuffle the order of word splits to verify your handling of spaces.

### 2.9  Tips for the Interview

1. **Explain the Recurrence Clearly** – Show the principle of optimal substructure.  
2. **Address Edge Cases Early** – Highlight how you handle the “last line cost” rule.  
3. **Mention Space Complexity** – Interviewers often care about memory usage as much as runtime.  
4. **If Using Recursion, Show Iterative Option** – Mention that you can refactor to bottom‑up if recursion depth is a concern.  
5. **Time Complexity** – Talk about `O(n²)` and why it’s acceptable under constraints.  
6. **Discuss Potential Optimizations** – For instance, pre‑computing prefix sums of word lengths to avoid repeated `len()` calls.

### 2.10  Final Takeaway

LeetCode 2052 is a **clean, well‑structured DP problem** that, when solved correctly, demonstrates your ability to:
- Translate a word‑problem into an algorithmic recurrence.
- Carefully manage off‑by‑one errors.
- Optimize within tight constraints.

Use the **code snippets** above as a reference.  
Practice on similar “penalty‑based” formatting problems (e.g., **Text Justification** or **Word Wrap**) to deepen your intuition.

Good luck on your next coding interview!
