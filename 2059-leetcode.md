        ## üöÄ LeetCode 2059 ‚Äì Minimum Operations to Convert Number  
*BFS, DP, Java | Python | C++ ‚Äì Your ‚ÄúGood, the Bad, and the Ugly‚Äù Guide*

### üìñ Problem Summary  
Given a distinct integer array `nums`, a starting value `start` (0‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØstart‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ1000) and a target `goal`, we can apply the following operations repeatedly while `x` stays inside the range `[0, 1000]`:

| operation | description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `x + nums[i]` | Add a value from the array |
| `x - nums[i]` | Subtract a value from the array |
| `x ^ nums[i]` | Bitwise XOR with a value from the array |

If an operation would take `x` outside the range, we are allowed to perform that operation **once** ‚Äì after that we cannot continue.  
Return the minimum number of operations needed to reach `goal` from `start`, or `-1` if impossible.

> **Constraints**  
> - `1¬†‚â§¬†nums.length¬†‚â§¬†1000`  
> - `-10‚Åπ¬†‚â§¬†nums[i],¬†goal¬†‚â§¬†10‚Åπ`  
> - `0¬†‚â§¬†start¬†‚â§¬†1000`  
> - `start¬†‚â†¬†goal`

## üîé Key Observations

1. **Only values 0‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØ1000 can be expanded**.  
   Once we step out of this window, the path ends ‚Äì we just need to check if that step equals `goal`.

2. **The state space is tiny (1001 states)**.  
   This allows an exhaustive search like BFS or a bottom‚Äëup DP without memory worries.

3. **Operations are reversible**.  
   The graph is undirected: from `x` we can reach `y`, and from `y` we can come back to `x` with the same element.  
   Therefore we can run the BFS **from the goal** or **from the start** ‚Äì both are optimal.

---

## üß† Algorithm ‚Äì Breadth‚ÄëFirst Search (BFS)

1. **Initialize**  
   - `queue` with the start value (or goal, see note below).  
   - `visited[0‚Ä¶1000]` to keep track of already explored states.  
   - `steps = 0`.

2. **Loop**  
   While the queue isn‚Äôt empty:  
   - Process all nodes of the current level (`size = queue.size()`).
   - For each `x` in this level, try all three operations with every `nums[i]`.
   - If the resulting `y` equals `goal`, return `steps + 1`.
   - If `0¬†‚â§¬†y¬†‚â§¬†1000` **and** not visited, mark visited and enqueue.

3. **Increment** `steps` after finishing a level.

4. If the queue empties without finding `goal`, return `-1`.

> **Why BFS works** ‚Äì BFS explores nodes by increasing distance from the start, guaranteeing the first time we hit `goal` we used the fewest operations.

## üì¶ Code (Java, Python, C++)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minimumOperations(int[] nums, int start, int goal) {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[1001];
        Queue<Integer> q = new ArrayDeque<>();
        q.offer(start);
        int steps = 0;

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int x = q.poll();
                for (int n : nums) {
                    int[] next = {x + n, x - n, x ^ n};
                    for (int y : next) {
                        if (y == goal) return steps + 1;
                        if (y >= 0 && y <= 1000 && !visited[y]) {
                            visited[y] = true;
                            q.offer(y);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

        steps = 0

        while q:
            for _ in range(len(q)):

                            return steps + 1
                        if 0 <= y <= 1000 and not visited[y]:
                            visited[y] = True
                            q.append(y)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOperations(vector<int>& nums, int start, int goal) {
        vector<bool> visited(1001, false);
        queue<int> q;
        q.push(start);
        int steps = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int sz = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < sz; ++i) {
                int x = q.front(); q.pop();
                for (int n : nums) {
                    int ops[3] = {x + n, x - n, x ^ n};
                    for (int y : ops) {
                        if (y == goal) return steps + 1;
                        if (0 <= y && y <= 1000 && !visited[y]) {
                            visited[y] = true;
                            q.push(y);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            ++steps;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

## üîç Complexity Analysis

| **Metric** | **Value** |
|------------|-----------|
| Time | `O(1001 * |nums|)` (worst‚Äëcase ~ 1‚ÄØmillion operations) |
| Memory | `O(1001)` for the visited array + queue |

The tiny state space makes the algorithm essentially constant‚Äëtime for interview constraints.

## ‚úÖ Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

| Aspect | Good | The Bad | The Ugly |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| **Algorithm choice** | BFS guarantees optimality, very clear for candidates | None ‚Äì BFS is always fine here | None ‚Äì the problem is designed for BFS, no hidden pitfalls |
| **State space** | Only 1001 states ‚Üí easy to reason | The `goal` may lie outside `[0,1000]` ‚Äì remember to check it before discarding | Enqueuing too many nodes if `visited` is omitted ‚Üí exponential blow‚Äëup |
| **Implementation** | Boolean array of size 1001 instead of a `HashSet` ‚Üí O(1) lookup | If you forget to check `y == goal` before the `[0,1000]` guard, you‚Äôll miss solutions that jump out of range | Using recursion or DFS without level tracking can lead to stack overflow or wrong answer |

---

## üéØ Edge Cases to Cover in Your Tests

1. **Goal inside the range** ‚Äì normal BFS path.  
2. **Goal outside the range** ‚Äì last operation must be the one that lands exactly on `goal`.  
3. **All operations keep you in `[0,1000]`** ‚Äì path never exits.  
4. **Negative `nums[i]` values** ‚Äì subtraction may become positive, XOR is unaffected.  
5. **Large `nums[i]` values** (close to `10‚Åπ`) ‚Äì ensure int doesn‚Äôt overflow (in Java/C++ the max sum stays <‚ÄØ2¬≥¬π).  

---

## üîÅ Bottom‚ÄëUp DP Variant (Optional)

If you prefer a *dynamic programming* flavor, run the BFS **from the goal** and build a table of distances. The code below is a more compact version of the Java solution; it works identically.

```java
boolean[] dist = new boolean[1001];
int[] queue = new int[1001];
int head = 0, tail = 0;
queue[tail++] = goal;
dist[goal] = true;
...
```

## üìã How to Use These Solutions in Your Interview

1. **Explain the graph model** ‚Äì ‚Äústates are numbers, edges are the three operations.‚Äù  
2. **Justify BFS** ‚Äì it guarantees minimal steps.  
3. **Show the code** ‚Äì highlight the level‚Äëby‚Äëlevel loop and the out‚Äëof‚Äërange check.  
4. **Discuss complexity** ‚Äì it runs in constant time for the 0‚Äì1000 window.  

---

## üéØ Summary

- The problem is a **short‚Äëpath search on a 1001‚Äënode graph**.  
- A simple **BFS** from `start` (or `goal`) finds the minimum operations instantly.  
- The code works cleanly in Java, Python, and C++, making it a great interview staple.
