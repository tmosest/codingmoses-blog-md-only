        ## üì¶ 2071 ‚Äì **Maximum Number of Tasks You Can Assign**  
> **Difficulty**: Hard  
> **Tags**: Greedy, Binary Search, Two‚ÄëPointers, Sorting

### TL;DR  
- Sort `tasks` (ascending) and `workers` (ascending).  
- Binary‚Äësearch the answer (`mid` = number of tasks you‚Äôre trying to satisfy).  
- For each `mid` run a greedy *can‚Äëassign* check:  
  1. Try to satisfy the hardest task with the strongest un‚Äëboosted worker.  
  2. If the worker isn‚Äôt strong enough, see if a weaker worker can be boosted with a pill (and we still have pills left).  
  3. If no worker (with or without a pill) can handle the task ‚Üí `mid` is impossible.  
- The largest feasible `mid` is the answer.

The algorithm runs in `O((n+m) log(min(n,m)) + n log n + m log m)` time and `O(n+m)` extra space.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Java (Java¬†17)

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int maxTaskAssign(int[] tasks, int[] workers, int pills, int strength) {
        int n = tasks.length, m = workers.length;
        int lo = 0, hi = Math.min(n, m);

        Arrays.sort(tasks);          // ascending
        Arrays.sort(workers);        // ascending

        while (lo < hi) {
            int mid = (lo + hi + 1) >>> 1; // candidate number of tasks
            if (canAssign(tasks, workers, mid, pills, strength)) {
                lo = mid;                // mid is feasible ‚Üí search higher
            } else {
                hi = mid - 1;            // mid too high ‚Üí search lower
            }
        }
        return lo;
    }

    private boolean canAssign(int[] tasks, int[] workers,
                              int taskCount, int pills, int strength) {
        int w = workers.length - 1;          // index of strongest free worker
        int freePills = pills;               // pills left

        // Work from hardest task to easiest
        for (int t = taskCount - 1; t >= 0; --t) {
            int difficulty = tasks[t];

            // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prefer a worker without a pill
            if (w >= 0 && workers[w] >= difficulty) {
                w--;                          // consume this worker
                continue;
            }

            // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Try to boost a weaker worker (if we still have pills)
            //   We look for the *weakest* worker that can be boosted to satisfy
            //   the current task. Because both arrays are sorted ascending,
            //   any worker that satisfies `worker + strength >= difficulty`
            //   must be *not stronger* than the current worker we are scanning.
            //   So we scan backwards until we hit a worker that, after boost,
            //   meets the difficulty.
            while (w >= 0 && workers[w] + strength >= difficulty) {
                // Push this worker into a queue of "boosted" workers
                // (they will be popped later if we run out of pills)
                // We‚Äôll use a stack‚Äëlike structure to keep the order.
                // Using a simple int array as a stack here is enough.
                if (freePills == 0) {
                    // No pills left ‚Üí impossible
                    return false;
                }
                // Use a pill on this worker
                freePills--;
                // This worker can now handle the task, so consume it
                w--;
                break;
            }

            // If we reach here, the current task cannot be satisfied
            // with any remaining worker/pill combination
            if (w < 0 && freePills == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

> **Why this Java version works?**  
> 1. The `canAssign` routine is **O(taskCount)** because we walk once over the strongest workers and use a simple counter for pills.  
> 2. The outer binary search runs `log(min(n,m))` times, giving the overall complexity.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Problem in a Nutshell

> *You‚Äôre given `tasks` (difficulty levels) and `workers` (strength).  
> A worker can do a task if his strength ‚â• difficulty.  
> You also have a limited number of pills (`pills`) that temporarily add `strength` to a worker.  
> What‚Äôs the maximum number of tasks you can complete?*

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why Is This Problem Hard?

| Aspect | Why it‚Äôs tricky |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Multiple constraints** | You must juggle three variables: tasks, workers, pills. A simple greedy ‚Äúassign the strongest worker to the hardest task‚Äù can fail because you might waste a pill on a weak worker when a stronger worker could have done the job unboosted. |
| **Non‚Äëmonotonic decisions** | A decision that seems good locally (boost the weakest worker) might block a better global assignment. |
| **Large input** | `n, m ‚â§ 2¬∑10‚Åµ`. Brute‚Äëforce approaches that try all subsets are impossible. |

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The ‚ÄúGood Old‚Äù Na√Øve Approach

> *Sort workers descending, sort tasks descending, then for each task, pick the first worker that can handle it (boosting if necessary).*  
> This fails because you might consume a pill on a worker who could otherwise be paired with a later task, while a stronger worker is left idle.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Real‚ÄëWorld Analogy

Think of a software team.  
You have a set of **features** (tasks) and a set of **developers** (workers).  
You have a limited number of **mentorship hours** (`pills`) that can temporarily boost a junior developer‚Äôs knowledge (`strength`).  
If you assign the mentorship to the least experienced developer on a feature that a senior could‚Äôve done, you waste scarce mentorship time, potentially missing out on bigger projects.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ The Elegant Solution: Binary Search + Greedy Check

#### 4.1 Conceptual Overview

1. **Sort** both arrays ‚Äì this gives us order for greedy decisions.  
2. **Binary search** the answer: If you can finish `mid` tasks, try more; if not, try fewer.  
3. **Greedy feasibility check** ‚Äì for each task (hardest ‚Üí easiest), pick the strongest worker that can do it. If not, look for a weaker worker that can be boosted.  
4. **Stop when** you hit a task that cannot be satisfied ‚Üí `mid` is impossible.

#### 4.2 The ‚ÄúCan‚ÄëAssign‚Äù Greedy

> **Why it works**:  
> We process tasks in decreasing difficulty; this guarantees that when we consider a task, any worker left after the loop is either *too weak* or *already assigned*.  
> By always choosing the *strongest* unboosted worker first, we avoid ‚Äúover‚Äëboosting‚Äù.  
> If we must use a pill, we pick the *weakest* worker that can be boosted ‚Äì this conserves pills for later tasks.

#### 4.3 Complexity Analysis

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Sorting `tasks`, `workers` | `O(n log n + m log m)` | `O(1)` |
| Binary Search | `O(log(min(n,m)))` | `O(1)` |
| Greedy Check | `O(taskCnt)` per iteration | `O(1)` |

Total: `O((n+m) log(min(n,m)))` time, `O(n+m)` space.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Misreading the monotonicity** ‚Äì assuming that boosting the weakest worker is always best.  
2. **Using a heap for the multiset when not needed** ‚Äì increases constant factors.  
3. **Off‚Äëby‚Äëone errors** ‚Äì remember the binary search uses `(lo + hi + 1) / 2` to avoid infinite loops.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Key Takeaways for the Interview

| Tip | Explanation |
|-----|-------------|
| **Explain your intuition** | Start by describing why a na√Øve greedy fails; then explain how binary search + greedy solves the issue. |
| **Discuss complexity upfront** | Recruiters love concise complexity arguments. |
| **Show the equivalence** | Demonstrate that the greedy check can be implemented in several languages (Java, Python, C++). |
| **Relate to real‚Äëworld scenarios** | Draw parallels to product management, resource allocation, or even drug dosage optimization. |

- **Tips**: Write out edge cases, run a hand‚Äëtrace, and then translate your reasoning into clean code.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Final Words

> *LeetCode 2071 is more than a coding challenge; it‚Äôs a lesson in resource optimization.  
> Mastering it not only gives you confidence for interviews but also sharpens your thinking for real‚Äëworld engineering problems where you must balance limited resources against demanding workloads.*

Good luck, and may your pills always be used wisely! üöÄ
