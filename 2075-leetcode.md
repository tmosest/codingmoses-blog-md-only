        ## 1.  Problem Recap  

**LeetCode 2075 – Decode the Slanted Ciphertext**  

```
decodeCiphertext(encodedText, rows)
```

The original message `originalText` was written into a grid with *rows* rows  
and enough columns so that the right‑most column is never empty.  
The filling order was *diagonal* – top‑left → bottom‑right.  
After the grid was built, the encoded string was read **row‑wise** and then
the characters of the same diagonals were concatenated in the order  
blue → red → yellow … (the order the cells were visited when filling).

Given the encoded string and the number of rows, recover the original
text (which never ends with a space).

The challenge is to reverse the diagonal encoding **without constructing the
whole matrix** – we only have the one‑dimensional encoded string.

---

## 2.  Key Insight  

If the grid has `R` rows and `C` columns, every cell on the same diagonal
is spaced by exactly `C + 1` positions in the flattened row‑wise string.

```
row 0:  0  1  2  3  ...  C-1
row 1:  C C+1 C+2 ...
row 2: 2C 2C+1 ...
```

The first element of the first diagonal is at index `0`,  
the second diagonal starts at index `1`, … the *j*‑th diagonal starts at
index `j`.  
We can therefore:

1. Compute `C = encodedText.length() / rows`.  
2. For each starting index `j = 0 … C-1`  
   traverse the diagonal by repeatedly adding `C+1` to the current index.  
3. Append every visited character to the answer.  
4. Finally, strip any trailing spaces that were only added during encoding.

This visits each character exactly once – **O(n)** time, **O(1)** extra space.

## 3.  Reference Solutions  

Below are three idiomatic implementations that follow the exact same logic.

| Language | Code | Comments |
|----------|------|----------|
| **Java** | ✅ | Uses `StringBuilder` and `stripTrailing()` (Java 11+) |
| **Python** | ✅ | Works with `strip()` – removes trailing spaces |
| **C++** | ✅ | Uses `string` and `erase` to trim spaces |

> **Why the “Most Intuitive Diagonal Traversal”?**  
> Because it mirrors the way the grid was originally filled – you walk along a diagonal, which is exactly how the encoded text was built.

### 3.1  Java 17 Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String decodeCiphertext(String encodedText, int rows) {
        int n = encodedText.length();
        int cols = n / rows;          // number of columns
        int step = cols + 1;          // jump to next cell on the same diagonal
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for (int start = 0; start < cols; start++) {
            for (int idx = start; idx < n; idx += step) {
                sb.append(encodedText.charAt(idx));
            }
        }

        // encodedText may contain trailing spaces – strip them
        return sb.toString().stripTrailing();
    }
}
```

**Complexity**

- **Time:** `O(n)` – each character is processed once.  
- **Space:** `O(n)` for the output string; `O(1)` auxiliary space.

### 3.2  Python 3 Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeCiphertext(self, encodedText: str, rows: int) -> str:
        n = len(encodedText)
        cols = n // rows          # number of columns
        step = cols + 1           # distance to the next diagonal cell

        res = []
        for start in range(cols):
            idx = start
            while idx < n:
                res.append(encodedText[idx])
                idx += step

        return "".join(res).rstrip()
```

---

### 3.3  C++17 Implementation

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string decodeCiphertext(string encodedText, int rows) {
        int n = encodedText.size();
        int cols = n / rows;          // columns count
        int step = cols + 1;          // diagonal step
        string res;

        for (int start = 0; start < cols; ++start) {
            for (int idx = start; idx < n; idx += step) {
                res += encodedText[idx];
            }
        }

        // trim trailing spaces
        while (!res.empty() && res.back() == ' ') res.pop_back();
        return res;
    }
};
```

### 4.3  Full Article (excerpt)

> **Decoding a Slanted Cipher: What Every Software Engineer Should Know**
>  
> In many interviews you’ll encounter problems that sound like they need a *grid*, *matrix* or *dynamic programming*. The slanted cipher is one of those deceptively simple challenges that actually tests your ability to think in terms of indexes rather than data structures.

> **The Good**  
> The elegant solution treats the encoded string as a *flattened* 2‑D array. The only trick?  
> **Diagonal steps equal `cols + 1`.**  
> This insight turns a potentially quadratic reconstruction into a single linear scan.

> **The Bad**  
> A first instinct is to rebuild the full matrix:  
> ```
> char[][] grid = new char[rows][cols];
> // fill diagonally, read rows, etc.
> ```  
> This is O(rows * cols) memory and still needs two passes.

> **The Ugly**  
> Edge cases bite the naive coder:  
> * `encodedText` could be empty (`""`).  
> * One row (`rows == 1`) – the output is identical.  
> * Trailing spaces inserted during encoding must be removed; otherwise the answer will be wrong.  
> Remember `stripTrailing()` (Java) or `rstrip()` (Python) – they’re lifesavers.

> **Java Implementation**  
> *(include code from 3.1 above)*

> **Python Implementation**  
> *(include code from 3.2 above)*

> **C++ Implementation**  
> *(include code from 3.3 above)*

> **Interview Tips**  
> 1. Clarify the grid size: `cols = encodedText.length() / rows`.  
> 2. Visualise the first few diagonals; write them on paper.  
> 3. Ask about the worst‑case length (10⁶) – this forces you to think about O(n) algorithms.  
> 4. Mention the trailing‑space edge case; recruiters love candidates who anticipate pitfalls.

> **TL;DR**  
> *Compute columns, step by `cols+1`, traverse diagonally, trim trailing spaces.*  
> It’s fast, clean, and demonstrates solid index‑manipulation skills.

## 5.  Final Thoughts

Decoding the slanted ciphertext is a perfect interview story:  
a seemingly intricate grid puzzle that, once you see the right pattern, collapses to a single linear pass.  
Implement the solution in your preferred language, test it against the edge cases, and remember to trim those pesky trailing spaces.
