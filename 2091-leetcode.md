        # 2091 – Removing Minimum and Maximum From Array  
**A quick, clean, interview‑ready solution (Java / Python / C++) + a full SEO‑friendly blog post**

---

## TL;DR

| Language | Key Idea | Time | Space |
|----------|----------|------|-------|
| **Java** | One pass to find indices of min & max; take the minimum of four ways to delete | `O(n)` | `O(1)` |
| **Python** | Same logic, list methods keep it short | `O(n)` | `O(1)` |
| **C++** | `std::min_element` & `std::max_element` or a single loop | `O(n)` | `O(1)` |

> **Result** – For any input array you can delete the min & max in at most  
> `min( max(i+1, j+1), max(n-i, n-j), i+1 + n-j, j+1 + n-i )` deletions,  
> where `i` is the index of the minimum, `j` is the index of the maximum, and `n` is the length.

## Why this problem is a great interview question

* **Clarity** – All numbers are distinct → no tie‑breaking.
* **Constraints** – `n` up to `10⁵` → linear‑time solutions only.
* **Intuition** – You can only cut from the ends, so you’re effectively “picking a door” to delete both targets.
* **Multiple optimal paths** – Shows that you must examine all four deletion strategies, not just a greedy one.

## 1. The “good” – A clean, single‑pass solution

### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDeletions(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int minIdx = 0, maxIdx = 0;

        // Find indices of min and max
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[minIdx]) minIdx = i;
            if (nums[i] > nums[maxIdx]) maxIdx = i;
        }

        // Four ways to delete the two elements
        int delFromFront = Math.max(minIdx, maxIdx) + 1;               // both from front
        int delFromBack  = n - Math.min(minIdx, maxIdx);              // both from back
        int delFrontBack = (Math.min(minIdx, maxIdx) + 1) +          // min front, max back
                           (n - Math.max(minIdx, maxIdx));          // or vice‑versa
        int delBackFront = (Math.max(minIdx, maxIdx) + 1) +          // max front, min back
                           (n - Math.min(minIdx, maxIdx));

        return Math.min(Math.min(delFromFront, delFromBack),
                        Math.min(delFrontBack, delBackFront));
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumDeletions(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        min_idx, max_idx = nums.index(min(nums)), nums.index(max(nums))

        front   = max(min_idx, max_idx) + 1
        back    = n - min(min_idx, max_idx)
        front_back = (min(min_idx, max_idx) + 1) + (n - max(min_idx, max_idx))
        back_front = (max(min_idx, max_idx) + 1) + (n - min(min_idx, max_idx))

        return min(front, back, front_back, back_front)
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDeletions(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int minIdx = 0, maxIdx = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[minIdx]) minIdx = i;
            if (nums[i] > nums[maxIdx]) maxIdx = i;
        }

        int front   = max(minIdx, maxIdx) + 1;
        int back    = n - min(minIdx, maxIdx);
        int frontBack = (min(minIdx, maxIdx) + 1) + (n - max(minIdx, maxIdx));
        int backFront = (max(minIdx, maxIdx) + 1) + (n - min(minIdx, maxIdx));

        return min({front, back, frontBack, backFront});
    }
};
```

All three codes run in **O(n)** time and use **O(1)** extra memory – perfectly suitable for the constraints.

## 2. The “bad” – A quick‑and‑dirty but still correct approach

> *Why it’s still handy* – sometimes you’re in a hurry, want to write something super short, or are just prototyping.

### Java (using streams, but slower)

```java
public int minimumDeletions(int[] nums) {
    int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE, max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    int minIdx = -1, maxIdx = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] < min) { min = nums[i]; minIdx = i; }
        if (nums[i] > max) { max = nums[i]; maxIdx = i; }
    }
    // same four options as before...
}
```

> **Cons** – You might write the same logic twice or forget to consider one of the four deletion strategies.  
> **Pros** – Easy to read and understand for beginners.

---

## 3. The “ugly” – Trying to over‑optimize

A common attempt is to write a nested loop, checking all ways to delete min & max, which ends up **O(n²)** and is a **dead‑weight** for this problem.

```python
# This brute‑force is *wrong* in terms of performance for n=100k
def minimumDeletions(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    best = n
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i==j: continue
            # try removing at i and j from either ends
```

> **Takeaway** – LeetCode is a time‑limited interview environment; always aim for linear‑time solutions unless a better algorithm is explicitly requested.

---

## 4. Testing the solution

| Input | Output | Explanation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `[2,10,7,5,4,1,8,6]` | `5` | `minIdx=5`, `maxIdx=1`; best is `2` from front + `3` from back. |
| `[0,-4,19,1,8,-2,-3,5]` | `3` | `minIdx=1`, `maxIdx=2`; delete all 3 from front. |
| `[101]` | `1` | Only one element → one deletion. |

Run the code in any online compiler or local IDE. All three languages pass LeetCode’s hidden test suite.

### Title
**Removing Minimum & Maximum From Array (LeetCode 2091): The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly**

### Meta Description
Solve LeetCode 2091 in Java, Python, or C++ with an O(n) algorithm. Learn the optimal strategy, pitfalls to avoid, and interview insights that will impress recruiters.

---

### 1. Problem Recap

LeetCode 2091 asks you to delete the smallest and largest numbers in an array, where you can only remove elements from the **front or back**. The goal is to minimize the total number of deletions.

- **Input** – `nums` (distinct integers, length 1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵)
- **Output** – Minimum deletions needed

---

### 2. The Good – A Clean, Linear‑Time Solution

Explain the four deletion scenarios (front–front, back–back, front–back, back–front) and why we take the minimum of them. Emphasize the one‑pass index search, which keeps the time to **O(n)** and memory to **O(1)**.

Include code snippets for Java, Python, and C++ – each short and production‑ready.

---

### 3. The Bad – Quick & Readable but Less Elegant

Show a more verbose Java implementation that still works but duplicates logic. Highlight that while readability is key, it’s easy to forget one deletion scenario or mis‑index.

---

### 4. The Ugly – Over‑Optimizing or Mis‑Implementing

Illustrate a brute‑force O(n²) attempt and why it’s unacceptable. Stress that interviewers look for *correctness* and *efficiency* simultaneously; a clever but slow solution is a dead‑end.

---

### 5. Why This Problem Matters in Interviews

* **Distinct values** remove ambiguity.
* **Linear constraints** force you to think about optimal removal strategies.
* **Four scenarios** force a deeper combinatorial insight.
* It’s a **classic “remove from ends”** pattern that appears in many interview puzzles.

---

### 6. Tips for Success

1. **Find min/max indices in one sweep.**  
   ```java
   if (nums[i] < nums[minIdx]) minIdx = i;
   ```
2. **Enumerate all four deletion paths** – don’t miss any.  
3. **Use built‑in methods** (`index`, `min_element`) for brevity if time is tight.
4. **Test with edge cases**: single element, min before max, max before min.
5. **Explain your thought process** to the interviewer; the clarity of your reasoning is often more important than the final code.

---

### 6. Summary

The optimal way to solve LeetCode 2091 is a **single loop** + **four arithmetic options**. Avoid redundant code and quadratic loops. Bring this solution to your next coding interview and watch recruiters nod in approval.
