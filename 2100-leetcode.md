        ## üõ†Ô∏è 3‚ÄëLanguage Solution ‚Äì Find Good Days to Rob the Bank (LeetCode 2100)

Below you‚Äôll find a clean, **O(n)** algorithm in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
All three implementations use the same two‚Äëpass prefix‚Äësuffix technique:

1. **decr[i]** ‚Äì number of consecutive non‚Äëincreasing days ending at *i* (look left ‚Üí right).  
2. **incr[i]** ‚Äì number of consecutive non‚Äëdecreasing days starting at *i* (look right ‚Üí left).  

A day *i* is ‚Äúgood‚Äù iff both counters are ‚â• `time`.

> üí° **Why this is the best approach?**  
> The brute‚Äëforce sliding window would be **O(n¬∑time)**, which can blow up when `time ‚âà 10‚Åµ`.  
> The prefix‚Äësuffix method gives a linear scan and is therefore optimal.

### Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> goodDaysToRobBank(int[] security, int time) {
        int n = security.length;
        int[] decr = new int[n];   // non‚Äëincreasing prefix
        int[] incr = new int[n];   // non‚Äëdecreasing suffix

        // left ‚Üí right : count consecutive non‚Äëincreasing days
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (security[i] <= security[i - 1]) {
                decr[i] = decr[i - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                decr[i] = 0;
            }
        }

        // right ‚Üí left : count consecutive non‚Äëdecreasing days
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (security[i] <= security[i + 1]) {
                incr[i] = incr[i + 1] + 1;
            } else {
                incr[i] = 0;
            }
        }

        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = time; i < n - time; i++) {
            if (decr[i] >= time && incr[i] >= time) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def goodDaysToRobBank(self, security: List[int], time: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(security)
        decr = [0] * n          # non‚Äëincreasing prefix
        incr = [0] * n          # non‚Äëdecreasing suffix

        # left ‚Üí right
        for i in range(1, n):
            decr[i] = decr[i-1] + 1 if security[i] <= security[i-1] else 0

        # right ‚Üí left
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            incr[i] = incr[i+1] + 1 if security[i] <= security[i+1] else 0

        return [i for i in range(time, n-time)
                if decr[i] >= time and incr[i] >= time]
```

### C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> goodDaysToRobBank(vector<int>& security, int time) {
        int n = security.size();
        vector<int> decr(n, 0), incr(n, 0);

        // left ‚Üí right: non‚Äëincreasing prefix
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            decr[i] = (security[i] <= security[i-1]) ? decr[i-1] + 1 : 0;

        // right ‚Üí left: non‚Äëdecreasing suffix
        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; --i)
            incr[i] = (security[i] <= security[i+1]) ? incr[i+1] + 1 : 0;

        vector<int> ans;
        for (int i = time; i < n - time; ++i)
            if (decr[i] >= time && incr[i] >= time)
                ans.push_back(i);

        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Introduction

> **Problem:** *Find Good Days to Rob the Bank* ‚Äì a medium‚Äëlevel challenge that tests your ability to reason about array prefixes, suffixes, and sliding windows.  
> **Goal:** Deliver a concise, **O(n)** solution that passes all edge cases.

In this post we‚Äôll explore:

1. The problem‚Äôs core mechanics.  
2. A *good* linear strategy.  
3. Common pitfalls (*the bad*).  
4. The subtle trick that makes the algorithm robust (*the ugly*).  

And we‚Äôll pepper the article with **SEO keywords** such as *LeetCode 2100*, *array prefix*, *dynamic programming*, *interview coding*, *Java Python C++ solutions* so you can get found on Google and land that job!

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Good

A *good day* requires **two symmetric patterns**:

- **Non‚Äëincreasing** guards for `time` days before `i`.  
- **Non‚Äëdecreasing** guards for `time` days after `i`.

The most na√Øve solution would check every candidate day with two loops, costing **O(n¬∑time)**. When `time` is as large as `10‚Åµ`, this becomes infeasible.

**Key insight:** The two patterns can be pre‚Äëcomputed with two linear passes:

| Pass | Direction | What we compute | Why it works |
|------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1 | left ‚Üí right | `decr[i]`: longest non‚Äëincreasing streak ending at `i` | If the streak length ‚â• `time`, we already know the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù part is fine. |
| 2 | right ‚Üí left | `incr[i]`: longest non‚Äëdecreasing streak starting at `i` | Symmetric reasoning for the ‚Äúafter‚Äù part. |

Once both arrays exist, a simple scan determines all good days in **O(n)** time.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Bad ‚Äì Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why it fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Using `>=` incorrectly** | Some implementations compare `security[i] < security[i-1]` instead of `<=`. This discards equal guard counts, which are allowed by the problem. | Use `<=` for the left‚Äëto‚Äëright pass and `<=` for the right‚Äëto‚Äëleft pass. |
| **Boundary errors** | Forgetting to exclude days that don‚Äôt have `time` days before or after (`i < time` or `i > n-1-time`). | Run the final loop from `i = time` to `i < n - time`. |
| **O(n¬≤) approach** | Brute‚Äëforce sliding window, recomputing sums each time. | Precompute prefix and suffix arrays instead of recomputing. |
| **Large memory waste** | Using a separate array for each guard trend, but not reusing them. | Only two `int` arrays of length `n` are needed; keep them local. |
| **Ignoring time = 0** | Returning an empty list because `time` is never checked. | If `time == 0`, all indices are valid ‚Äì the loop naturally handles this. |

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Ugly ‚Äì Edge Cases You Must Handle

1. **All equal values**  
   ```
   security = [5,5,5,5], time = 1
   ```
   Both `decr` and `incr` become `0,1,2,‚Ä¶`. Our logic (`>= time`) still works.

2. **Very small arrays**  
   ```
   security = [1], time = 0
   ```
   The algorithm gracefully returns `[0]` because the loop runs from `i=0` to `i < 1-0`.

3. **Large `time` approaching array length**  
   ```
   security = [1,2,3,4,5], time = 4
   ```
   No day satisfies the condition; the loop‚Äôs bounds (`i < n - time`) prevent any index from being considered.

4. **Negative guard counts?**  
   The problem guarantees non‚Äënegative integers, but our algorithm would still work because comparisons rely only on order, not absolute value.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Putting It All Together ‚Äì A Robust Implementation

Here‚Äôs the final, production‚Äëready Java code (you can copy‚Äëpaste it into a LeetCode editor):

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> goodDaysToRobBank(int[] security, int time) {
        int n = security.length;
        int[] decr = new int[n];   // longest non‚Äëincreasing prefix ending at i
        int[] incr = new int[n];   // longest non‚Äëdecreasing suffix starting at i

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            decr[i] = security[i] <= security[i-1] ? decr[i-1] + 1 : 0;
        }

        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; i--) {
            incr[i] = security[i] <= security[i+1] ? incr[i+1] + 1 : 0;
        }

        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = time; i < n - time; i++) {
            if (decr[i] >= time && incr[i] >= time) {
                res.add(i);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

The same pattern translates to Python (list comprehensions) and C++ (`vector<int>`), as shown earlier.
