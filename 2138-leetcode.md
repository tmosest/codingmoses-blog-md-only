## 📌 Problem Statement (LeetCode 2138)

> **Divide a String Into Groups of Size k**  
> **Difficulty:** Easy  

You are given a string `s`, an integer `k`, and a character `fill`.  
Partition the string into groups of length `k`:

1. The first group is the first `k` characters of `s`.
2. The second group is the next `k` characters, and so on.
3. For the final group, if there are fewer than `k` characters left, pad the group with the `fill` character until its length is `k`.  
4. After removing the padding from the last group, the concatenation of all groups must equal the original string `s`.

Return the list of all groups.

> **Examples**  
> ```text
> s = "abcdefghi", k = 3, fill = 'x' ➜ ["abc","def","ghi"]
> s = "abcdefghij", k = 3, fill = 'x' ➜ ["abc","def","ghi","jxx"]
> ```

> **Constraints**  
> - 1 ≤ s.length ≤ 100  
> - 1 ≤ k ≤ 100  
> - `s` consists of lowercase English letters  
> - `fill` is a lowercase English letter

## 💡 Core Idea

The problem is a simple string slicing exercise:

1. **Loop** over the string in steps of `k`.
2. **Take** a substring of length `k` (or the remaining part).
3. **Pad** the last substring with `fill` if it’s shorter than `k`.
4. **Store** each group in a list/array.

Time complexity: **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of `s`.  
Space complexity: **O(n)** for the resulting list.

## 📄 Code Solutions

Below are clean, production‑ready implementations in **Java, Python, and C++**.

### 1️⃣ Java

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public String[] divideString(String s, int k, char fill) {
        int n = s.length();
        int groups = (n + k - 1) / k;   // ceil division
        String[] result = new String[groups];

        for (int i = 0, idx = 0; i < n; i += k, idx++) {
            int end = Math.min(i + k, n);
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s.substring(i, end));

            // Pad only if this is the last group and it's short
            if (end < n + k && end - i < k) {
                for (int j = sb.length(); j < k; j++) {
                    sb.append(fill);
                }
            }
            result[idx] = sb.toString();
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### 2️⃣ Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def divideString(self, s: str, k: int, fill: str) -> List[str]:
        res = []
        for i in range(0, len(s), k):
            chunk = s[i:i + k]
            if len(chunk) < k:
                chunk += fill * (k - len(chunk))
            res.append(chunk)
        return res
```

### 3️⃣ C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<std::string> divideString(std::string s, int k, char fill) {
        std::vector<std::string> res;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < s.size(); i += k) {
            std::string chunk = s.substr(i, k);
            if (chunk.size() < static_cast<size_t>(k)) {
                chunk.append(k - chunk.size(), fill);
            }
            res.push_back(chunk);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

All three solutions run in linear time and use only a few auxiliary variables.

## 📈 Good, Bad, and Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Algorithmic Complexity** | O(n) time, O(n) space – optimal for any input size. | None – the solution is already optimal. | N/A |
| **Readability** | Uses clear variable names and a single loop. | Over‑complicated padding logic can be hard to read. | Nested loops or excessive string concatenation may be confusing. |
| **Language‑Specific Pitfalls** | Java: avoid `StringBuilder` in the inner loop to keep O(n) cost. | Python: slicing copies strings – still fine for given constraints. | C++: forgetting to `#include <string>` leads to compile errors. |
| **Edge Cases** | Handles empty strings, `k` equal to string length, and `k` larger than string length. | None. | Mistakenly using `fill` as a string instead of a character can break the logic. |
| **Maintainability** | The solution is concise and can be extended (e.g., returning a vector of strings). | None. | Hard‑to‑maintain code that pads in multiple places. |

### Takeaway

- **Good** – The linear scan with on‑the‑fly padding is both efficient and elegant.  
- **Bad** – Not really; the only “bad” is unnecessary complexity.  
- **Ugly** – Using string concatenation inside nested loops or failing to handle the last group properly can lead to subtle bugs.
