        ## 1Ô∏è‚É£  Code (Java / Python / C++) ‚Äì ‚ÄúCount the Hidden Sequences‚Äù

Below you‚Äôll find a **single‚Äëpass, O(n) / O(1) space** solution for LeetCode‚ÄØ#2145.  
All three versions use the same prefix‚Äësum trick that turns the problem into a simple range‚Äëcount.

| Language | Key points |
|----------|------------|
| **Java** | Uses `long` for prefix sums to avoid overflow, then casts the final answer to `int`. |
| **Python** | Straightforward loops, `max()`/`min()` calls, and a single arithmetic expression. |
| **C++** | Uses `long long`, `std::max`, `std::min`, and `std::max(0LL, res)` to guard against negative counts. |

### üìå Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfArrays(int[] differences, int lower, int upper) {
        long sum = 0, max = 0, min = 0;     // prefix sum and its extrema
        for (int d : differences) {
            sum += d;
            max = Math.max(max, sum);
            min = Math.min(min, sum);
        }
        // Count of valid starting values
        long res = (long) upper - lower - max + min + 1;
        return (int) Math.max(0L, res);
    }
}
```

---

### üìå Python

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfArrays(self, differences: List[int], lower: int, upper: int) -> int:
        sum_, max_, min_ = 0, 0, 0
        for d in differences:
            sum_ += d
            max_ = max(max_, sum_)
            min_ = min(min_, sum_)

        res = upper - lower - max_ + min_ + 1
        return max(0, res)
```

---

### üìå C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfArrays(vector<int>& diff, int lower, int upper) {
        long long sum = 0, maxSum = 0, minSum = 0;
        for (int d : diff) {
            sum += d;
            maxSum = max(maxSum, sum);
            minSum = min(minSum, sum);
        }
        long long res = (long long)upper - lower - maxSum + minSum + 1;
        return max(0LL, res);
    }
};
```

### 2.1  Introduction

If you‚Äôre preparing for a software‚Äëengineering interview, you‚Äôll soon encounter *prefix‚Äësum* problems.  
LeetCode‚Äôs **2145 ‚Äì ‚ÄúCount the Hidden Sequences‚Äù** is a perfect illustration.  
It asks you to count how many hidden arrays satisfy a given set of differences *and* lie within a numeric range.  
Below we break down the problem into the **good** (what works), the **bad** (common pitfalls), and the **ugly** (why it feels tricky).  

> **Goal**: Equip you with a clean, efficient solution and a deeper understanding that you can confidently explain in an interview.

---

### 2.2  Problem Restatement

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `differences` | `int[]` of length `n`. `differences[i] = hidden[i+1] - hidden[i]`. |
| `lower`, `upper` | Inclusive bounds for every element in the hidden array. |
| **Task** | Count the number of possible hidden arrays of length `n+1` that satisfy both constraints. Return `0` if none exist. |

---

### 2.3  Why Prefix Sums Shine

The hidden array can be expressed in terms of a starting value `x`:

```
hidden[0] = x
hidden[1] = x + differences[0]
hidden[2] = x + differences[0] + differences[1]
...
```

The **prefix sum** of `differences` gives the relative offset from `x` to any element.  
Let:

```
prefix[0] = 0
prefix[i] = sum_{j=0}^{i-1} differences[j]
```

Then `hidden[i] = x + prefix[i]`.  
All elements stay within `[lower, upper]` **iff**:

```
lower ‚â§ x + minPrefix  AND  x + maxPrefix ‚â§ upper
```

Rearranging:

```
lower - minPrefix ‚â§ x ‚â§ upper - maxPrefix
```

Thus, *every integer* `x` inside this interval produces a valid hidden array.  
The count is simply:

```
max(0, (upper - maxPrefix) - (lower - minPrefix) + 1)
```

**That‚Äôs the ‚Äúmagic formula‚Äù** behind the solution.

### 2.4  The Good ‚Äì A One‚ÄëPass, O(n) Solution

| Step | What we do | Why it matters |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Compute prefix sum, min, max** | Traverse `differences` once, accumulating `sum`, and track `maxSum` and `minSum`. | O(n) time, O(1) space ‚Äì the optimal solution. |
| **Apply the formula** | `upper - lower - maxSum + minSum + 1`. | Eliminates the need for nested loops or binary search. |
| **Guard against negatives** | `max(0, result)` | Some intervals collapse (e.g., if `upper < lower - minPrefix`) ‚Üí return 0. |

> **Result**: All three code snippets above implement this logic.

---

### 2.5  The Bad ‚Äì Common Missteps

1. **Overflow**  
   - `differences` can be ¬±10‚Åµ, and `n` can be 10‚Åµ.  
   - `sum` may reach ¬±10¬π‚Å∞, which exceeds `int`.  
   - **Fix**: Use `long` (Java/C++) or `long long` (C++) / default Python integers (arbitrary precision).  

2. **Mixing up min/max**  
   - Many people accidentally swap `minPrefix` and `maxPrefix` in the final formula.  
   - Remember: `minPrefix` is the *most negative* offset, so it **expands** the lower bound.  
   - Test with a small example (e.g., `differences = [1, -1]`) to see the numbers line up.

3. **Wrong interval direction**  
   - The interval may become empty if `upper - maxPrefix < lower - minPrefix`.  
   - `max(0, ‚Ä¶)` handles this elegantly.  

4. **Assuming the answer fits in an `int`**  
   - In this problem, `upper` and `lower` are limited to ¬±10‚Åµ, so the maximum count is ~2¬∑10‚Åµ.  
   - But always cast the final arithmetic expression to `long`/`long long` before returning, just in case.

### 2.6  The Ugly ‚Äì Understanding the Formula

> **Why it feels unnatural**  
> When you first see `upper - lower - max + min + 1`, it‚Äôs not obvious why ‚Äúmax‚Äù should be subtracted and ‚Äúmin‚Äù added.

**Why the signs appear the way they do:**

```
count = (upper - maxPrefix) - (lower - minPrefix) + 1
      = upper - maxPrefix - lower + minPrefix + 1
      = upper - lower - maxPrefix + minPrefix + 1
```

A helpful mental image: imagine two ‚Äúwalls‚Äù that squeeze `x`.  
The *right* wall is `upper - maxPrefix`; the *left* wall is `lower - minPrefix`.  
If you move both walls inwards, the number of integer points between them shrinks.  
This visual reasoning often comes up in interview explanations‚Äîbe ready to sketch it quickly.

---

### 2.7  Step‚Äëby‚ÄëStep Implementation (for Interviews)

Below is a minimal sketch you can paste into an IDE:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfArrays(int[] diff, int lower, int upper) {
        long sum = 0, maxSum = 0, minSum = 0;
        for (int d : diff) {
            sum += d;
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
            minSum = Math.min(minSum, sum);
        }
        long res = (long) upper - lower - maxSum + minSum + 1;
        return (int) Math.max(0L, res);
    }
}
```

- **Why `long`?**  
  Even though `differences` ‚â§‚ÄØ10‚Åµ, a cumulative sum of 10‚Åµ elements can reach ¬±10¬π‚Å∞, far outside the `int` range.

- **Why `max(0, ‚Ä¶)`?**  
  A negative result means the interval collapsed; no hidden array exists.

### 2.8  Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Value | Comment |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Time** | `O(n)` | Single traversal of `differences`. |
| **Space** | `O(1)` | Only a few `long` variables; no additional arrays. |
| **Answer Size** | ‚â§‚ÄØ`upper - lower + 1` ‚â§‚ÄØ200‚ÄØ001 | Fits comfortably in a 32‚Äëbit signed integer. |

---

### 2.9  Edge Cases to Test

| Test | Expected | Why it matters |
|------|----------|----------------|
| All differences‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0, `lower = 5`, `upper = 5` | 1 | Every element must be 5. |
| `differences = [5]`, `lower = 0`, `upper = 3` | 0 | Impossible because the second element would be ‚â•‚ÄØ5. |
| Mixed signs, e.g., `[-1, 3, -2]` | 2 | Demonstrates that negative prefixes still work. |
| `lower = -10‚Åµ`, `upper = 10‚Åµ`, large `differences` | 200‚ÄØ001 | Stress‚Äëtest the arithmetic for overflow. |

---

### 2.10  How to Explain It in an Interview

1. **State the observation**  
   ‚ÄúIf we choose a starting value `x`, every element is `x` plus a prefix sum.‚Äù

2. **Introduce the prefix array**  
   Show the derivation of `prefix[i]`.

3. **Translate the bounds**  
   Write the inequalities for `lower` and `upper` in terms of `x` and `prefix`.

4. **Simplify to an interval**  
   ‚ÄúThe valid starting values are the integers between `lower - minPrefix` and `upper - maxPrefix`.‚Äù

5. **Count the points**  
   Explain the arithmetic for counting inclusive integers.

6. **Show the one‚Äëpass algorithm**  
   Emphasize *time* and *space* optimality.

7. **Mention edge cases**  
   ‚ÄúWe clamp to zero if the interval is empty.‚Äù

### 2.11  Take‚ÄëAway Tips

| Tip | Why |
|-----|-----|
| **Keep a running prefix sum** | You‚Äôll be asked to do this in many interview questions. |
| **Track min/max during the same loop** | Eliminates a second pass. |
| **Always use 64‚Äëbit arithmetic** | Avoid subtle overflows that can break your answer. |
| **Visualise the interval for `x`** | Makes the ‚Äúmagic formula‚Äù intuitive. |
| **Check the ‚Äúzero‚Äëcase‚Äù** | A common oversight; remember `max(0, ‚Ä¶)` at the end. |

### 2.12  Conclusion

LeetCode‚ÄØ#2145 is a concise, elegant test of two core skills:

1. **Prefix‚Äësum reasoning** ‚Äì turning a seemingly complex constraint into a simple range problem.  
2. **Clean code** ‚Äì a single pass with O(1) space that you can explain in a few minutes.

Mastering this pattern boosts your confidence in *dynamic programming*, *array manipulation*, and *range counting*‚Äîskills that recruiters look for in full‚Äëstack and system‚Äëdesign roles.

**Ready to land that job?**  
- **Add this solution to your GitHub** and include a brief README explaining the algorithm.  
- **Practice explaining the derivation** out loud; this will help you articulate your thought process during a live interview.  
- **Pair‚Äëprogram with a friend** or use an online judge to rehearse under time pressure.

Happy coding‚Äîand may your next interview go as smoothly as this prefix‚Äësum sweep! üöÄ
