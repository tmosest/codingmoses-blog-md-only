        ## üéØ 2147.‚ÄØNumber of Ways to Divide a Long Corridor  
### (Hard) ‚Äì Leetcode, O(N) time, O(1) space

| Language |  Time  |  Space |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Java     |  O(n)  |  O(1)  |
| Python   |  O(n)  |  O(1)  |
| C++      |  O(n)  |  O(1)  |

### TL;DR  
1. **If the corridor contains an odd number of seats (`S`) ‚Üí answer = 0.**  
2. **Otherwise** walk the string, keep the index of the *previous* seat.  
3. Whenever we hit the *3rd, 5th, 7th‚Ä¶* seat, multiply the result by the distance between this seat and the previous seat.  
4. Return `result % 1_000_000_007`.

Why it works: every ‚Äúgap‚Äù between a pair of seats can host a divider in any of the positions that lie between the two seats. The number of possible divider positions for a particular pair is exactly the number of indices between the two seats (`i - prevSeat`). Multiplying all these independent choices yields the total number of ways.

## üöÄ Code (All 3 Languages)

### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    private static final long MOD = 1_000_000_007L;

    public int numberOfWays(String corridor) {
        long res = 1L;
        int seatCount = 0;
        int prevSeatIdx = 0;      // will be overwritten on first seat

        for (int i = 0; i < corridor.length(); i++) {
            if (corridor.charAt(i) == 'S') {
                seatCount++;

                if (seatCount > 2 && seatCount % 2 == 1) {
                    res = (res * (i - prevSeatIdx)) % MOD;
                }
                prevSeatIdx = i;
            }
        }

        if (seatCount % 2 == 1 || seatCount < 2) {
            return 0;
        }
        return (int) (res % MOD);
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    def numberOfWays(self, corridor: str) -> int:
        res = 1
        seat_cnt = 0
        prev_seat = 0

        for idx, ch in enumerate(corridor):
            if ch == 'S':
                seat_cnt += 1
                if seat_cnt > 2 and seat_cnt % 2 == 1:
                    res = (res * (idx - prev_seat)) % self.MOD
                prev_seat = idx

        return 0 if seat_cnt % 2 == 1 or seat_cnt < 2 else res % self.MOD
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfWays(string corridor) {
        const long long MOD = 1'000'000'007LL;
        long long res = 1;
        int seatCnt = 0;
        int prevSeat = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < (int)corridor.size(); ++i) {
            if (corridor[i] == 'S') {
                ++seatCnt;
                if (seatCnt > 2 && seatCnt % 2 == 1) {
                    res = (res * (i - prevSeat)) % MOD;
                }
                prevSeat = i;
            }
        }

        return (int)(res % MOD);
    }
};

## üìñ Blog Article ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of Leetcode 2147‚Äù

### Introduction
When you‚Äôre preparing for a software‚Äëengineering interview, Leetcode‚Äôs **Number of Ways to Divide a Long Corridor** (Problem‚ÄØ2147) is a classic string‚ÄëDP puzzle that seems deceptively simple at first glance. In this post, we dissect the problem from **every angle**:

| Good | Bad | Ugly |
|------|-----|------|
| **Dynamic‚ÄëProgramming** meets **combinatorics** | Edge‚Äëcase pitfalls | Misinterpreting ‚Äúgap‚Äù positions |
| **O(N)** time ‚Äì ideal for a 30‚Äëminute interview | The *odd‚Äëseat* condition can trip you up | The product of gaps can overflow if you‚Äôre not careful |

With detailed explanations, you‚Äôll know *why* the algorithm works, *what* could go wrong, and *how* to avoid common mistakes.

### 1. Problem Statement (Re‚Äëstated)
Given a string `corridor` of length **‚â§‚ÄØ10‚Åµ** that contains only `S` (seat) and `P` (person), you have two seats in a row that must form a ‚Äúblock‚Äù of exactly two seats. The goal is to place dividers between consecutive blocks of two seats such that:

* every block has exactly two seats,
* a divider can be placed in any *empty* position between two consecutive seats,
* the whole corridor is partitioned into such blocks.

Return the number of distinct divider placements modulo `10‚Åπ+7`.

---

### 2. Intuition: Why Seats Matter, Not People
If the number of seats is **odd**, it‚Äôs impossible to split the corridor into pairs of two seats‚Äîthink of trying to split 5 seats into groups of 2. That‚Äôs the **first ‚Äúugly‚Äù edge case**: forget it and you‚Äôll return a non‚Äëzero number for an impossible input.

For an **even** number of seats, you can think of the corridor as a sequence of seat positions  
`s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, s‚ÇÉ, ‚Ä¶, s‚ÇÇk`.  
Every *divider* has to sit *between* two consecutive seat positions: `s‚ÇÇ` and `s‚ÇÉ`, `s‚ÇÑ` and `s‚ÇÖ`, ‚Ä¶, `s‚ÇÇk-2` and `s‚ÇÇk-1`.  
Between two consecutive seats you can place the divider in any position that lies strictly *between* them. If the distance between the seats is `d`, there are exactly `d` valid positions.

---

### 3. The Greedy‚ÄëMultiplicative Algorithm (Good)
The elegant O(N) solution boils down to one pass:

1. Count seats (`seatCnt`).
2. Keep the index of the *previous* seat (`prevSeatIdx`).
3. When we reach seat number 3, 5, 7, ‚Ä¶ (odd seat count > 2), we multiply the answer by `i - prevSeatIdx`.

**Why?**  
The choices of divider placement for each *gap* are independent. The total number of configurations is the product of the options for each gap.

#### Proof of Correctness
- *Base*: For the first two seats there is only one way to split the corridor ‚Äì the divider is *before* seat 3, so we start `res = 1`.
- *Induction Step*: Assume we‚Äôve correctly processed the first `2t` seats (forming `t` blocks).  
  When we encounter seat `2t+1` (the start of the next block), the number of positions between seat `2t` (the last seat of block `t`) and seat `2t+1` is exactly `i - prevSeatIdx`. Multiplying by this factor preserves correctness because each new block‚Äôs placement decisions are independent of the previous ones.

By induction, after the loop finishes, `res` equals the product of all independent gap choices, i.e., the total number of divider configurations.

### 4. The ‚ÄúBad‚Äù ‚Äì Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Consequence | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Ignoring modulo** ‚Äì Using `int` for the product | Integer overflow ‚Üí Wrong answer | Use `long long` (Java `long`, Python `int` handles big ints) and apply `% MOD` each multiplication. |
| **Returning on every seat** ‚Äì `prevSeat` uninitialized | Wrong distance on first odd seat | Initialize `prevSeat` only after encountering the first seat, or set a dummy value that is overwritten on the first seat. |
| **Checking `seatCnt > 1` instead of `seatCnt >= 2`** | Mis‚Äëcounts when corridor has exactly 2 seats but no dividers | The answer is 1 (only the initial divider) when `seatCnt == 2`. Ensure `seatCnt >= 2` before returning non‚Äëzero. |
| **Off‚Äëby‚Äëone in the distance** | Counting `i - prevSeat` when `prevSeat` is the *first* seat for the third seat instead of the second | In the provided algorithm `prevSeat` is updated after every seat, so when seat #3 is processed it holds seat #2‚Äôs index, giving the correct distance. |
| **Not handling odd seat count** | Returning a positive number for impossible inputs | Add a final check: if `seatCnt % 2 == 1` ‚Üí return 0. |

---

### 5. The ‚ÄúUgly‚Äù ‚Äì Alternative Na√Øve Approaches (and Why They Fail)

| Approach | Complexity | Why It Fails |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Brute‚Äëforce all divider placements** ‚Äì DFS/Backtracking | O(2‚Åø) | Exponential time, impossible for `n = 10‚Åµ`. |
| **Dynamic programming with state** ‚Äì `dp[i][j]` (positions, parity) | O(n¬≤) memory | Too large for 10‚Åµ. |
| **Divide & Conquer by splitting on the first odd seat** | O(n log n) if not careful | Still too slow for worst case. |

These ‚Äúugly‚Äù solutions are a reminder that **over‚Äëengineering** can kill your runtime on Leetcode. The product‚Äëof‚Äëgaps trick is the cleanest, fastest, and most interview‚Äëfriendly.

### 6. Tips for the Interview

1. **Read the constraints carefully.**  
   *String length up to 10‚Åµ ‚Üí O(N) is mandatory.*  
2. **Explain the intuition first.**  
   ‚ÄúThe number of divider positions between two seats is simply the distance between them.‚Äù  
3. **State the algorithm step‚Äëby‚Äëstep.**  
   This demonstrates that you can translate intuition into a concrete plan.  
4. **Mention the modulo.**  
   Leetcode always asks for modulo 1‚ÄØ000‚ÄØ000‚ÄØ007; forgetting to take `% MOD` can trip the judge.  
5. **Test edge cases yourself.**  
   ```text
   ""          ‚Üí 0
   "S"         ‚Üí 0
   "SS"        ‚Üí 1
   "SPSPSS"    ‚Üí 0  (odd seats)
   "SSPSPSS"   ‚Üí 2
   ```
   Show that your code passes these.

### üéâ Conclusion

The ‚ÄúNumber of Ways to Divide a Long Corridor‚Äù problem is a shining example of **O(N) cleverness** hidden behind a seemingly complicated statement.  
- The *good* is its linear solution‚Äîjust one scan, one multiplication per odd seat.  
- The *bad* is that a single oversight (odd seat count or forgetting modulo) instantly invalidates the whole answer.  
- The *ugly* lies in the temptation to over‚Äëcomplicate with DP or backtracking; the simple math is the key.

If you‚Äôre tackling your next coding interview, remember: *look for independent choices*, *reduce the problem to a product of gaps*, and *apply modulo early and often*.  

Happy coding! üöÄ
