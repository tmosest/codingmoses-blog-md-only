        ## üöÄ LeetCode 2163 ‚Äì Minimum Difference in Sums After Removal of Elements  
**Solution in Java, Python & C++**  
**Blog Post:** *The Good, the Bad & the Ugly ‚Äì How to Nail This Interview Problem (and Land Your Dream Job)*

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Summary  
Given a 0‚Äëindexed array `nums` of length `3 * n`, we must **remove exactly `n` elements**.  
The remaining `2n` elements are split into two equal parts:

```
left part  ‚Äì first  n elements  ‚Üí  sumFirst
right part ‚Äì next   n elements  ‚Üí  sumSecond
```

Return the **minimum possible value** of `sumFirst ‚Äì sumSecond`.

> **Constraints**  
> * `1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`  
> * `1 ‚â§ nums[i] ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`  
> * `nums.length == 3*n`

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ High‚ÄëLevel Idea  
We can think of the array as **three contiguous blocks**:

```
[  left  ] [ middle ] [ right ]
```

* In the *left* block we want to keep the **smallest** `n` numbers ‚Äì they will become part of `sumFirst`.
* In the *right* block we want to keep the **largest** `n` numbers ‚Äì they will become part of `sumSecond`.

The challenge is to decide **where to cut** the array into `[0 ‚Ä¶ i]` and `[i+1 ‚Ä¶ 3n-1]` so that the difference of the two sums is minimal.

### Strategy
1. **Left prefix** ‚Äì for every possible cut point `i` (after at least `n` elements and before the last `n`), compute the sum of the *n smallest* numbers in `nums[0 ‚Ä¶ i]`.  
   *Maintain* these sums using a **max‚Äëheap** (priority queue) that stores the current `n` smallest values.  
2. **Right suffix** ‚Äì similarly, for every cut point `i`, compute the sum of the *n largest* numbers in `nums[i+1 ‚Ä¶ 3n-1]`.  
   *Maintain* these sums using a **min‚Äëheap** that stores the current `n` largest values.
3. The answer for a cut at position `i` is `leftSum[i] ‚Äì rightSum[i+1]`.  
   Scan all valid `i` and keep the minimum.

**Time Complexity** ‚Äì `O(n log n)` (heap operations).  
**Space Complexity** ‚Äì `O(n)` for the two auxiliary arrays plus heaps.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction  

When recruiters ask ‚Äú**What‚Äôs your most challenging LeetCode problem**?‚Äù, they‚Äôre not just looking for a correct answer; they want to see **clean code, clever use of data structures, and a solid explanation**.  
LeetCode 2163 ‚Äì *Minimum Difference in Sums After Removal of Elements* ‚Äì is a prime candidate because it blends **dynamic programming** with **priority queues**.  
In this post we‚Äôll walk through the *good* (efficient & elegant), the *bad* (tricky edge‚Äëcases), and the *ugly* (index gymnastics) aspects of the problem, then present reference solutions in **Java, Python, and C++**.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Recap (in Interview Style)

> **Prompt**  
> *You have an array of size 3‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØn. Remove exactly n elements. The remaining 2n elements are split into a left and right half. Return the minimal possible value of sum(left) ‚Äì sum(right).*

**Why is it interesting?**  
* It‚Äôs a ‚Äúpartition after removing‚Äù puzzle ‚Äì many candidates solve it naively with `O(n¬≥)` enumeration, which times out.  
* The optimal solution demonstrates mastery of **heaps** (priority queues) ‚Äì a staple in many interview questions.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Good ‚Äì What Works

| Feature | What it Means | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **O(n‚ÄØlog‚ÄØn) time** | Each heap operation costs log‚ÄØn, performed 2‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØn times | Scales to the maximum `n = 10‚Åµ`. |
| **Simple Data Structures** | Only two priority queues + two O(n) arrays | Clear, maintainable code that avoids complex DP tables. |
| **Deterministic Output** | Uses long/64‚Äëbit sums to avoid overflow | Safeguards against hidden test cases with large values. |
| **Cross‚ÄëLanguage Consistency** | Same algorithm in Java, Python, C++ | Shows language‚Äëagnostic thinking ‚Äì a plus in coding interviews. |

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ The Bad ‚Äì Things That Go Wrong

1. **Off‚Äëby‚ÄëOne Errors**  
   * The cut point must leave at least `n` elements on each side (`i` from `n-1` to `3n-n-1`).  
   * Forgetting this leads to `ArrayIndexOutOfBounds` or wrong results.
2. **Heap Size Management**  
   * Replacing the *largest* element in a max‚Äëheap or the *smallest* element in a min‚Äëheap is easy in theory but easy to get reversed in practice.  
   * In Python, negative numbers emulate a max‚Äëheap ‚Äì a common source of bugs.
3. **Overflow**  
   * `sumFirst` and `sumSecond` can each reach `n * 10‚Åµ` (‚âà‚ÄØ10¬π‚Å∞), which fits in 32‚Äëbit signed int only by luck.  
   * Use 64‚Äëbit (`long`/`long long`) for intermediate sums.
4. **Memory Footprint**  
   * Storing two `O(3n)` arrays may be overlooked; at `n = 10‚Åµ`, this is ~‚ÄØ2‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ3‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚Åµ‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ8‚ÄØbytes ‚âà‚ÄØ4‚ÄØMB ‚Äì still fine, but mention it in the explanation.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ The Ugly ‚Äì Hidden Edge Cases

| Scenario | Why It‚Äôs Ugly | How to Fix |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| **All numbers equal** | The algorithm still works, but it feels ‚Äútoo easy‚Äù and can distract from more interesting parts of the interview. | Show the candidate can adapt the solution for this degenerate case quickly. |
| **Negative Numbers (not in constraints)** | If constraints change to allow negatives, the heap logic breaks (e.g., `n` smallest might be negative). | Ask the interviewer if they want to support negatives; if yes, adjust the heap comparisons accordingly. |
| **Large input size (n = 10‚Åµ)** | Recursion or naive loops may hit stack limits or timeouts. | Use iterative loops and pre‚Äëallocate arrays; test with a big random case. |
| **Non‚Äëcontiguous cut** | The problem explicitly requires contiguous halves, but a candidate might mistakenly think they can reorder the array. | Clarify the ‚Äúsplit into two halves‚Äù requirement early in the conversation. |

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Interviewer Perspective  

| Question | Why They Ask | Your Talking Points |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| *Explain the algorithm and why heaps work.* | Tests understanding of ‚Äúselect the k smallest / largest‚Äù. | Mention that a max‚Äëheap keeps the `k` smallest and a min‚Äëheap keeps the `k` largest. |
| *Can you reduce the time complexity further?* | Checking if an O(n) or O(n‚ÄØlog‚ÄØn) solution is optimal. | Show that `O(n)` is impossible because you must inspect each element at least once, and `O(n log n)` is optimal with heaps. |
| *What if the values were larger than 32‚Äëbit?* | Testing handling of overflow. | Emphasize using 64‚Äëbit integers for sums. |
| *Can you write this in another language?* | Gauging cross‚Äëlanguage fluency. | Present the Java, Python, C++ snippets and discuss any language‚Äëspecific nuances. |

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ How to Impress in Your Interview

1. **Start with a Clear Plan**  
   * ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to use two heaps: a max‚Äëheap for the left side and a min‚Äëheap for the right side.‚Äù  
   * Write the plan on a whiteboard before coding.
2. **Explain the Heaps**  
   * ‚ÄúThe max‚Äëheap always contains the current `n` smallest values in the prefix. If a new element is smaller than the heap‚Äôs maximum, we pop and push.‚Äù  
   * ‚ÄúThe min‚Äëheap keeps the `n` largest values in the suffix.‚Äù
3. **Show the Cut‚ÄëPoint Loop**  
   * ‚ÄúWe slide a window over the valid cut points and compute the difference in O(1) per step.‚Äù
4. **Time & Space Analysis**  
   * ‚Äú`O(n log n)` time due to heap operations; `O(n)` auxiliary space.‚Äù
5. **Edge Cases**  
   * ‚ÄúWe use `long` to avoid overflow. If values could be negative, we‚Äôd adjust the comparison logic.‚Äù
6. **Clean Code**  
   * Keep variable names descriptive (`leftSum`, `rightSum`, `cut`).  
   * Use pre‚Äëallocation (`vector<long long> left(n*3)` in C++).

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Takeaway

LeetCode‚ÄØ2163 is not just another puzzle ‚Äì it‚Äôs a **showcase of algorithmic thinking**.  
By mastering the *good* (efficient heaps), avoiding the *bad* (off‚Äëby‚Äëones & overflow), and navigating the *ugly* (edge cases), you‚Äôll demonstrate a deep understanding that recruiters value.  
Use the reference solutions in **Java, Python, and C++** as a benchmark and practice explaining them out loud ‚Äì that‚Äôs your fastest path to the ‚Äúhire‚Äù button.

### üöÄ Final Words

- *Code first, explain later.*  
- *When in doubt, ask clarifying questions ‚Äì it shows you‚Äôre thoughtful, not careless.*  
- *Practice writing the same solution in three languages ‚Äì it proves versatility.*

Good luck, and may the heap be with you! üöÄ

### üìå Note for Recruiters

When reviewing a candidate‚Äôs solution to LeetCode‚ÄØ2163, focus not only on correctness but also on:

* **Algorithmic Clarity** ‚Äì Did they articulate the heap strategy?  
* **Handling of Constraints** ‚Äì Did they use 64‚Äëbit sums?  
* **Code Readability** ‚Äì Are variable names descriptive?  
* **Cross‚ÄëLanguage Proficiency** ‚Äì Did they present Java, Python, and C++ solutions?  

If a candidate checks all of the above, they‚Äôre a strong contender for any software engineering role.
