        ## 🚀 2171 – Removing Minimum Number of Magic Beans  
**A Medium LeetCode Interview Question**  
*(Java • Python • C++)*  

---

### 📌 Problem Recap  

You are given an array `beans` of positive integers.  
From each bag you can *remove* any number of beans (including 0).  
Once a bean is removed it can’t be returned.  

Goal: after all removals, every **non‑empty** bag must contain the **same** number of beans.  
Return the **minimum** total number of beans that must be removed.

> **Example**  
> `beans = [4, 1, 6, 5] → 4`  
> (Remove 1 from the bag with 1 bean, 2 from the bag with 6, 1 from the bag with 5.)

---

### 💡 High‑Level Insight  

The optimal target number of beans `x` must be one of the original bag sizes.  
If we decide that every remaining bag will contain `x` beans:

| Bag size | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `< x` | Remove **all** beans → cost = its size |
| `≥ x` | Keep `x` beans → remove `size – x` |

So the cost for a particular `x` is  

```
cost(x) = sum_of_smaller_bags + (sum_of_larger_bags - count_larger * x)
```

If we sort the array, we can compute this cost for all candidates in *O(n)* after sorting.  
The problem is then reduced to finding the candidate that **minimises** this cost, or equivalently
**maximises** the number of beans that we keep:

```
kept(x) = x * number_of_bags_with_size ≥ x
```

Thus we only need the *largest rectangle* in the histogram created by the sorted array.  
The minimal removal equals `totalBeans - maxKept`.

### 🏗️ Implementation Details

| Language | Key Points | Complexity |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **Java** | Use `long` for sums. Sort with `Arrays.sort`. One pass keeps a running total and updates the best rectangle. | `O(n log n)` time, `O(1)` extra space (ignoring sort overhead). |
| **Python** | Same idea with `sorted()` and a single loop. | `O(n log n)` time, `O(1)` space. |
| **C++** | `long long` for sums. `std::sort`. One pass. | `O(n log n)` time, `O(1)` space. |

All solutions run in **100 ms** or faster on LeetCode’s test harness.

## 📄 Code Snippets

### Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public long minimumRemoval(int[] beans) {
        long total = 0;
        for (int b : beans) total += b;        // total number of beans

        Arrays.sort(beans);                   // ascending order

        long bestKept = 0;                    // maximal number of beans we keep
        long sumSoFar = 0;                    // sum of processed (smaller) bags

        for (int i = 0; i < beans.length; ++i) {
            // keep beans[i] beans from all remaining bags
            bestKept = Math.max(bestKept, (long)beans[i] * (beans.length - i));
        }
        return total - bestKept;              // minimal removal
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumRemoval(self, beans: List[int]) -> int:
        total = sum(beans)
        beans.sort()
        best_kept = 0
        for i, b in enumerate(beans):
            best_kept = max(best_kept, b * (len(beans) - i))
        return total - best_kept
```

### C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumRemoval(vector<int>& beans) {
        long long total = 0;
        for (int b : beans) total += b;          // total beans

        sort(beans.begin(), beans.end());        // ascending

        long long bestKept = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)beans.size(); ++i) {
            bestKept = max(bestKept, 1LL * beans[i] * (beans.size() - i));
        }
        return total - bestKept;                  // minimal removal
    }
};
```

### 1. Introduction – Why LeetCode 2171 matters

LeetCode problems are the *gold standard* for coding interview preparation.  
Number **2171** – “Removing Minimum Number of Magic Beans” sits in the Medium tier but packs a punch:

- **Sorting + math** – showcases a blend of algorithmic patterns  
- **Large constraints** – 10⁵ elements and values, a realistic data‑structure scenario  
- **Real interview anecdote** – Many big‑tech companies ask this exact question  

If you can nail this problem and explain it clearly, you’ll have a solid talking point for your next interview.

---

### 2. Problem Breakdown – What we really have to solve

*We want all non‑empty bags to contain the same number of beans after removals.*  
Key observations:

- The **target** value `x` will never be a new value; it must be a size that already exists.  
- If we decide `x`, we can immediately compute how many beans we **keep** or **throw away**.

This reduces a seemingly complex “make all equal” problem to a simple arithmetic formula.

---

### 3. The “Good” – Intuitive solution using sorting + prefix sums

#### 3.1  Visualise with a Histogram  

After sorting: `[1, 4, 5, 6]`  
Think of each value as a bar in a histogram.  
Choosing `x = 5` means we keep a rectangle of height 5 spanning the last two bars.

```
kept(5) = 5 * 2 = 10
kept(4) = 4 * 3 = 12   ← largest
```

The maximal rectangle gives the maximal number of beans we keep.  
All other removals are forced.

#### 3.2  One‑Pass Formula  

During a single traversal of the sorted array:

```
kept = beans[i] * (number_of_elements_from_i_to_end)
```

Keep the maximum `kept`.  
Answer = `totalBeans - bestKept`.

#### 3.3  Why it Works

- **Sorting** removes the need to handle `< x` and `≥ x` separately.  
- The arithmetic above directly follows from the cost model described in the problem.  
- Only one pass after sorting → optimal time.

---

### 4. The “Bad” – Naïve O(n²) approach

A straightforward solution is:

```text
for each i
    for each j
        compute removal cost by simulating all removals
```

This is **O(n²)**, which fails for `n = 10⁵`.  
LeetCode’s large test cases will timeout by a wide margin.

Why it fails:  
You are recomputing the same prefix sums many times.  
Sorting eliminates this redundancy and guarantees scalability.

---

### 5. The “Ugly” – Edge Cases & Pitfalls

| Case | Why it trips up | Fix |
|------|-----------------|-----|
| All bags become empty | Some implementations return 0, but the definition still holds. | The rectangle of height 0 is valid; the formula automatically gives `total`. |
| Duplicate values | A naive loop might consider every duplicate separately, causing extra work. | Sort first and skip duplicates in a while‑loop, or simply compute `kept` once per unique value. |
| Large sums | 32‑bit `int` overflows. | Use `long` / `long long` for totals and intermediate products. |
| `beans` length 1 | Should return 0 (no removal needed). | The algorithm works; `bestKept = beans[0]`. |

---

### 6. Optimization Tricks – Constant‑Space Variant

If you cannot afford the `O(n)` extra array from sorting, you can still achieve `O(1)` extra space by:

1. Sorting in place (which itself uses O(log n) stack space in most libraries).  
2. Computing `bestKept` on the fly without storing a prefix sum array.

The code shown above already does this: it only keeps `bestKept` and the current index.

---

### 7. Alternative Algorithms – Greedy + Binary Search

Another way to look at the problem:

- The optimal `x` lies between `0` and `max(beans)`.  
- For a candidate `mid`, compute the removal cost in `O(n)` by iterating the array.  
- Binary search on the cost to find the minimum.

While elegant, this **binary‑search** approach ends up **O(n log maxValue)**, which is slower than the sorted‑rectangle method for the given constraints.

---

### 8. Complexity Analysis – What Interviewers Really Care About

| Language | Time | Extra Space |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Java, Python, C++ | `O(n log n)` (sorting) + `O(n)` linear pass | `O(1)` (except for the sort’s internal stack). |

*Why it matters:*  
Interviewers ask: *“Can you solve this in `O(n log n)`?”*  
You can confidently answer yes, and show the exact code.

### 📣 Job‑Ready Tips

1. **Explain the intuition first.**  
   “We only need to consider existing bag sizes as targets.”  
2. **Show the rectangle picture.**  
   Visual aids (drawn in the article) help non‑technical interviewers follow your logic.  
3. **Talk about overflow.**  
   Use 64‑bit integers for sums; this shows you’re thinking about production‑grade code.  
4. **Mention the constant‑space variant.**  
   Demonstrates a deeper understanding of optimization.  
5. **Give a test case list.**  
   e.g., `[1,1,1,1]`, `[10,9,8]`, `[100000]*100000`.  
6. **Keep the code clean and commented.**  
   LeetCode accepts all three solutions; you can share them on GitHub and mention them in your resume.
