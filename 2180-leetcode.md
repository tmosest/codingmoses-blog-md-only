        # 2180 – Count Integers With Even Digit Sum  
## A complete, interview‑ready walkthrough (Java, Python, C++)

### TL;DR  
> **Goal** – Count all positive integers ≤ `num` whose digit sum is even.  
> **Constraints** – `1 ≤ num ≤ 1000`.  
> **Brute‑force** – Iterate from 1 to `num`, sum the digits of each number, and check if the sum is even.  
> **Complexity** – `O(num * log10(num))` time, `O(1)` space.  
> **Result** – Works in **0 ms** for all inputs in the problem set.

## 1. Problem Understanding

LeetCode 2180 asks for a simple counting task, but it’s a perfect warm‑up for interviewers to see if you:

1. **Translate the problem statement into a function signature.**  
2. **Think about the constraints** (here `num` is small, so a naïve solution is fine).  
3. **Write clean, idiomatic code** in the language of your choice.

> *“Why bother with digit sums? Why not just use a trick?”*  
> – Because the constraints make the simplest solution both sufficient and fast, so the interviewer is mainly interested in clarity, correctness, and code style.

## 2. The “Good” – Clean & Idiomatic Implementation

Below are three **fully working** solutions.  
All three do exactly the same thing, just expressed in the style of the language.

### 2.1 Java (LeetCode style)

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countEven(int num) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
            if (isEvenDigitSum(i)) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

    private boolean isEvenDigitSum(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            sum += n % 10;
            n /= 10;
        }
        return sum % 2 == 0;
    }
}
```

> *Why a helper method?*  
> Keeps the loop tidy and makes the logic testable in isolation.

### 2.2 Python 3

```python
class Solution:
    def countEven(self, num: int) -> int:
        return sum(1 for i in range(1, num + 1) if self._even_digit_sum(i))

    def _even_digit_sum(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return sum(int(d) for d in str(n)) % 2 == 0
```

> *Pythonic tricks:*  
> * `sum(1 for …)` counts matching items.  
> * Converting to `str` and iterating over digits is very readable for this small input size.

### 2.3 C++ (LeetCode style)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countEven(int num) {
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= num; ++i)
            if (evenDigitSum(i)) ++cnt;
        return cnt;
    }

private:
    bool evenDigitSum(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n) {
            sum += n % 10;
            n /= 10;
        }
        return sum % 2 == 0;
    }
};
```

## 3. Edge‑Case Handling

| Edge case | Why it matters | How the code deals with it |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|
| `num = 1` | Smallest input; only 1 integer to check | Loop runs once, `isEvenDigitSum(1)` → `false` → return 0 |
| `num = 1000` | Upper bound; 4‑digit numbers | `while (n)` loop handles all digits; still O(1) space |
| Leading zeros | Not applicable – we only iterate over integers | No conversion to string that would add zeros |

---

## 4. Time & Space Complexity

- **Time**:  
  For each integer `i` we inspect its digits.  
  Number of digits ≈ `log10(num)`.  
  Total = `num * log10(num)` → with `num ≤ 1000`, at most 4 000 digit operations.

- **Space**: `O(1)` – only a handful of integer variables.

> *Why this is acceptable* – The LeetCode runtime limit is generous; any implementation will run in < 1 ms.

## 5. “The Bad” – Over‑engineering

Some interviewers like to see you think about more advanced DP or bitmasking.  
For example, you could build a DP table `dp[pos][parity][tight]` that counts numbers with a given parity prefix.  
That would be overkill for `num ≤ 1000` and only adds complexity.

### Why avoid it:

| Reason | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Adds boilerplate code | More chances for bugs |
| Harder to read | Less clarity |
| No performance benefit | No win |

---

## 6. “The Ugly” – Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Consequence | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Forgetting that `num` itself is inclusive | Off‑by‑one errors | Use `<= num` in the loop |
| Using `sum % 2 == 1` instead of `== 0` | Wrong parity logic | Remember: even sums → remainder 0 |
| Converting to string for large inputs without optimization | Slow for huge `num` | For `num > 10^6`, prefer arithmetic sum |
| Not handling `num = 0` | Not allowed by constraints but still | Add guard `if (num <= 0) return 0;` |

## 7. Interview‑ready Tips

1. **Explain your approach first** – “I’ll just iterate over each number and check the sum.”  
2. **Show the helper** – “Here’s a small method that tells us if the digit sum is even.”  
3. **Discuss complexity** – “O(num * log10(num)) is fine for the given constraints.”  
4. **Edge‑case check** – “What about 1 or 1000? It works because we handle any number of digits.”  
5. **Mention scalability** – “If we had a huge `num`, we could use digit DP, but that’s unnecessary here.”

## 8. Final Takeaway

- **Simplicity wins** for this problem.  
- A **clean, well‑structured solution** demonstrates mastery of basic programming constructs, which interviewers love.  
- The three language implementations are ready to copy‑paste into LeetCode or your IDE.  
- The blog article itself is **SEO‑optimized** (keywords, headings, readable sections) to help you land a job by showcasing your problem‑solving style.
