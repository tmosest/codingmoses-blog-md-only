## 1.  LeetCode 2190 – **Most Frequent Number Following Key in an Array**

| Language | Code |
|----------|------|
| **Java** | ```java
public class Solution {
    public int mostFrequent(int[] nums, int key) {
        // HashMap to keep counts of each value that follows `key`
        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();

        // Traverse the array and count only the numbers that appear after `key`
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == key) {
                freq.merge(nums[i + 1], 1, Integer::sum);
            }
        }

        // Find the number with the maximum count
        int best = -1;
        int bestCnt = -1;
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> e : freq.entrySet()) {
            if (e.getValue() > bestCnt) {
                bestCnt = e.getValue();
                best = e.getKey();
            }
        }
        return best;   // guaranteed to be unique
    }
}
``` |
| **Python** | ```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def mostFrequent(self, nums: List[int], key: int) -> int:
        freq = Counter()
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            if nums[i] == key:
                freq[nums[i + 1]] += 1
        # `most_common(1)` returns a list of the most common element
        return freq.most_common(1)[0][0]
``` |
| **C++** | ```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int mostFrequent(vector<int>& nums, int key) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        for (size_t i = 0; i + 1 < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == key) {
                ++freq[nums[i + 1]];
            }
        }
        int best = -1, bestCnt = -1;
        for (const auto& kv : freq) {
            if (kv.second > bestCnt) {
                bestCnt = kv.second;
                best = kv.first;
            }
        }
        return best;   // guaranteed unique
    }
};

> **Why a hash map?**  
> The problem asks for a frequency count of *values that immediately follow* a particular key.  
> A hash‑map (`O(1)` average insert/lookup) gives us the most direct way to keep a running tally for each candidate number.  
> With only up to 1 000 elements (per the constraints) and values bounded to 1 000, the map stays tiny, so the approach is both time‑ and space‑efficient.

## 2.  Blog Article – “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of LeetCode 2190”

### Title
**Mastering LeetCode 2190: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly – A Complete Interview Guide**

### Introduction

If you’re preparing for a software‑engineering interview, you’ll often encounter “frequency‑count” problems that sound simple at first glance but can trip you up if you overlook edge‑cases.  
LeetCode’s *2190 – Most Frequent Number Following Key in an Array* is a perfect example. In this article, we’ll:

- Walk through the problem statement and constraints.
- Present a clean, production‑ready solution in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.
- Highlight the *good* (clear, efficient, easy to understand), the *bad* (possible pitfalls), and the *ugly* (common mistakes, confusing test cases).
- Give you actionable take‑aways to ace this question and similar interview problems.

---

### Problem Recap

> **Given** a 0‑indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `key` that is guaranteed to exist in `nums`.  
> **Task**: For every unique integer `target` that appears *immediately after* an occurrence of `key`, count how many times this happens. Return the `target` with the maximum count. The answer will always be unique.

> **Constraints**

| Parameter | Range |
|-----------|-------|
| `nums.length` | 2 – 1 000 |
| `nums[i]` | 1 – 1 000 |
| `key` | present in `nums` |

> **Example**  
> `nums = [1,100,200,1,100]`, `key = 1` → **Output**: `100` (it follows `1` twice).

---

### The Good: Why This Approach is Elegant

1. **Linear Time** – A single pass over the array (`O(n)`) is all we need.
2. **Constant Extra Space** – The hash map grows only up to the number of distinct values that follow `key` (≤ 1 000).  
3. **Clarity** – The algorithm reads like plain English: “Count each follower; pick the most frequent.”
4. **Language‑Agility** – The same logic translates to Java, Python, C++ with minimal boilerplate.

---

### The Bad: Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Explanation | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Skipping the last element** | Since we look at `i + 1`, the final index is never checked. | Iterate only to `nums.length - 1`. |
| **Assuming the key appears only once** | If `key` occurs multiple times, all followers must be counted. | Keep counting inside the loop without resetting. |
| **Using an array for counts (size 1000)** | Works but wastes memory and can be error‑prone if the range changes. | Use a dynamic map (`HashMap`, `unordered_map`, `Counter`). |
| **Confusing the answer with the key itself** | If `key` appears twice in a row, the key itself can be a valid follower. | Treat `key` like any other follower; nothing special. |
| **Returning 0 or -1 when map is empty** | The problem guarantees `key` exists, but if `key` is at the very end, the map would be empty. | Handle this corner case explicitly (though with the constraints this situation never arises). |

---

### The Ugly: Trick Test Cases & Edge‑Cases

1. **All Elements Are the Key**  
   ```text
   nums = [5,5,5,5,5], key = 5
   ```
   *Answer*: `5` (the key follows itself 4 times).  
   *Why it matters*: Some naive solutions forget that the follower can equal the key.

2. **Key at the End**  
   ```text
   nums = [1,2,3,4], key = 4
   ```
   *Answer*: No follower exists – but the problem guarantees the answer is unique, so this input won’t appear.  
   *Takeaway*: Always guard against `i+1` out‑of‑bounds.

3. **Large Frequency Count**  
   ```text
   nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2], key = 1
   ```
   *Answer*: `2` (count = 4).  
   *Why it matters*: Confirms that we’re counting occurrences, not just distinct values.

4. **Multiple Candidates with Same Frequency (contrary to guarantee)**  
   Although LeetCode ensures uniqueness, writing code that handles ties gracefully (e.g., by choosing the smallest or first seen) shows robustness.

---

### Step‑by‑Step Walk‑Through (Java)

1. **Create a `HashMap<Integer,Integer>`** – key = follower, value = count.
2. **Single loop** – For `i = 0` to `len-2`:
   - If `nums[i] == key`, increment `freq[nums[i+1]]`.
3. **Find maximum** – Iterate over the map entries; track the largest count and corresponding follower.
4. **Return** – That follower is guaranteed unique.

**Code**  
*(See section 1 – Java)*

---

### Step‑by‑Step Walk‑Through (Python)

Python’s `collections.Counter` makes counting trivial:

```python
from collections import Counter

for i, val in enumerate(nums[:-1]):   # avoid last element
    if val == key:
        counter[nums[i+1]] += 1

return counter.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

`most_common(1)` guarantees the top element; no need for manual comparison.

---

### Step‑by‑Step Walk‑Through (C++)

Use `unordered_map<int,int>`:

```cpp
unordered_map<int,int> freq;
for (size_t i = 0; i + 1 < nums.size(); ++i) {
    if (nums[i] == key) freq[nums[i+1]]++;
}
int best = -1, bestCnt = -1;
for (auto &p : freq) {
    if (p.second > bestCnt) { bestCnt = p.second; best = p.first; }
}
return best;
```

---

### Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Java/Python/C++ |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Time** | `O(n)` – one pass + O(k) to find max (`k` = distinct followers ≤ 1 000). |
| **Space** | `O(k)` – map of distinct followers. |

---

### Take‑Away Tips for Interviews

1. **Clarify the question** – Ask if followers can equal the key, confirm constraints.  
2. **Explain your algorithm** – Mention linear time, hash map usage, why you don’t need nested loops.  
3. **Edge‑case awareness** – Discuss the “key at end” and “all keys” scenarios.  
4. **Show robustness** – Even though the answer is unique, show how your code would behave if ties appeared.  
5. **Language‑specific strengths** – In Python, highlight `Counter`; in C++, emphasize `unordered_map`; in Java, note `merge` or `compute`.

### Final Thought

LeetCode 2190 is a micro‑test of both your data‑structure knowledge and your ability to reason about frequency in a constrained domain.  
By mastering its “good, bad, ugly” aspects, you’ll not only solve this exact problem with confidence but also build a framework that applies to countless other interview questions.

Happy coding—and may your interviews be filled with *clear* solutions and *smooth* execution! 🚀
