# Upgrading Bezalel... 

Finally got all the [parts](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4975346) we need... God this print was a beast... 

Just need to take some things apart now...

Screws... screws... screws... and a bad quality print but we got it attached!!!

Also replaced the fan that was inside that powerbox with a larger one that cools off the entire bottom but now we need some new feet...

Ok, that is getting much closer to functional. I propped it up on some old printer cases for now and it homes fine but halted when trying to set the z offset. 

Need to investigate further into what I did wrong.
But I am going to time box this for now.

Celebrimbor is still working great. However this one raspberry pi case refuses to print correctly so we are gonna move on from that as well and print some feet...
Cause feet pics are where the money is at... You can find me on only fans if this doesn't work out as Big Foot.
