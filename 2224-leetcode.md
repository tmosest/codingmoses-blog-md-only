        ## 1.  Code Solutions  

Below are clean, production‑ready implementations of **LeetCode 2224 – Minimum Number of Operations to Convert Time** in **Java, Python, and C++**.  
Each solution follows the same greedy strategy: convert both strings to minutes and repeatedly subtract the largest possible increment (60 → 15 → 5 → 1) until the `current` time matches `correct`.  
The time complexity is **O(1)** (the loop runs at most a few dozen iterations) and the space complexity is **O(1)**.

### 1.1 Java – `Solution.java`

```java
// 2025‑09‑23  –  LeetCode 2224
// O(1) time & space – greedy greedy
public class Solution {
    public int convertTime(String current, String correct) {
        int cur = toMinutes(current);
        int target = toMinutes(correct);
        int ops = 0;
        int[] inc = {60, 15, 5, 1};

        for (int d : inc) {
            ops += (target - cur) / d;
            cur += ((target - cur) / d) * d;
        }
        return ops;
    }

    private int toMinutes(String t) {
        String[] parts = t.split(":");
        return Integer.parseInt(parts[0]) * 60 + Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
    }
}
```

### 1.2 Python – `solution.py`

```python
# 2025‑09‑23 – LeetCode 2224
# O(1) solution with greedy subtraction

def convert_time(current: str, correct: str) -> int:
    cur = _to_minutes(current)
    target = _to_minutes(correct)

    ops = 0
    for inc in (60, 15, 5, 1):
        delta = target - cur
        ops += delta // inc
        cur += (delta // inc) * inc
    return ops

def _to_minutes(t: str) -> int:
    h, m = map(int, t.split(":"))
    return h * 60 + m
```

---

### 1.3 C++ – `solution.cpp`

```cpp
// 2025‑09‑23 – LeetCode 2224
// Greedy, O(1) time, O(1) space

#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int convertTime(string current, string correct) {
        int cur = toMinutes(current);
        int target = toMinutes(correct);
        int ops = 0;
        vector<int> inc = {60, 15, 5, 1};

        for (int d : inc) {
            int delta = target - cur;
            ops += delta / d;
            cur += (delta / d) * d;
        }
        return ops;
    }

private:
    int toMinutes(const string &t) {
        int h = stoi(t.substr(0, 2));
        int m = stoi(t.substr(3, 2));
        return h * 60 + m;
    }
};
```

### 2.1 Introduction

In the world of coding interviews, the **LeetCode 2224** problem – *Minimum Number of Operations to Convert Time* – is a classic example of how a seemingly simple question can test your grasp of **greedy algorithms**, **time‑complexity analysis**, and **corner‑case awareness**.  

Whether you’re a junior developer or a seasoned engineer, cracking this problem not only demonstrates algorithmic fluency but also showcases your ability to write clean, production‑grade code in multiple languages. Below we’ll walk through the **good** (why it’s a valuable interview exercise), the **bad** (common pitfalls and why naive solutions fail), and the **ugly** (the subtle traps that trip even experienced candidates).

---

### 2.2 The Good – Why This Problem Matters

| Benefit | Why It Helps in Interviews |
|---------|----------------------------|
| **Greedy Insight** | The problem forces you to think in terms of “take the biggest step possible.” This is a hallmark of many interview questions. |
| **Constant‑Time Reasoning** | You need to prove that the solution runs in *O(1)*, not *O(n)*. Understanding why a constant number of iterations suffices is crucial for algorithmic rigor. |
| **Multilingual Implementation** | Demonstrating the same logic in **Java, Python, and C++** shows versatility—something recruiters love. |
| **Edge‑Case Awareness** | Times at the boundary (e.g., 23:59 to 23:59) or minimal increments (1 minute) test your ability to handle edge cases correctly. |
| **Clear Code Style** | The solution’s brevity (often under 10 lines) highlights clean code practices and reduces bugs. |

---

### 2.3 The Bad – Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| **Simulating every minute** | Looping minute‑by‑minute leads to *O(Δt)* time, which is unnecessary and slow for large time differences. |
| **Using floating‑point or modulo tricks** | Relying on division or modulus can introduce off‑by‑one errors if the remainder is not handled correctly. |
| **Hard‑coding increments in reverse order** | Some candidates start with 1 min and add, which works but is less efficient and harder to justify. |
| **Ignoring the “current <= correct” guarantee** | Assuming that current can be larger than correct may lead to infinite loops or wrong answers. |

---

### 2.4 The Ugly – Tricky Edge Cases

1. **Zero Difference**  
   *Input*: `current = "12:00"`, `correct = "12:00"` → Answer: `0`  
   Forgetting to handle this case can cause division by zero or extra iterations.

2. **Large Differences Crossing Hours**  
   *Input*: `current = "00:00"`, `correct = "23:59"` → Must use 23 full 60‑min increments and then the remaining minutes.

3. **Trailing Zeros in Strings**  
   `current = "04:05"` → Ensure the `split` or substring logic handles leading zeros correctly.

4. **Locale‑Dependent Time Formats**  
   Some languages (e.g., Java’s `DateTimeFormatter`) may parse `"HH:mm"` differently if the locale is set to something else. Always use explicit parsing.

---

### 2.5 Step‑by‑Step Solution

1. **Parse Both Times into Minutes**  
   `minutes = hours * 60 + minutes`

2. **Compute the Difference**  
   `delta = correctMinutes - currentMinutes`

3. **Greedy Reduction**  
   For each increment `d` in `[60, 15, 5, 1]`:
   - `ops += delta / d`
   - `delta -= (delta / d) * d`

4. **Return `ops`**

> **Why It Works**  
> Because each operation can add *exactly* 60, 15, 5, or 1 minute, the greedy choice of the largest possible step always yields an optimal solution. This is a classic “coin change” problem with canonical coin denominations.

---

### 2.6 Code Samples – Clean and Reusable

(See Section 1 for full code in Java, Python, and C++.)  
**Tip**: Wrap the parsing logic in a helper method to avoid repetition across languages.

---

### 2.7 Final Thoughts: Turning the Problem into a Job‑Winning Skill

- **Practice Variants**: Try changing the allowed increments to `{10, 20, 30}` and re‑write the greedy algorithm.  
- **Unit Tests**: Write test cases for all edge cases; this demonstrates attention to detail.  
- **Explain Your Reasoning**: In an interview, narrate why the greedy algorithm is optimal (canonical coin system).  
- **Show Time Complexity**: Emphasize that the loop runs at most 4 iterations – a constant amount – so the solution is *O(1)*.  

By mastering LeetCode 2224, you not only solve a neat time‑conversion puzzle but also equip yourself with a portable interview strategy: **“When you can take the biggest step that doesn’t overshoot, do it.”**  

Good luck on your coding interviews—and may that “0”‑minute difference never stand in your way!
