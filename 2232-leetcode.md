        ## 🚀 LeetCode 2232 – Minimize Result by Adding Parentheses to Expression  
### “The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly” – A Job‑Ready Blog Post

> **TL;DR** – Learn how to solve this medium LeetCode problem in Java, Python, and C++, understand the edge cases, analyze the complexity, and see why mastering this trick will make your resume shine in a data‑structures & algorithms interview.

---

### 1️⃣ Problem Recap

You’re given a string `expression` that looks like  

```
<num1>+<num2>
```

Both `<num1>` and `<num2>` are **positive integers** (no leading zeros).  
You may insert **exactly one pair of parentheses** such that:

- The left `(` is placed **to the left of the `+`**.
- The right `)` is placed **to the right of the `+`**.

The resulting expression is then evaluated with normal arithmetic precedence (multiplication before addition).  
Return any expression that yields the **smallest possible value**.  
If multiple expressions give the same minimum, return any one of them.

**Constraints**

| | |
|---|---|
|`3 ≤ expression.length ≤ 10`|Only digits `1-9` and one `+`|
|Result fits in signed 32‑bit int| |

---

### 2️⃣ Intuition & Brute‑Force Insight

A naïve approach is to try every legal pair of indices `(i, j)` for the `(` and `)`:

```
for i in [0 … pos_of_+ - 1]          // left side of '+'
    for j in [pos_of_+ + 1 … len-1]   // right side of '+'
        build new string
        evaluate
```

There are at most `4 × 4 = 16` placements (expression length ≤ 10).  
So a brute‑force O(n²) solution is trivially fast.  

**But** the true insight is that the value of the expression can be expressed as:

```
leftMultiplier * (leftNumber + rightNumber) * rightMultiplier
```

Where:

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
|`leftMultiplier`| digits to the left of `(` (empty ⇒ 1)|
|`leftNumber`| digits inside `(` on the left side of `+`|
|`rightNumber`| digits inside `)` on the right side of `+`|
|`rightMultiplier`| digits to the right of `)` (empty ⇒ 1)|

Thus we can simply iterate over all splits of each side, compute the product, and keep the minimum.

### 3️⃣ The Good

| Feature | Why it matters |
|---|---|
|**O(n²) time, O(1) extra space**| Handles the maximum input size (10 digits) instantly; ideal for interviews.|
|**Clear separation of logic**| Splitting the string once, then iterating over indices is easy to read and test.|
|**Handles edge cases automatically**| Empty multiplier parts are treated as `1`. No need for special if‑checks.|
|**Cross‑language compatibility**| The same algorithm works in Java, Python, and C++ with only small syntax changes.|

---

### 4️⃣ The Bad

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
|Using string concatenation in a tight loop can be slow in Java/C++ if you keep re‑allocating strings. | Use integer arithmetic or `StringBuilder` in Java / `ostringstream` in C++ for clarity. |
|Relying on `eval` (Python’s `eval` or JavaScript) is dangerous and disallowed in interview settings. | Compute the product manually as shown; no `eval`. |
|Hard‑coding indexes based on the position of `+` without validation can cause bugs for malformed inputs. | Always locate the `+` first and guard against out‑of‑bounds indices. |

---

### 5️⃣ The Ugly

| Problem | Why it’s ugly |
|---|---|
|**Nested loops that look complicated**| A beginner might write a 3‑nested loop that builds every possible string and then parses it. It’s hard to debug. |
|**Manual parsing of numbers**| Converting substring to integer character by character is verbose and error‑prone. |
|**Hard‑coded bounds**| Using constants like `1000000000` for initial minimum value is unclear and can break if numbers grow. |
|**Lack of documentation**| Interviewers love code that’s self‑documenting. Without comments or a high‑level explanation, it’s a hard sell. |

### 6️⃣ Reference Implementations

Below are clean, commented solutions in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
All three implement the O(n²) two‑pointer strategy.

#### 6.1 Java (≥ 11)

```java
// LeetCode 2232 – Minimize Result by Adding Parentheses
public class Solution {
    public String minimizeResult(String expression) {
        // Split at '+'
        String[] parts = expression.split("\\+");
        String left = parts[0];
        String right = parts[1];

        int minVal = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        String best = "(" + expression + ")"; // default – parentheses around the whole

        // Choose where '(' goes in the left part
        for (int i = 0; i < left.length(); i++) {
            int leftMul = (i == 0) ? 1 : Integer.parseInt(left.substring(0, i));
            int leftNum = Integer.parseInt(left.substring(i));

            // Choose where ')' goes in the right part
            for (int j = 1; j <= right.length(); j++) {
                int rightNum = Integer.parseInt(right.substring(0, j));
                int rightMul = (j == right.length()) ? 1 : Integer.parseInt(right.substring(j));

                int val = leftMul * (leftNum + rightNum) * rightMul;
                if (val < minVal) {
                    minVal = val;
                    best = left.substring(0, i) + "(" + left.substring(i) + "+"
                            + right.substring(0, j) + ")" + right.substring(j);
                }
            }
        }
        return best;
    }
}
```

> **Complexity** – *Time*: O(n²) (≤ 16 operations). *Space*: O(1) (excluding output string).  
> **Why it passes** – The product never overflows 32‑bit because the problem guarantees that.

#### 6.2 Python 3

```python
# LeetCode 2232 – Minimize Result by Adding Parentheses
class Solution:
    def minimizeResult(self, expression: str) -> str:
        left, right = expression.split('+')

        min_val = float('inf')
        best = f'({expression})'   # whole expression in parentheses

        # Where '(' appears in left
        for i in range(len(left) + 1):          # i == 0 → no multiplier left
            left_mul = 1 if i == 0 else int(left[:i])
            left_num = int(left[i:])

            # Where ')' appears in right
            for j in range(1, len(right) + 1):
                right_num = int(right[:j])
                right_mul = 1 if j == len(right) else int(right[j:])

                val = left_mul * (left_num + right_num) * right_mul
                if val < min_val:
                    min_val = val
                    best = f'{left[:i]}({left[i:]+ "+" + right[:j]}){right[j:]}'
        return best
```

> **Tip** – Use `float('inf')` for an unbounded initial minimum; no magic numbers.  
> **Edge‑case handling** – Empty multipliers are represented by `1` automatically via the ternary logic.

#### 6.3 C++17

```cpp
// LeetCode 2232 – Minimize Result by Adding Parentheses
class Solution {
public:
    string minimizeResult(string expression) {
        // Find the '+' position
        auto plusPos = expression.find('+');
        string left = expression.substr(0, plusPos);
        string right = expression.substr(plusPos + 1);

        int minVal = INT_MAX;
        string best = "(" + expression + ")";      // default

        // '(' inside left side
        for (int i = 0; i < left.size(); ++i) {
            int leftMul = (i == 0) ? 1 : stoi(left.substr(0, i));
            int leftNum = stoi(left.substr(i));

            // ')' inside right side
            for (int j = 1; j <= right.size(); ++j) {
                int rightNum = stoi(right.substr(0, j));
                int rightMul = (j == right.size()) ? 1 : stoi(right.substr(j));

                int val = leftMul * (leftNum + rightNum) * rightMul;
                if (val < minVal) {
                    minVal = val;
                    best = left.substr(0, i) + "(" + left.substr(i) + "+" + right.substr(0, j) + ")"
                         + right.substr(j);
                }
            }
        }
        return best;
    }
};
```

> **Notes** – `stoi` is available in `<string>` since C++11.  
> **Time/Space** – Same as Java/Python.
