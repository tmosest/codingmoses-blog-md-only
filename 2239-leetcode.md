        ## 🚀 LeetCode 2239 – “Find Closest Number to Zero”  
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** Array | **Complexity:** `O(n)` time, `O(1)` space  

> **Problem**  
> Given an integer array `nums`, return the element that is *closest* to `0`.  
> If there are two numbers with the same absolute distance (e.g., `-2` and `2`), return the **larger** one.

> **Examples**  
> 1. `nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]` → `1`  
> 2. `nums = [2,-1,1]` → `1`

> **Constraints**  
> - `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`  
> - `-10^5 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^5`

## 📋 Why This Problem Rocks in Interviews

| ✅ Good | ❌ Bad | ⚡ Ugly |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Simple, clean statement** – ideal for a warm‑up question. | **No edge cases** if you think only about absolute values. | **Ambiguity**: some candidates forget to handle the “larger value on tie” rule. |
| **Single pass** – `O(n)` time, `O(1)` space. | Might tempt you to sort (`O(n log n)`) or use extra memory. | Sorting leads to wrong answer if you keep the first “closest” instead of the larger one. |
| **Language agnostic** – works in Java, Python, C++, etc. | The sign of `0` doesn’t matter, but you must be careful with `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. | Using `abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE)` overflows in Java/C++. |

## 🛠️ Optimal Solution (4 Lines in C++, 5 in Java, 6 in Python)

The key idea: keep two candidates

1. **Closest positive** (`pos`) – the smallest non‑negative number.  
2. **Closest negative** (`neg`) – the largest negative number (closest to zero from the left side).

After scanning the array, decide which one is nearer to zero; on a tie, choose the larger numeric value.

### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findClosestNumber(int[] nums) {
        int pos = Integer.MAX_VALUE;  // closest non‑negative
        int neg = Integer.MIN_VALUE;  // closest negative (largest)
        
        for (int x : nums) {
            if (x >= 0 && x < pos) pos = x;
            if (x < 0 && x > neg) neg = x;
        }
        
        // If one side never appeared, just return the other
        if (pos == Integer.MAX_VALUE) return neg;
        if (neg == Integer.MIN_VALUE) return pos;
        
        // Tie: pos == abs(neg) → pick the larger (pos)
        if (pos == Math.abs(neg)) return pos;
        
        return (pos < Math.abs(neg)) ? pos : neg;
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def findClosestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        pos = float('inf')   # closest non‑negative
        neg = -float('inf')  # closest negative (largest)

        for x in nums:
            if x >= 0 and x < pos:
                pos = x
            if x < 0 and x > neg:
                neg = x

        if pos == float('inf'): return neg
        if neg == -float('inf'): return pos

        # Tie: pick the larger (pos)
        if pos == abs(neg):
            return pos
        return pos if pos < abs(neg) else neg
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findClosestNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int pos = INT_MAX;   // smallest non‑negative
        int neg = INT_MIN;   // largest negative

        for (int x : nums) {
            if (x >= 0 && x < pos) pos = x;
            if (x < 0 && x > neg) neg = x;
        }

        if (pos == INT_MAX) return neg;
        if (neg == INT_MIN) return pos;

        if (pos == abs(neg)) return pos;          // tie → larger
        return (pos < abs(neg)) ? pos : neg;      // closer to zero
    }
};
```

All three implementations run in **`O(n)`** time and **`O(1)`** auxiliary space, and they correctly handle the tie rule.

## 📚 Step‑by‑Step Walkthrough

1. **Initialize** two sentinel values:  
   - `pos = +∞` (or `Integer.MAX_VALUE`) → to store the *smallest* non‑negative number.  
   - `neg = –∞` (or `Integer.MIN_VALUE`) → to store the *largest* negative number.

2. **Scan once**: For each element `x`  
   - If `x >= 0` and `x < pos`, update `pos`.  
   - If `x < 0` and `x > neg`, update `neg`.

3. **Handle missing side**:  
   - If `pos` was never updated → all numbers are negative → return `neg`.  
   - If `neg` was never updated → all numbers are non‑negative → return `pos`.

4. **Resolve tie**:  
   - If `pos == |neg|`, both are equally close → return the larger (`pos`).  
   - Else, return the one with smaller absolute distance to zero.

5. **Return** the chosen value.

## 📑 Blog Article – The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly

### Introduction

When interviewing for a software‑engineering role, interviewers love problems that are *simple to state but tricky to solve correctly*. LeetCode’s **2239 – Find Closest Number to Zero** is one of those hidden gems. The statement is almost too clean: “Return the element closest to zero; on a tie, pick the larger.” Yet, many candidates stumble because they overlook the tie rule or waste time with unnecessary sorting.

In this article, we’ll dissect the problem, explain why it’s great for interviews, and walk through a rock‑solid, **O(n)** solution in Java, Python, and C++. We'll also discuss common pitfalls (the bad) and how to avoid them (the ugly).

---

### The Good: Why This Problem Is a Top‑Tier Interview Question

1. **Clarity of Statement**  
   The problem can be explained in one sentence. No hidden nuances, just a single objective.

2. **Linear Time, Constant Space**  
   The ideal interview challenge: *one pass*, *O(1) memory*. You can demonstrate algorithmic efficiency without resorting to extra data structures.

3. **Language‑agnostic**  
   Works in any mainstream language – Java, Python, C++, Go, JavaScript. Great for candidates who know multiple languages.

4. **Edge‑Case Rich**  
   Although the input range is small (`n ≤ 1000`), the values can be as low as `-10^5`. This forces you to think about sentinel values and avoid overflow.

5. **Tie‑Breaking Requirement**  
   Adds a subtle twist: “If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.” Many candidates ignore this, leading to wrong answers.

### The Bad: Common Misconceptions & Traps

| Misconception | Why It’s Wrong |
|---------------|----------------|
| “Just sort and pick the middle element.” | Sorting is unnecessary and `O(n log n)`. Worse, after sorting you must still compare the two middle elements to decide the larger value. |
| “Return `Math.abs(nums[0])` first encountered.” | You’ll miss a closer negative or a larger positive later in the array. |
| “Use `abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE)` in Java.” | Overflow! `abs(-2^31)` is undefined in Java and will wrap to `-2^31`. |
| “Ignore tie rule.” | You’ll fail on cases like `[2, -2]` or `[0, -1]`. |
| “Use a HashMap to store absolute values.” | Extra memory (`O(n)`) and still need to resolve tie. |

---

### The Ugly: Why Some Solutions Look Messy

Some candidates write a 20‑line brute force with nested loops, or they rely on streams and lambda expressions that obscure the core logic. A messy solution not only risks performance penalties but also makes it hard for the interviewer to see that you understand the algorithmic principles.

---

### Clean, Readable Code – The Real “Nice”

Below we present a concise, 4‑line core logic (excluding boilerplate). We’ll see how to translate it into three popular languages.

#### Java (5 lines inside method)

```java
int pos = Integer.MAX_VALUE, neg = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
for (int x : nums) {
    if (x >= 0 && x < pos) pos = x;
    if (x < 0 && x > neg) neg = x;
}
return pos == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? neg
       : neg == Integer.MIN_VALUE ? pos
       : pos == Math.abs(neg) ? pos
       : pos < Math.abs(neg) ? pos : neg;
```

#### Python (7 lines inside method)

```python
pos, neg = float('inf'), -float('inf')
for x in nums:
    if x >= 0 and x < pos: pos = x
    if x < 0 and x > neg: neg = x
return neg if pos == float('inf') else pos if neg == -float('inf') else pos if pos == abs(neg) else pos if pos < abs(neg) else neg
```

#### C++ (4 lines inside method)

```cpp
int pos = INT_MAX, neg = INT_MIN;
for (int x : nums) {
    if (x >= 0 && x < pos) pos = x;
    if (x < 0 && x > neg) neg = x;
}
return pos == INT_MAX ? neg
       : neg == INT_MIN ? pos
       : pos == abs(neg) ? pos
       : pos < abs(neg) ? pos : neg;
```

*Why does this work?*  
- **Sentinel values** guarantee that we always have a valid comparison later.  
- The ternary chain handles all 4 scenarios in a single return statement.  
- No auxiliary data structures, no sorting – just linear scan.

### 🚀 Interview Prep Checklist

| ✅ | Item |
|----|------|
| 1 | Read the problem statement carefully (especially the tie rule). |
| 2 | Understand constraints (`n ≤ 1000`, values up to `±10^5`). |
| 3 | Think of an `O(n)` solution – a single pass with two variables. |
| 4 | Test on edge cases: all negative, all positive, mixed, tie. |
| 5 | Code in your preferred language, then translate to others. |
| 6 | Discuss time/space complexity clearly. |
