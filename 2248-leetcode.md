### Problem Recap (LeetCode 2248)

> **Intersection of Multiple Arrays**  
> **Difficulty:** *Easy*  
> **Signature (Java):** `public List<Integer> intersection(int[][] nums);`  

You are given a 2‚ÄëD array `nums`.  
Each `nums[i]` is a non‚Äëempty array of **distinct positive integers**.  
Return a sorted list of integers that appear in **every** array of `nums`.

**Examples**

| Input | Output | Explanation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `[[3,1,2,4,5],[1,2,3,4],[3,4,5,6]]` | `[3,4]` | Only 3 and 4 appear in all three arrays |
| `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]` | `[]` | No common element |

**Constraints**

* `1 ‚â§ nums.length ‚â§ 1000`
* `1 ‚â§ sum(nums[i].length) ‚â§ 1000`
* `1 ‚â§ nums[i][j] ‚â§ 1000`
* All numbers inside a single array are distinct.

## üìå Core Idea

Because the maximum value of an element is **1000**, a *frequency array* of size `1001` is enough.  
For every number we keep a counter of how many arrays it appeared in.  
After processing all arrays we collect numbers whose counter equals `nums.length`.

This yields **O(total_elements)** time and **O(1)** additional memory (1001 integers).

Other approaches:
* **Set intersection** (HashSet) ‚Äì clean but slightly heavier on memory/time.
* **Sorting** each array and performing a multi‚Äëpointer merge ‚Äì unnecessary for this constraints.

## üß© Code Solutions

Below are three self‚Äëcontained solutions in Java, Python, and C++.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Java ‚Äì Frequency Array

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> intersection(int[][] nums) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int[] freq = new int[1001]; // index 0 unused (values start at 1)

        for (int[] arr : nums) {
            for (int val : arr) {
                freq[val]++;            // count appearance per array
            }
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
            if (freq[i] == nums.length) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

> **Time Complexity:** `O(totalElements)`  
> **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (fixed 1001 ints)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Python ‚Äì Counter (frequency array via list)

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        freq = [0] * 1001   # values 1..1000

        for arr in nums:
            for val in arr:
                freq[val] += 1

        return [i for i in range(1, 1001) if freq[i] == len(nums)]
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ C++ ‚Äì Frequency Array

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> intersection(vector<vector<int>>& nums) {
        vector<int> freq(1001, 0);          // indices 0..1000
        for (auto &arr : nums) {
            for (int val : arr) freq[val]++;  // count per array
        }
        vector<int> ans;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; ++i)
            if (freq[i] == nums.size()) ans.push_back(i);
        return ans;
    }
};
```

All three implementations are **O(totalElements)** and produce a sorted list of common integers.

### The Good: Why This Problem Is a Goldmine for Interview Prep

1. **Simplicity, Yet Deep Insight**  
   The problem looks trivial, but it forces you to think about *data structures* that balance speed and memory.  
   Choosing the right approach (frequency array vs. set vs. sorting) demonstrates understanding of time/space trade‚Äëoffs‚Äîa key interview skill.

2. **Clear Constraints Let You Optimize**  
   With `max(nums[i][j]) = 1000`, you can exploit a bounded frequency array.  
   Highlighting this optimization shows you can read constraints and adapt your algorithm accordingly.

3. **Deterministic Output**  
   The sorted list requirement is a tiny but important detail that tests your attention to detail‚Äîanother interview staple.

4. **Cross‚ÄëLanguage Consistency**  
   Having working solutions in Java, Python, and C++ demonstrates adaptability and code‚Äëtransferability, which hiring managers love.

### The Bad: Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

| Pitfall | Why It Happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Using a Set for each array and repeatedly intersecting** | Thought that ‚Äúset intersection‚Äù is always fastest | Set operations are `O(n)` but with larger constants; plus you allocate new sets each time. |
| **Ignoring the ‚Äúdistinct‚Äù guarantee** | Assuming duplicates inside a single array | If duplicates were possible, you'd need a `HashSet` per array to dedupe before counting. |
| **Iterating over the entire 1001 size array** | Mistaking it as a big O cost | It's O(1); no real cost. |
| **Returning unsorted list** | Forgetting to sort or using an unordered container | Either sort the final vector/list or iterate in ascending order (as in the frequency array). |

### The Ugly: Edge Cases That Can Trip You Up

1. **Empty Intersection**  
   When no number appears in every array, you must return an empty list. A wrong counter check (e.g., `== nums.length - 1`) would produce a wrong answer.

2. **Large Number of Arrays vs. Small Total Elements**  
   `nums.length` can be up to 1000, but the sum of all elements is also bounded by 1000.  
   A naive approach that builds a map for every element might still pass, but it‚Äôs unnecessary. Optimize for the given bounds.

3. **Input Formatting in Different Languages**  
   In C++ you must be careful with `vector<vector<int>>& nums` vs. `vector<vector<int>> nums` to avoid copies.  
   In Java, using `int[][]` is fine, but you need to remember that `int` is primitive; no boxing overhead.

## üìå Takeaway Checklist

- [ ] Use a frequency array (size 1001) for the best time‚Äëspace trade‚Äëoff.  
- [ ] Count each element only once per array.  
- [ ] Collect elements whose count equals `nums.length`.  
- [ ] Return the result in ascending order (iteration order ensures sorting).  
- [ ] Test edge cases: empty intersection, single array, maximum constraints.

Happy coding, and good luck landing that dream job!
