        # 2268 – Minimum Number of Keypresses  
**LeetCode** | Difficulty : Medium  

> *“You have a keypad with 9 buttons, numbered from 1 to 9, each mapped to lowercase English letters.”*  
> *“Given a string s, return the minimum number of keypresses needed to type s using your keypad.”*

## Why This Problem Is a Great Interview Question

*  **Real‑world analogy** – you’re essentially designing an efficient T9 keypad.  
*  **Greedy + Counting** – a classic pattern that every interviewer wants to see.  
*  **Scalable** – `s` can be up to 100 000 characters, so an O(n) solution is required.

## TL;DR – The One‑liner Idea

1. Count how many times each of the 26 letters appears in `s`.  
2. Sort those frequencies in **descending** order.  
3. The first 9 letters cost **1 press** each, the next 9 cost **2 presses**, the remaining 8 cost **3 presses**.  

The total is the sum of *frequency × presses*.

## The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

| Category | What You Should Do | What to Avoid | Why it Matters |
|----------|--------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Good** | Use an array of size 26 for counting – O(1) space. | | Fast, cache‑friendly. |
| | Sort the 26 values only – O(26 log 26) ≈ O(1). | | Sorting the whole string would blow up. |
| | Apply the greedy “most frequent → least presses” rule. | | Proven optimal. |
| **Bad** | **Avoid** building a map or using `Collections.frequency` for every letter. | | That would be O(26 · n). |
| | **Avoid** sorting the entire string. | | `O(n log n)` would exceed the limit for 100 k. |
| **Ugly** | Some people try to build an explicit keypad layout and then simulate typing. | | Over‑engineering – unnecessary complexity. |
| | Using `int[]` but forgetting to initialize to zero can lead to NPEs in Java. | | Defensive programming pays off. |

## Algorithm in Detail

1. **Frequency Counting**  
   For each character `c` in `s` increment `freq[c - 'a']`.

2. **Descending Sort**  
   Sort `freq` in descending order.

3. **Greedy Accumulation**  
   ```
   presses = 0
   for i from 0 to 25:
       if i < 9:        presses += freq[i] * 1
       else if i < 18:  presses += freq[i] * 2
       else:            presses += freq[i] * 3
   ```

4. Return `presses`.

## Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Counting | **O(n)** | O(1) (26 integers) |
| Sorting 26 numbers | **O(26 log 26)** → effectively O(1) | O(1) |
| Final pass | **O(26)** | O(1) |
| **Total** | **O(n)** | **O(1)** |

`n` ≤ 100 000 → comfortably fast in Java, Python, and C++.

## Implementation – Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minimumKeypresses(String s) {
        // 1. Frequency counting
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            freq[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }

        // 2. Sort descending
        Arrays.sort(freq);                     // ascending
        reverse(freq);                         // now descending

        // 3. Greedy accumulation
        int presses = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            int mult = i < 9 ? 1 : i < 18 ? 2 : 3;
            presses += freq[i] * mult;
        }
        return presses;
    }

    // helper to reverse an int array
    private void reverse(int[] a) {
        int l = 0, r = a.length - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            int tmp = a[l];
            a[l] = a[r];
            a[r] = tmp;
            l++;
            r--;
        }
    }
}
```

*Why reverse?*  
`Arrays.sort()` gives ascending order. Reversing yields the needed descending order.

## Implementation – Python

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def minimumKeypresses(self, s: str) -> int:
        freq = Counter(s)                       # 26 keys at most
        counts = sorted(freq.values(), reverse=True)

        presses = 0
        for i, c in enumerate(counts):
            mult = 1 if i < 9 else 2 if i < 18 else 3
            presses += c * mult
        return presses
```

*Tip:*  
`Counter` is a `dict`‑like object; `values()` returns an iterable of the frequencies.

---

## Implementation – C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumKeypresses(string s) {
        int freq[26] = {0};
        for (char c : s) ++freq[c - 'a'];

        vector<int> v(freq, freq + 26);
        sort(v.begin(), v.end(), greater<int>());   // descending

        int presses = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            int mult = (i < 9) ? 1 : (i < 18) ? 2 : 3;
            presses += v[i] * mult;
        }
        return presses;
    }
};
```

## Edge‑Case Checklist

| Edge Case | How Our Code Handles It |
|-----------|------------------------|
| All letters appear once | First 9 get 1 press, next 9 get 2, rest 3. |
| Only one letter repeated 100 k times | Frequency 100 k, sorted first, 1 × 100 k presses. |
| String length 1 | Single frequency, 1 press. |
| All 26 letters present | The greedy rule still applies. |
