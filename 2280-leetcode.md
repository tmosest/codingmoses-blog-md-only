## 1. Problem Recap (LeetCode 2280)

> **Given** a list of points `stockPrices[i] = [dayi, pricei]` (distinct days, arbitrary order).  
> **Goal:** Connect consecutive points with straight lines. **Return** the *minimum* number of straight lines that are required to represent the entire chart.  

**Constraints**

| | |
|---|---|
| `1 ≤ stockPrices.length ≤ 10⁵` | `1 ≤ dayi, pricei ≤ 10⁹` |
| All `dayi` are distinct | – |

The challenge is to detect when a series of consecutive points lies on the same straight line. A change in slope forces a new line.

---

## 2. High‑Level Approach

1. **Sort** the points by day (`x` coordinate).  
2. Compute the *difference vector* between every consecutive pair:  
   `Δx = xᵢ – xᵢ₋₁`, `Δy = yᵢ – yᵢ₋₁`.  
3. Two consecutive segments belong to the same line iff  
   `Δx₁ * Δy₂ == Δx₂ * Δy₁`  (cross‑multiplication avoids floating‑point division).  
4. Increment a counter every time the above equality fails.  
5. Special handling: a single point needs **0** lines, two points need **1** line.

Complexity:  
- **Time:** `O(n log n)` due to sorting (`n ≤ 10⁵`).  
- **Space:** `O(1)` (apart from the input array).

## 3. Code Implementations

Below are clean, production‑ready solutions in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
Each uses integer arithmetic only, so it is safe from precision errors.

---

### 3.1 Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int minimumLines(int[][] stockPrices) {
        int n = stockPrices.length;
        if (n <= 1) return 0;        // no line needed
        if (n == 2) return 1;        // one segment

        // 1. Sort by day (x-coordinate)
        Arrays.sort(stockPrices, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        // 2. Initial slope components
        long dxPrev = stockPrices[1][0] - stockPrices[0][0];
        long dyPrev = stockPrices[1][1] - stockPrices[0][1];

        int lines = 1;               // at least one line

        // 3. Scan the rest
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            long dxCurr = stockPrices[i][0] - stockPrices[i - 1][0];
            long dyCurr = stockPrices[i][1] - stockPrices[i - 1][1];

            // Cross‑multiplication to compare slopes
            if (dxCurr * dyPrev != dxPrev * dyCurr) {
                lines++;            // slope changed → new line
            }

            // Prepare for next iteration
            dxPrev = dxCurr;
            dyPrev = dyCurr;
        }

        return lines;
    }
}
```

> **Why long?**  
> Differences can be up to `10⁹`, and their product up to `10¹⁸`, which fits in a signed 64‑bit integer.

---

### 3.2 Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumLines(self, stockPrices: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(stockPrices)
        if n <= 1:
            return 0
        if n == 2:
            return 1

        # Sort by day
        stockPrices.sort(key=lambda p: p[0])

        # Initial slope components
        dx_prev = stockPrices[1][0] - stockPrices[0][0]
        dy_prev = stockPrices[1][1] - stockPrices[0][1]

        lines = 1

        for i in range(2, n):
            dx_curr = stockPrices[i][0] - stockPrices[i - 1][0]
            dy_curr = stockPrices[i][1] - stockPrices[i - 1][1]

            if dx_curr * dy_prev != dx_prev * dy_curr:
                lines += 1

            dx_prev, dy_prev = dx_curr, dy_curr

        return lines
```

---

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLines(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& stockPrices) {
        int n = stockPrices.size();
        if (n <= 1) return 0;
        if (n == 2) return 1;

        // Sort by day
        std::sort(stockPrices.begin(), stockPrices.end(),
                  [](const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
                      return a[0] < b[0];
                  });

        long long dxPrev = stockPrices[1][0] - stockPrices[0][0];
        long long dyPrev = stockPrices[1][1] - stockPrices[0][1];

        int lines = 1;

        for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
            long long dxCurr = stockPrices[i][0] - stockPrices[i - 1][0];
            long long dyCurr = stockPrices[i][1] - stockPrices[i - 1][1];

            if (dxCurr * dyPrev != dxPrev * dyCurr) {
                ++lines;  // slope changed
            }

            dxPrev = dxCurr;
            dyPrev = dyCurr;
        }

        return lines;
    }
};
```

### 4.1 Introduction

When you’re prepping for a software‑engineering interview, you’ll run into problems that ask you to **detect collinearity** among points—think of the classic “convex hull” or “line intersection” problems.  
LeetCode 2280, **Minimum Lines to Represent a Line Chart**, is a perfect playground: you’re given a set of stock prices on distinct days, and you need to stitch the most compact straight‑line representation.  

In this article we’ll dissect the *good*, *bad*, and *ugly* parts of solving this challenge, walk through the math, show you three polished solutions, and give you interview‑ready tricks.

---

### 4.2 The Good – Straight‑Forward Mathematics

- **Slope Equality via Cross‑Multiplication**  
  `Δx₁ * Δy₂ == Δx₂ * Δy₁`  
  This eliminates division entirely, sidestepping floating‑point pitfalls.  
- **Sorting by Day**  
  Once sorted, the points are guaranteed to be in chronological order, so consecutive differences are always meaningful.  
- **Linear Scan**  
  After sorting, a single pass suffices to count line breaks.  

> *Result:* A clear, O(n log n) algorithm that scales to the maximum input size of 100,000 points.

---

### 4.3 The Bad – Common Pitfalls

| Issue | Why It Happens | Fix |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| **Using floating‑point division** | 1,000,000,000 / 3 may lose precision. | Use cross‑multiplication or big‑integer rational. |
| **Ignoring sorting** | Points may be given unsorted; you’ll miss slope changes. | Sort by day first. |
| **Integer overflow** | `Δx * Δy` can exceed 32‑bit. | Use 64‑bit (`long` / `long long`). |
| **Edge cases** | Single point → 0 lines, two points → 1 line. | Handle separately before the main loop. |

---

### 4.4 The Ugly – Over‑engineering & Sub‑Optimal Choices

- **BigDecimal in Java**  
  Some solutions use `BigDecimal` to compute gains. While mathematically precise, it incurs heavy overhead (`O(n)` with high constant factors).  
- **Repeated Division**  
  Computing slopes as double and comparing equality is risky due to rounding errors.  
- **Ignoring In‑Place Sorting**  
  Copying the array or creating a new list wastes memory.  

> *Takeaway:* Keep the algorithm lean. Complexity is not only about big‑O but also constant‑time overhead.

---

### 4.5 Step‑by‑Step Derivation

1. **Sort the points**:  
   `points.sort(key=lambda p: p[0])` (Java & C++: `std::sort` or `Arrays.sort`).  
2. **Initial vector**:  
   `dx_prev = x₂ – x₁`, `dy_prev = y₂ – y₁`.  
3. **Loop** over `i = 3 … n` (0‑based indexing) and compute current differences.  
4. **Compare** using cross‑multiplication.  
5. **Increment** the counter when the product differs.  

That’s it—no extra arrays, no division, no floating‑point comparisons.

---

### 4.5 Complexity Analysis

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Sorting | `O(n log n)` | `O(1)` extra (in‑place). |
| Linear Scan | `O(n)` | `O(1)` |
| Total | `O(n log n)` | `O(1)` |

The memory‑footprint is minimal—just the input array—which is ideal for interviews.

---

### 4.6 Interview‑Ready Tips

1. **Explain the math first** – “I’ll use cross‑multiplication so I never divide.”  
2. **Talk through edge cases** – “One point means no lines; two points is one line.”  
3. **Mention overflow** – “Because differences can be up to 10⁹, I’ll store the products in a 64‑bit integer.”  
4. **Show your code’s safety** – “All arithmetic is integer; no floating‑point errors.”  
5. **Discuss time‑space trade‑offs** – “I avoid BigDecimal to keep runtime fast; the cross‑mult approach is O(n log n) and constant‑time.”  

---

### 4.7 Optimizing Further (If You’re a Power User)

| Idea | When It Helps |
|------|---------------|
| **Counting with a dictionary of slopes** | If you need to group *all* segments by slope, you can store `(dx, dy)` pairs in a `HashMap`.  
| **Parallel sort** | On a multicore machine, Java’s `Arrays.parallelSort` or C++’s `std::sort` can split work. |
| **Radix sort** | Since `day` is ≤ 10⁹, a base‑10^5 radix sort can beat comparison‑based sorting on large inputs. | Only necessary if you hit TLE on the sort step. |

---

### 4.8 Take‑away Checklist for the Interview

- [ ] **Sort the points by day** (O(n log n)).  
- [ ] **Use 64‑bit integers** for difference products.  
- [ ] **Compare slopes with cross‑multiplication**.  
- [ ] **Handle 1‑point & 2‑point edge cases**.  
- [ ] **Explain your logic** clearly to the interviewer.  

---

### 4.9 Final Thoughts

LeetCode 2280 is deceptively simple: you’re stitching a chart with as few straight lines as possible.  
The crux is detecting a *change in slope*, which is a classic collinearity test.  
By sorting once, then walking linearly with integer math, you can deliver a **clean, efficient** solution in any language.

**Show your interviewer you know the math, respect the constraints, and keep your code lean.**  
Good luck—*you’ll ace this one!* 🚀
