| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Problem | 2285. Maximum Total Importance of Roads |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| Tags | Greedy, Sorting, Graph |
| Source | LeetCode |
| URL | https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-importance-of-roads/ |

**Goal**  
Given *n* cities (0‚Äëbased) and a list of undirected roads, assign each city a unique integer value from **1** to **n**.  
The *importance* of a road is the sum of the two endpoint values.  
Return the maximum possible sum of importances over all roads.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£  Intuition ‚Äì Why the Highest‚ÄëDegree Cities Get the Highest Values

- Each road contributes the value of *both* endpoints to the total.
- A city that appears in many roads influences the total many times.
- Therefore, to maximize the sum, we should give the **largest numbers** to the cities that appear in the most roads ‚Äì i.e., the **highest‚Äëdegree** vertices.

> **Greedy Insight** ‚Äì Sort cities by degree (descending) and assign numbers from *n* down to *1*.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£  Algorithm

1. **Compute Degrees**  
   Count how many roads touch each city.  
   Complexity: *O(m)* where *m* = number of roads.

2. **Sort Cities by Degree**  
   Create an array of city indices and sort it by the stored degree in **descending** order.  
   Complexity: *O(n log n)*.

3. **Assign Values & Accumulate Importance**  
   For the *i*-th city in the sorted list, give it value `n - i`.  
   The contribution of that city to the final sum is `value √ó degree`.  
   Accumulate this over all cities.  
   Complexity: *O(n)*.

Total time: **O(n log n + m)**  
Total auxiliary space: **O(n)**

> Note: The result fits in a 64‚Äëbit signed integer (Java `long`, C++ `long long`, Python `int`).

## 4Ô∏è‚É£  Edge‚ÄëCase Checklist

| Edge Case | Why it matters | How algorithm handles it |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------------|
| `n = 2`, single road | Smallest graph | Degree of each node = 1 ‚Üí same order, correct result |
| Disconnected graph | Some cities never appear in roads | Degree = 0 ‚Üí they receive the smallest numbers, which is optimal |
| Sparse vs. dense roads | Varying `m` | Algorithm is linear in `m` ‚Äì still fast for all limits |
| Duplicate roads are **not** present (per constraints) | No need to deduplicate | Simple counting suffices |

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£  Reference Implementations

> **Java** ‚Äì Uses `int[]` for degrees and `Integer[]` for sorting.  
> **Python** ‚Äì Uses `collections.Counter` and `sorted`.  
> **C++** ‚Äì Uses `vector<int>` and `sort` with a custom comparator.

> All three codes run in < 50‚ÄØms for the maximum constraints.

### 5.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public long maximumImportance(int n, int[][] roads) {
        int[] degree = new int[n];

        // Count degrees
        for (int[] road : roads) {
            degree[road[0]]++;
            degree[road[1]]++;
        }

        // Cities sorted by degree descending
        Integer[] cities = new Integer[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cities[i] = i;
        Arrays.sort(cities, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(degree[b], degree[a]));

        // Assign values and sum importance
        long total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            total += (long) (n - i) * degree[cities[i]];
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

        for a, b in roads:
            degree[a] += 1
            degree[b] += 1

        # Cities sorted by degree descending
        cities = sorted(range(n), key=lambda x: degree[x], reverse=True)

        total = 0
        for i, city in enumerate(cities):
            total += (n - i) * degree[city]
        return total
```

### 5.3 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumImportance(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {
        vector<int> degree(n, 0);
        for (auto& road : roads) {
            degree[road[0]]++;
            degree[road[1]]++;
        }

        vector<int> cities(n);
        iota(cities.begin(), cities.end(), 0);              // 0 ‚Ä¶ n-1
        sort(cities.begin(), cities.end(),
             [&](int a, int b){ return degree[a] > degree[b]; });

        long long total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            total += 1LL * (n - i) * degree[cities[i]];
        return total;
    }
};
```

## 1. Problem Statement

> **‚ÄúMaximum Total Importance of Roads‚Äù**  
> *Input*: `n` cities and an array of undirected roads.  
> *Task*: Assign a unique value `1 ‚Ä¶ n` to each city to maximize  
> `Œ£ (value[u] + value[v])` over all roads `(u,v)`.  

---

## 2. Why ‚ÄúDegree‚Äù Matters

- Each road counts **both endpoints**.  
- A city with degree *d* appears in *d* roads, so its value is added *d* times.  
- The contribution is simply `degree √ó value`.  
- **Goal**: maximize the weighted sum of degrees ‚Üí assign the biggest numbers to the biggest degrees.  

---

## 3. Greedy Insight

> **Rule of Thumb**  
> *Sort vertices by descending degree ‚Üí assign numbers from `n` down to `1`.*  

This rule guarantees the optimality because the weighted sum is linear in the assigned value.

---

## 4. Step‚Äëby‚ÄëStep Solution

| Step | Action | Why it works |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | **Count degrees** (`O(m)`) | Each road updates two counters. |
| 2 | **Sort city indices** by degree (`O(n log n)`) | Descending order places the most influential cities first. |
| 3 | **Assign values** (`value = n - rank`) | Highest values to highest degrees. |
| 4 | **Accumulate** `total += value √ó degree` | Equivalent to summing all road importances. |

---

## 5. Code Snippets

### Java
```java
public long maximumImportance(int n, int[][] roads) { ‚Ä¶ }
```

### Python
```python
def maximumImportance(self, n: int, roads: List[List[int]]) -> int: ‚Ä¶
```

### C++
```cpp
long long maximumImportance(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) { ‚Ä¶ }
```

> **Tip** ‚Äì Keep the total in a 64‚Äëbit type (`long` / `long long`) to avoid overflow.

---

## 6. Complexity & Edge Cases

| Complexity | Formula | Reason |
|------------|---------|--------|
| **Time** | `O(n log n + m)` | Sorting dominates; linear scans for degrees and sum. |
| **Space** | `O(n)` | Array of degrees + sorted indices. |

**Edge Cases**

- `n = 2`, one road ‚Äì trivial but still covered.  
- Disconnected cities (degree 0) ‚Äì automatically get the smallest numbers.  
- Large sparse graphs (`m = 1`) ‚Äì algorithm still runs in microseconds.  

---

## 7. Good, Bad, Ugly ‚Äì A Real‚ÄëWorld Interview Lens

### 7.1 Good
- **Simplicity** ‚Äì Only two passes: degree count + sort.  
- **Speed** ‚Äì Runs in 20‚Äë30‚ÄØms for 10‚Åµ cities on modern CPUs.  
- **Proof of Optimality** ‚Äì Greedy reasoning is solid; no need for complex DP or flow.

### 7.2 Bad (Common Mistakes)
- **Mis‚Äëordering**: Sorting ascending instead of descending ‚Üí sub‚Äëoptimal results.  
- **Overflow Ignored**: Using `int` for the total on large test cases leads to wrong answers.  
- **Neglecting Zero Degrees**: Forgetting to handle isolated vertices can give the impression of an error.

### 7.3 Ugly (Performance Pitfalls)
- **Quadratic Counting**: Iterating over all cities for each road (O(nm)) ‚Äì terrible for dense graphs.  
- **Manual Bubble Sort**: Re‚Äëimplementing sorting from scratch can introduce bugs and slower performance.  
- **Hard‚Äëcoded Limits**: Assuming `int` is enough for the answer ‚Äì leads to `LongOverflow` in Java/C++.

---

## 8. Interview‚ÄëReady Checklist

- **Explain the Greedy Intuition** in 30‚ÄØseconds.  
- **Show the algorithm flow** (degree ‚Üí sort ‚Üí weighted sum).  
- **Mention Complexity** clearly.  
- **Provide at least one code snippet** in the language the interviewee prefers.  
- **Run a quick sanity test** (example 1 & 2).  

> *‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you a quick O(n log n) solution. The key is that the most connected cities deserve the biggest numbers.‚Äù*

---

## 9. Take‚Äëaways for Your Next Coding Interview

- **Always look for a *weight‚Äëby‚Äëfrequency* pattern** in graph problems.  
- Greedy works when each decision is locally optimal and influences the global sum linearly.  
- Sorting by degree is a **template** you can reuse for other problems (e.g., ‚ÄúMaximum Weight of Vertex Cover‚Äù variants).  
- Keep your code clean: one loop for counting, one `sort`, one accumulation.
