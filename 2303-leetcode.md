        ## 🚀 LeetCode 2303 – “Calculate Amount Paid in Taxes”  
**Language‑agnostic solutions (Java / Python / C++)**  
**Blog article** – The good, the bad, and the ugly of tackling this problem in an interview, plus a quick SEO‑boosted guide to land that coding job.

### TL;DR

- **Goal**: Given progressive tax brackets and an income, compute the exact amount of tax you owe.
- **Time**: O(n) – one pass through the brackets.  
- **Space**: O(1) – constant extra memory.
- **Accepted answer**: `double`, precision up to `1e-5`.

---

## 1. Problem Recap

> **Input**  
> - `brackets`: 2‑D array, `brackets[i] = [upper_i, percent_i]`  
> - `income`: integer amount earned  
> 
> **Output**  
> - Total tax owed as a `double`

The brackets are **sorted by upper bound** and the last upper bound is always `≥ income`.  
Each bracket represents a *progressive* tax band:  
- The first `upper0` dollars are taxed at `percent0%`.  
- The next `upper1 – upper0` dollars at `percent1%`, etc.

---

## 2. Brute‑Force Intuition

Walk through the brackets, determine how many dollars fall in the current band, compute the tax, and accumulate it.

```text
for each bracket (upper, percent):
    taxable = min(income, upper - previousUpper)
    tax += taxable * percent / 100
    income -= taxable
    previousUpper = upper
```

Once `income` is zero we can stop early.

## 3. Code Implementations

### 3.1 Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public double calculateTax(int[][] brackets, int income) {
        double tax = 0.0;
        int lower = 0;                     // lower bound of current bracket

        for (int[] bracket : brackets) {
            int upper = bracket[0];
            int percent = bracket[1];

            // How much income falls into this bracket
            double taxable = Math.min(income, upper - lower);
            tax += taxable * percent / 100.0; // apply rate
            income -= taxable;                // remove processed amount

            if (income <= 0) break;           // all income taxed
            lower = upper;                    // move to next bracket
        }
        return tax;
    }
}
```

> **Why `double`?**  
> The problem requires a floating‑point result; using `double` gives the needed precision (`10⁻⁵`).  
> **Complexity** – `O(n)` time, `O(1)` space.

---

### 3.2 Python 3

```python
class Solution:
    def calculateTax(self, brackets: List[List[int]], income: int) -> float:
        tax = 0.0
        lower = 0

        for upper, percent in brackets:
            taxable = min(income, upper - lower)
            tax += taxable * percent / 100.0
            income -= taxable
            if income <= 0:
                break
            lower = upper

        return tax
```

> **Python Tips**  
> - `min()` keeps the code concise.  
> - The `List[List[int]]` type hint is optional but recommended for readability.

---

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double calculateTax(vector<vector<int>>& brackets, int income) {
        double tax = 0.0;
        int lower = 0;

        for (const auto& bracket : brackets) {
            int upper   = bracket[0];
            int percent = bracket[1];

            int taxable = min(income, upper - lower);
            tax += taxable * percent / 100.0;
            income -= taxable;

            if (income <= 0) break;
            lower = upper;
        }
        return tax;
    }
};
```

> **Why `std::min`?**  
> The STL function keeps the logic identical to Java/Python.

## 4. Why the Code Works

| Step | What it does | Why it matters |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| `taxable = min(income, upper - lower)` | Determines how many dollars are taxed at the current rate | Handles the *partial* bracket when income < remaining upper bound |
| `tax += taxable * percent / 100.0` | Accumulates tax in a floating‑point value | Maintains required precision |
| `income -= taxable` | Removes the taxed portion | Moves to the next bracket |
| `if (income <= 0) break` | Early exit | Avoids unnecessary iterations (optimality) |

Because the brackets are sorted, each income dollar is processed **exactly once** – ensuring linear time.

## 5. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of this Interview Problem

### The Good
1. **Clear problem statement** – Progressive tax is a common interview scenario.
2. **Simple loop** – Easy to reason about, no recursion or DP needed.
3. **Scales well** – Up to 100 brackets, trivial computational cost.
4. **Real‑world relevance** – Tax calculation logic appears in finance, payroll systems, and coding contests.

### The Bad
1. **Precision pitfalls** – Using `float` instead of `double` can lead to `1e‑5` errors.
2. **Off‑by‑one errors** – Forgetting to update `lower` after each iteration or mis‑calculating the bracket width.
3. **Edge cases** – Income exactly equals a bracket upper bound; zero income; zero percent tax.
4. **LeetCode input parsing** – Sometimes `brackets` may come in as nested arrays of unknown length, requiring robust parsing.

### The Ugly
1. **Interview stress** – Candidates might over‑think the problem, adding unnecessary data structures.
2. **Time‑zone confusion** – Some may misinterpret the order of brackets; always remember the array is sorted.
3. **Language quirks** – In Java, integer division silently truncates, so casting to `double` is essential.
4. **Hidden constraints** – The problem guarantees that the last bracket upper bound ≥ income; forgetting this can make the solution incomplete.

## 8. Final Thoughts

- **Keep it Simple** – One linear loop is all you need.  
- **Mind the Precision** – Always use `double` (Java/C++) or `float` with care (Python `float`).  
- **Test Edge Cases** – Zero income, zero percent, income equals upper bound.  
- **Document Your Thought Process** – Interviewers appreciate clarity; explain why you chose the algorithm and how you handled pitfalls.

Happy coding, and may your next interview be all about the *good* and *clean* solution you just built! 🚀
