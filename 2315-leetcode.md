        ## 1️⃣ Problem Overview  
**LeetCode 2315 – Count Asterisks**  
> **Difficulty:** *Easy*  
> **Tags:** String, Two‑Pointers, Linear Scan  

You are given a string `s`. Every two consecutive vertical bars `|` form a *pair*.  
All characters **between** a pair of `|` are *ignored*.  
Return the number of `*` that are **outside** any such pair.

> **Example**  
> `s = "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|"` → answer = **2**

---

## 2️⃣ Why This Problem Rocks for Interviews  

* It tests **linear‑time string traversal** – a staple in interviews.  
* Requires thinking about **state toggling** (`inside |…|` vs. `outside`).  
* A perfect illustration of the “scan once, count” pattern.  

---

## 3️⃣ Solution Idea (The “One‑Pass” Pattern)

1. **Maintain a boolean flag** `inside = false`.  
2. Traverse the string once.  
   * When you meet `|` toggle `inside`.  
   * When you meet `*` and `inside` is `false`, increment the counter.  
3. Return the counter.

> **Why it works** – Because every pair of `|` is guaranteed to be even, the flag will correctly reflect whether we are inside a block at any time.

## 4️⃣ Code Implementations  

Below are clean, production‑ready implementations in **Java, Python, and C++**.  
All three share the same one‑pass logic and run in `O(n)` time with `O(1)` auxiliary space.

| Language | Complexity | Code |
|----------|------------|------|
| **Java** | `O(n)` time, `O(1)` space | **Java 17** (JDK 17+ recommended) |
| **Python** | `O(n)` time, `O(1)` space | **Python 3.9** |
| **C++** | `O(n)` time, `O(1)` space | **C++17** (g++‑10 or newer) |

### 4.1 Java

```java
/**
 *  LeetCode 2315 – Count Asterisks
 *
 *  One‑pass linear scan with a boolean toggle.
 *  Time   : O(n)
 *  Space  : O(1)
 */
public class Solution {
    public int countAsterisks(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        boolean inside = false;          // false → outside any '|...|'

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);

            if (ch == '|') {              // toggle the state
                inside = !inside;
                continue;                 // '|' itself never counts
            }

            if (!inside && ch == '*') {   // count only when outside
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

> **Why this Java version is SEO‑friendly**  
> * Uses clear method name `countAsterisks` – matches LeetCode’s signature.  
> * Simple `for‑loop` – no extra objects → fast runtime.  
> * No unnecessary static blocks or hacks.

### 4.2 Python

```python
"""
LeetCode 2315 – Count Asterisks
Python 3.9 implementation
"""

class Solution:
    def countAsterisks(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        inside = False   # False → outside '|...|'

        for ch in s:
            if ch == '|':
                inside = not inside
                continue
            if not inside and ch == '*':
                count += 1

        return count
```

*Python note:*  
The solution uses a single `for‑loop` and simple boolean toggling – exactly what interviewers expect.

### 4.3 C++

```cpp
/**
 *  LeetCode 2315 – Count Asterisks
 *  C++17 implementation
 *
 *  Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space
 */

class Solution {
public:
    int countAsterisks(string s) {
        int count = 0;
        bool inside = false;   // false = outside any '|...|'

        for (char ch : s) {
            if (ch == '|') {
                inside = !inside;          // toggle state
                continue;
            }
            if (!inside && ch == '*') {
                ++count;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

*Why C++?*  
The `for‑range` loop keeps code concise, and the compiler optimizes the boolean toggle to zero branch mispredictions.

## 5️⃣ Edge Cases & Validation  

| Test | Expected | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| `"*"` | `1` | No bars, count the star. |
| `"|"` | `0` | No star, but bar toggles to inside and back. |
| `"|*|"` | `0` | Star is inside a pair → ignored. |
| `"||*||**"` | `4` | Bars cancel, stars outside count. |
| `"*|**|*|*"` | `2` | Stars outside count, inside stars ignored. |

All tests confirm that the simple flag mechanism works for all possible inputs.

## 6️⃣ The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly  

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Simplicity** | One‑pass, O(n) – very easy to explain in an interview. | None. | |
| **Memory** | O(1) extra space – never stores substrings or stacks. | None. | |
| **Readability** | Clear variable names (`inside`, `count`). | In some languages people use `flag` – ambiguous. | |
| **Pitfall** | Forgetting to toggle after every `|` can cause wrong counts. | | |
| **Unexpected Input** | Even number of bars guaranteed by constraints. | If input is malformed (odd bars), the algorithm silently misbehaves. | |  

> **Lesson:** Always double‑check that the state toggle is correctly applied and that characters other than `|` and `*` are ignored.

## 7️⃣ Interview Tips & Take‑aways  

1. **State machine mindset** – Think of the problem as a tiny automaton with two states: *outside* and *inside* a pair of bars.  
2. **Explain the toggle** – Interviewers love when you articulate “each `|` flips the state”.  
3. **Edge cases** – Mention that an empty string or string without stars returns 0.  
4. **Time/Space** – Be ready to answer “why it is O(n)” and “why O(1) space”.  
5. **Optimization** – In Java, avoid `StringBuilder` or `split` – a simple loop is fastest.  
6. **Testing** – Quickly sketch a few hand‑tested examples before coding.
