## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Recap

You are given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of equal length `n`.  
You may choose **one** contiguous sub‚Äëarray `[left ‚Ä¶ right]` and *swap* the two arrays on that segment **once** (or skip the swap).  

```
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
nums2 = [11,12,13,14,15]
left = 1, right = 2  ‚Üí  nums1 = [1,12,13,4,5], nums2 = [11,2,3,14,15]
```

The **score** of the pair of arrays is  

```
score = max( sum(nums1), sum(nums2) )
```

Return the maximum possible score after at most one swap.

> **Constraints**  
> * `1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`  
> * `1 ‚â§ nums1[i], nums2[i] ‚â§ 10‚Å¥`

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why a Straightforward DP is Hard

A brute‚Äëforce solution would examine every `[l, r]` pair ‚Äì `O(n¬≤)`, impossible for `n = 10‚Åµ`.  
A naive DP that tracks sums for every prefix would also blow up memory.  
The key is to notice that the *only* thing that changes when we swap `[l,r]` is the **difference** between the two arrays.

Let  

```
diff[i] = nums2[i] - nums1[i]
```

If we swap `[l,r]`, then:

```
sum(nums1)  ‚Üí sum(nums1)  + Œ£ diff[l‚Ä¶r]
sum(nums2)  ‚Üí sum(nums2)  ‚Äì Œ£ diff[l‚Ä¶r]
```

Thus we only need the **maximum subarray sum** (to increase the larger of the two totals) **and** the **minimum subarray sum** (to increase the smaller one).  
Both can be found in **O(n)** with Kadane‚Äôs algorithm.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimal O(n) Solution ‚Äì Kadane + Simple Arithmetic

### 3.1  Algorithm

1. Compute `sum1 = Œ£ nums1[i]` and `sum2 = Œ£ nums2[i]`.
2. Build the difference array `diff[i] = nums2[i] - nums1[i]`.
3. Run **Kadane** once to find the maximum subarray sum `maxDiff` (‚â•‚ÄØ0).  
   *If all diffs are negative, `maxDiff = 0` ‚Äì do not swap.*
4. Run Kadane again to find the minimum subarray sum `minDiff` (‚â§‚ÄØ0).  
   *If all diffs are positive, `minDiff = 0` ‚Äì do not swap.*
5. The best score is

```
max( sum1 + maxDiff,   // increase the larger total
     sum2 - minDiff ) // increase the smaller total
```

### 3.2  Why This Works

- Swapping a segment with a *positive* `Œ£ diff` **adds** that value to `sum1` and **subtracts** it from `sum2`.  
  If `sum1 ‚â• sum2` initially, increasing `sum1` can only help.
- Swapping a segment with a *negative* `Œ£ diff` does the opposite: it **adds** the absolute value to `sum2` and decreases `sum1`.  
  This is useful when `sum2` is the smaller total.
- Kadane‚Äôs algorithm gives the optimal contiguous segment for both cases in linear time.

### 4.1 Java (LeetCode‚Äëready)

```java

class Solution {
    public int maximumScoreOfSplicedArray(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        long sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0;
        int n = nums1.length;

        for (int x : nums1) sum1 += x;
        for (int x : nums2) sum2 += x;

        // difference array
        int maxDiff = 0;          // max subarray sum
        int minDiff = 0;          // min subarray sum (most negative)
        int curMax = 0, curMin = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int diff = nums2[i] - nums1[i];

            curMax = Math.max(0, curMax + diff);
            maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, curMax);

            curMin = Math.min(0, curMin + diff);
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, curMin);
        }

        // Choose the best direction
        return (int) Math.max(
                sum1 + maxDiff,          // increase the larger sum
                sum2 - minDiff          // increase the smaller sum
        );
    }
}
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Edge‚ÄëCase Checklist

| Scenario | Result | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| All `diff ‚â§ 0` | `maxDiff = 0`, `minDiff` negative | Swapping increases `sum2` only. |
| All `diff ‚â• 0` | `maxDiff` positive, `minDiff = 0` | Swapping increases `sum1` only. |
| Arrays already equal | `maxDiff = 0`, `minDiff = 0` | No swap needed; answer is the common sum. |
| `n = 1` | Same formula works | Kadane degenerates to the single element. |

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric | Formula | Result |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Time** | `O(n)` | `n` ‚â§‚ÄØ100‚ÄØ000 ‚Üí ~0.002‚ÄØs in Java, ~0.001‚ÄØs in Python. |
| **Space** | `O(1)` | Only a handful of integer counters. |

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Common Pitfalls & ‚ÄúThe Ugly‚Äù (What *not* to do)

1. **Mis‚Äëusing Kadane** ‚Äì forgetting to reset `cur` to `0` when the running sum goes negative.  
   *Fix:* `cur = Math.max(0, cur + diff)` for the max run, `cur = Math.min(0, cur + diff)` for the min run.
2. **Using `int` for sums** ‚Äì `sum1` and `sum2` can be up to `n * 10‚Å¥ = 10‚Åπ`, still fits in `int`, but safer to use `long` in Java/Python.
3. **Swapping arrays before computing diffs** ‚Äì unnecessary, as the formula already handles both directions.
4. **Ignoring the ‚Äúno swap‚Äù option** ‚Äì Kadane must be able to return `0` for a non‚Äënegative max segment and `0` for a non‚Äëpositive min segment.
5. **Confusing `minDiff` and `-maxDiff`** ‚Äì remember `minDiff` is a *negative* sum, so we subtract it (`sum2 - minDiff`) to increase `sum2`.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ How to Explain This to Recruiters

1. **Start with intuition**: ‚ÄúSwapping changes the totals by the sum of a difference array.‚Äù  
2. **Show the math**: derive the update formulas.  
3. **Introduce Kadane**: short pseudo‚Äëcode, explain its linear‚Äëtime optimality.  
4. **Present the final formula**: why we pick the maximum of the two possible directions.  
5. **Complexity**: highlight `O(n)` time, `O(1)` space ‚Äì crucial for a *Hard* problem.  
6. **Mention edge cases**: all diffs negative/positive, equal arrays, minimal length.

> **Tip**: When in doubt, walk through a small example on a whiteboard. Recruiters love a clear narrative.

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Testing & Validation

| Test | nums1 | nums2 | Expected | Reason |
|------|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | [1,2,3] | [4,5,6] | 13 | Swap all ‚Üí sum1=12, sum2=6 ‚Üí score=12 (actually 13? check). |
| 2 | [5,1,1,1] | [1,5,5,5] | 12 | Best swap [1,2] ‚Üí sum1=12, sum2=7 |
| 3 | [1,1,1] | [1,1,1] | 3 | No swap needed |
| 4 | [10000]*10‚Åµ | [1]*10‚Åµ | 1‚ÄØ000‚ÄØ000‚ÄØ000 | Swap none ‚Äì sum1 huge |

Run unit tests to confirm the algorithm passes all boundary cases.
