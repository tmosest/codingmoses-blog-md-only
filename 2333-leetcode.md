## üìå Problem Summary

- **Arrays** `nums1` and `nums2` (length `n`) contain non‚Äënegative integers (`0 ‚Ä¶ 10‚Åµ`).  
- **Operations**:  
  - `k1` times you may increment or decrement any element of `nums1` by `1`.  
  - `k2` times you may do the same for `nums2`.  
- The **sum of squared differences** is  

  \[
  \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\bigl(nums1[i]-nums2[i]\bigr)^2
  \]

- **Goal**: minimise this sum after at most `k1 + k2` total operations.

**Constraints**

| n | 1 ‚Ä¶ 10‚Åµ | k1, k2 | 0 ‚Ä¶ 10‚Åπ | nums[i] | 0 ‚Ä¶ 10‚Åµ |
|---|---------|--------|--------|----------|---------|

## üìà Why This Problem Is a Great Interview Question

| Good | Bad | Ugly |
|------|-----|------|
| ‚úî **Math + Greedy** ‚Äì tests understanding of how operations affect squared differences | ‚ùå **Large constraints** ‚Äì naive `O(n*k)` is impossible | ‚ùå **Off‚Äëby‚Äëone pitfalls** ‚Äì off‚Äëby‚Äë1 errors in diff manipulation |
| ‚úî **Data Structures** ‚Äì frequency array vs. priority queue vs. TreeMap | ‚ùå Requires careful handling of large `k` (up to 10‚Åπ) | ‚ùå Edge cases where all differences become zero early |
| ‚úî **Optimization** ‚Äì `O(n + maxDiff)` is optimal | ‚ùå Needs intuition to see that you always reduce the *largest* difference | ‚ùå Implementation can be over‚Äëengineered (too many data structures) |

## üß† High‚ÄëLevel Algorithm (The ‚ÄúGood‚Äù Way)

1. **Count differences**  
   For each pair `(nums1[i], nums2[i])` compute `d = |nums1[i] - nums2[i]|`.  
   Store how many times each `d` occurs in a frequency array `cnt[d]`.  
   `maxDiff` = largest `d` seen.

2. **Check early termination**  
   If the sum of all differences (`totalDiff`) ‚â§ `k1 + k2`, you can zero out all differences ‚Üí answer is `0`.

3. **Greedy reduction**  
   While we still have operations (`k > 0`), walk from `maxDiff` down to `1`:
   - For each `d`, we can reduce all its occurrences by 1 (moving from `d` to `d-1`) using `cnt[d]` operations.  
   - If `cnt[d] ‚â§ k`, we do it all: `cnt[d-1] += cnt[d]`, `k -= cnt[d]`, `cnt[d] = 0`.  
   - Otherwise we can only reduce `k` of them: `cnt[d] -= k`, `cnt[d-1] += k`, `k = 0`.

4. **Compute final sum**  
   `ans = Œ£ (d¬≤ * cnt[d])`.

**Why greedy works?**  
Reducing the largest current difference always gives the biggest drop in `d¬≤` ‚Üí `f(d) = d¬≤` is strictly convex, so moving a step from `d` to `d-1` gives more benefit than from a smaller `d`. Therefore, we never lose by focusing on the maximum.

## üìä Complexity Analysis

| Step | Complexity |
|------|------------|
| Counting diffs | `O(n)` |
| Greedy loop | `O(maxDiff)` (‚â§ 10‚Åµ) |
| Final sum | `O(maxDiff)` |
| **Total** | `O(n + maxDiff)` time, `O(maxDiff)` space |

Both `maxDiff` and the frequency array fit comfortably in memory (`‚â§ 100‚ÄØ001` integers).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

Below are clean, self‚Äëcontained solutions in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
All codes use the frequency‚Äëarray greedy strategy (no heap needed) and are ready to paste into LeetCode.

### 1. Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public long minSumSquareDiff(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, int k1, int k2) {
        final int MAX = 100_000;               // maximum possible difference
        long[] cnt = new long[MAX + 1];        // frequency of each difference
        long totalDiff = 0;                    // sum of all differences
        int maxDiff = 0;                       // largest difference seen

        // Count differences
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {
            int d = Math.abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);
            if (d == 0) continue;
            cnt[d]++;
            totalDiff += d;
            if (d > maxDiff) maxDiff = d;
        }

        long ops = (long) k1 + k2;              // total operations available
        if (totalDiff <= ops) return 0;        // all differences can be zeroed

        // Greedy reduction from maxDiff downwards
        for (int d = maxDiff; d > 0 && ops > 0; d--) {
            if (cnt[d] == 0) continue;
            if (cnt[d] <= ops) {                // reduce all
                cnt[d - 1] += cnt[d];
                ops -= cnt[d];
                cnt[d] = 0;
            } else {                            // reduce only part
                cnt[d] -= ops;
                cnt[d - 1] += ops;
                ops = 0;
            }
        }

        // Compute final sum of squares
        long ans = 0;
        for (int d = 0; d <= maxDiff; d++) {
            if (cnt[d] > 0) ans += cnt[d] * (long)d * d;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

class Solution:
    def minSumSquareDiff(
        self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], k1: int, k2: int
    ) -> int:
        MAX = 100_000
        cnt = [0] * (MAX + 1)
        total_diff = 0
        max_diff = 0

        # Count differences
        for a, b in zip(nums1, nums2):
            d = abs(a - b)
            if d == 0:
                continue
            cnt[d] += 1
            total_diff += d
            if d > max_diff:
                max_diff = d

        ops = k1 + k2
        if total_diff <= ops:
            return 0

        # Greedy reduction
        for d in range(max_diff, 0, -1):
            if cnt[d] == 0:
                continue
            if cnt[d] <= ops:
                cnt[d - 1] += cnt[d]
                ops -= cnt[d]
                cnt[d] = 0
            else:
                cnt[d] -= ops
                cnt[d - 1] += ops
                ops = 0
                break

        # Final sum of squares
        return sum(c * d * d for d, c in enumerate(cnt))

public:
    long long minSumSquareDiff(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2,
                               int k1, int k2) {
        const int MAX = 100000;
        vector<long long> cnt(MAX + 1, 0);
        long long totalDiff = 0;
        int maxDiff = 0;

        // Count differences
        for (size_t i = 0; i < nums1.size(); ++i) {
            int d = abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);
            if (d == 0) continue;
            cnt[d]++;
            totalDiff += d;

        }

        long long ops = (long long)k1 + k2;
        if (totalDiff <= ops) return 0;

        // Greedy reduction from maxDiff downwards

## üìö Blog Article ‚Äì SEO‚ÄëOptimised Interview Deep‚ÄëDive

> **Target Keywords**: *LeetCode 2333*, *Minimum Sum of Squared Difference*, *array difference optimisation*, *greedy algorithm interview*, *job interview problem*, *coding interview tips*  

### 1. Introduction

> The LeetCode problem **2333 ‚Äì Minimum Sum of Squared Difference** is a staple in technical interviews. It tests a candidate‚Äôs ability to think mathematically, use greedy logic, and optimise for huge input sizes. In this post we walk through the problem from start to finish, deliver production‚Äëready code in three languages, and reveal interview‚Äëwinning tips.

### 2. Problem Statement (in Plain English)

> You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` and two counters `k1`, `k2`. In at most `k1 + k2` moves you may increment or decrement any element of either array by `1`. You need to minimise the sum of squared differences between corresponding elements.  

> **Why it matters:** The problem forces you to see that *one step of an operation has a different impact on `d¬≤` depending on the current value of `d`*. This is the key insight every recruiter wants to test.

### 3. Why It‚Äôs a ‚ÄúGood‚Äù Interview Question

| ‚úÖ What recruiters are looking for | ‚ùå Common pitfalls |
|------------------------------------|--------------------|
| ‚Ä¢ **Greedy + Convexity** ‚Äì convex cost functions mean reducing the largest value gives the greatest benefit. | ‚Ä¢ **Scale** ‚Äì naive `O(n*k)` is impossible; the solution must be linear in `n`. |
| ‚Ä¢ **Frequency array vs. Heap** ‚Äì shows knowledge of low‚Äëmemory, high‚Äëspeed data structures. | ‚Ä¢ **Large `k`** ‚Äì up to `10‚Åπ`. You need to avoid overflow and early‚Äëbreak logic. |
| ‚Ä¢ **Edge‚ÄëCase handling** ‚Äì zeroing all differences early, off‚Äëby‚Äë1 mistakes. | ‚Ä¢ **Complexity** ‚Äì many interviewees write a binary search or BFS that overcomplicates things. |

### 4. The ‚ÄúGood‚Äù Approach ‚Äì Frequency Array + Greedy

1. **Build a frequency table** for the absolute differences (`0 ‚Ä¶ 100‚ÄØ000`).  
2. **If total diff ‚â§ ops** ‚Üí answer is `0`.  
3. **Walk down from the maximum diff**; each time we reduce a bucket of size `d` to `d-1` we use `cnt[d]` operations.  
4. **Compute the final sum** by multiplying each difference squared by its count.

> **Why it‚Äôs optimal:** The function `f(d) = d¬≤` is convex, so the marginal benefit of decreasing a larger `d` is always higher than for a smaller one. Greedy is therefore proven optimal.

### 5. ‚ÄúBad‚Äù or ‚ÄúUgly‚Äù Implementations You Should Avoid

- **Priority Queue Approach**  
  *Works fine but over‚Äëengineers the problem.*  
  Each operation pops the maximum diff, decreases it, and pushes it back. Time complexity `O(n log n)` (still acceptable) but memory overhead and constant factors are higher.

- **TreeMap/Multiset Approach**  
  Useful in languages without a fixed difference range but adds log‚Äëfactor overhead.

- **Two‚ÄëPointer or Binary Search on `k`**  
  A ‚Äútry‚Äëand‚Äëerror‚Äù solution that binary searches the number of operations needed to reach a given threshold. It‚Äôs harder to prove correctness and easier to bug.

### 6. Code Snippets (Java, Python, C++)

*See the code section above for clean implementations. Highlight the use of a simple frequency array and a one‚Äëpass greedy reduction.*

### 7. Interview Tips

| Tip | Explanation |
|-----|-------------|
| **Start with a brute‚Äëforce sketch** ‚Äì then optimise | Helps you catch the intuition behind the convexity of `d¬≤`. |
| **Explain early termination** ‚Äì `totalDiff ‚â§ ops` ‚Üí 0 | Shows you‚Äôre considering edge cases before doing heavy lifting. |
| **Talk about time complexity** ‚Äì `O(n + maxDiff)` | Recruiters love candidates who discuss asymptotics. |
| **Write test cases** ‚Äì zero differences, all differences same, `k = 0` | Guarantees your solution is bullet‚Äëproof. |

### 8. Conclusion

> The **Minimum Sum of Squared Difference** is a classic LeetCode interview problem that blends mathematics, greedy strategy, and careful handling of large `k`. By mastering this solution, you‚Äôll demonstrate the skills recruiters value: *clean thinking, optimal data‚Äëstructure choice, and robust coding under constraints.*
