        # 🚀 LeetCode 2357 – “Make Array Zero by Subtracting Equal Amounts”  
### The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly – All in One Blog Post

> **Why read this?**  
> If you’re eyeing a **software‑engineering interview** (Google, Amazon, FAANG, or any hiring manager), this post gives you a clean, **time‑O(n)** solution, the *why* behind it, and a polished **blog‑ready** write‑up that you can paste into your portfolio or LinkedIn.

## 1. Problem Recap

> **Problem** – `minimumOperations(int[] nums)`  
> You’re given a non‑negative integer array `nums`.  
> In one operation you can:

1. Choose a positive integer `x` that is **≤ the smallest non‑zero element** in `nums`.  
2. Subtract `x` from every positive element of `nums`.  

> **Goal** – Return the *minimum* number of operations to turn every element to zero.

> **Examples**

| Input | Output | Reasoning |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| `[1,5,0,3,5]` | `3` | Distinct positives: `{1,3,5}` → 3 ops |
| `[0]` | `0` | Already zero |

**Constraints**  
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`  
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

---

## 2. The “Good” – A One‑Line Insight

> **Key Observation**  
> Each *distinct* positive number will be the *smallest non‑zero* value at some point.  
> When it is chosen as `x`, at least one new element becomes zero.  
> Therefore, **the minimum number of operations equals the number of distinct positive values**.

> **Why this works**  
> - We never need more than one operation per unique positive value.  
> - We cannot finish earlier: a new distinct positive value cannot become zero without being the smallest at least once.

**Complexity**  
- `Time  : O(n)` – single scan of the array.  
- `Space : O(n)` – in the worst case a hash‑set of all unique positives.

---

## 3. The “Bad” – A Simulated, Quadratic Approach

```text
while (array has positives)
    choose x = min(non‑zero)
    subtract x from every positive
```

*This naive simulation is easy to write but runs in `O(n²)` time (worst case 100×100).  
It’s a great “teach‑your‑self” experiment, but not interview‑ready.*

---

## 4. The “Ugly” – Over‑Engineered Variants

- **PriorityQueue + Re‑building**: Keep a PQ of positives, pop the min, subtract, rebuild the PQ.  
  Still `O(n log n)` per operation – unnecessary overhead.

- **Bitmask or Boolean array**: Works for small value ranges but still clunky; not the most expressive.

---

## 5. Clean, Idiomatic Solutions

Below are three implementations (Java, Python, C++) that use the optimal “distinct positives” idea.  
Each snippet is ready to paste into LeetCode or your own IDE.

### 5.1 Java

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int minimumOperations(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> distinct = new HashSet<>();
        for (int v : nums) {
            if (v > 0) distinct.add(v);
        }
        return distinct.size();
    }
}
```

> **Why HashSet?**  
> *O(1)* average insertion and lookup; handles up to 100 distinct values comfortably.

---

### 5.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return len({x for x in nums if x > 0})
```

> **Set Comprehension**  
> Reads in a single line and is instantly clear to interviewers.

---

### 5.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> uniq;
        for (int v : nums)
            if (v > 0) uniq.insert(v);
        return uniq.size();
    }
};
```

> **unordered_set** gives average‑case `O(1)` operations; perfect for the 100‑element constraint.

---

## 6. Edge Cases & Validation

| Edge Case | Expected Result | Why |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| All zeros | `0` | No positive values to process. |
| One element, non‑zero | `1` | Distinct positives = 1. |
| Repeated values | `1` | Example `[3,3,3]` → one operation. |
| Mixed zeros and positives | count positives | Zeros are ignored. |

---

## 7. Interview Tips

1. **State the observation** first.  
   “If you look at the operation, every distinct positive number becomes the smallest at least once.”  
   This instantly shows you understand the problem.

2. **Discuss complexity** immediately.  
   Show you’re thinking about efficiency.

3. **Mention alternatives** briefly.  
   “A simulation would be `O(n²)` and is unnecessary.”  
   Interviewers appreciate awareness of trade‑offs.

4. **Write clean code**.  
   Use meaningful names (`distinct`, `uniq`) and avoid extra loops.

## 9. Final Takeaway

The *good* part of this problem is its elegant solution: **count distinct positives**.  
The *bad* part is any attempt to simulate the process.  
The *ugly* part is over‑engineering with heaps or bitmasks.

Armed with this understanding, you can confidently discuss the problem in any interview and write production‑ready code in any language.

Happy coding, and good luck on your next interview! 🚀
