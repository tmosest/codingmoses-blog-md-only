## 1.  Quick‑Start Code Snippets

| Language | Implementation | Time | Space |
|----------|----------------|------|-------|
| **Java** | ```java
public class Solution {
    public int minimumOperations(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        for (int v : nums) {
            if (v > 0) seen.add(v);
        }
        return seen.size();
    }
}
``` | O(n) | O(n) |
| **Python** | ```python
class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return len({v for v in nums if v > 0})
``` | O(n) | O(n) |
| **C++** | ```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> seen;
        for (int v : nums)
            if (v > 0) seen.insert(v);
        return seen.size();
    }
};
``` | O(n) | O(n) |

> **Why this works** – Each *distinct* positive value in the array will be the smallest non‑zero element exactly once.  
> Subtracting it will zero‑out at least one element, and the process repeats.  
> Hence the minimum number of operations equals the number of unique positive values.

### Title  
**“Make Array Zero by Subtracting Equal Amounts – The One‑Line Solution That Wins Interviews”**

---

### Introduction  

If you’re preparing for a coding interview or polishing your LeetCode skills, you’ll encounter **Problem 2357 – Make Array Zero by Subtracting Equal Amounts**.  
It looks tricky at first glance, but the solution is a *single set operation* once you see the insight.  
In this article we’ll dissect the problem, show the “good, the bad, and the ugly” of common approaches, and give you a polished, ready‑to‑copy Java, Python, and C++ solution that you can confidently submit.

---

### Problem Recap  

> **Given** an array `nums` of non‑negative integers.  
> **Operation**:  
> 1. Pick a positive integer `x` ≤ smallest non‑zero element in `nums`.  
> 2. Subtract `x` from *every* positive element.  
> **Goal**: Find the minimum number of operations needed to turn every element into `0`.

**Constraints**  
- `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 100`  
- `0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100`

---

### 1.  The “Good” – Intuition & Observation  

1. **The smallest non‑zero element is always chosen** – because any larger `x` would violate the rule `x ≤ minPositive`.  
2. **Every distinct positive number will become the smallest at least once**.  
   *Why?* When the current smallest positive `s` is subtracted, all elements that were equal to `s` become `0`, and every other positive element decreases by `s`.  
   The new smallest positive element is the next distinct value in the sorted order.  
3. **Each distinct value guarantees at least one operation** – it’s the moment we zero out the first occurrence of that value.

**Result:**  
The minimum number of operations equals the count of *unique* positive values in the array.

---

### 2.  The “Bad” – Naïve Simulation  

A common but inefficient approach is to simulate the process:

```python
def bad(nums):
    ops = 0
    while any(v > 0 for v in nums):
        smallest = min(v for v in nums if v > 0)
        for i, v in enumerate(nums):
            if v > 0:
                nums[i] -= smallest
        ops += 1
    return ops
```

*Drawbacks*  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * ops) – up to O(n²) because `ops` can be as large as the number of distinct values.  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) but the heavy loops make it slow on larger inputs.  
- **Hard to read** – The algorithmic insight is hidden under nested loops.

---

### 3.  The “Ugly” – Sorting & Manual Deduplication  

Another angle: sort the array and count changes:

```cpp
int ugly(vector<int> nums) {
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int ops = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (nums[i] > 0 && (i == 0 || nums[i] != nums[i-1]))
            ++ops;
    }
    return ops;
}
```

*Issues*  
- **Sorting overhead** – O(n log n) when the answer is O(n).  
- **Risk of integer overflow** – not a problem here, but extra caution is needed in other contexts.  
- **More code** – Less elegant than a simple set.

---

### 4.  The Clean Solution – Using a Set  

The elegant, O(n) solution relies on a set to collect unique positives:

| Language | Core Idea | Code |
|----------|-----------|------|
| **Java** | `HashSet<Integer>` to store distinct values | `Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>(); for (int v: nums) if (v>0) seen.add(v); return seen.size();` |
| **Python** | `set` comprehension | `return len({v for v in nums if v>0})` |
| **C++** | `unordered_set<int>` | `unordered_set<int> seen; for (int v: nums) if (v>0) seen.insert(v); return seen.size();` |

**Why it’s optimal**

- **Linear time** – One pass over the array.  
- **Constant extra memory** (bounded by 101 unique values) – Even better than the theoretical O(n).  
- **Readable** – The code expresses the mathematical insight directly.

---

### 5.  Complexity Analysis  

| Measure | Java / Python / C++ |
|---------|---------------------|
| Time | O(n) – single scan |
| Space | O(min(n, 101)) – at most 101 integers (since `nums[i] ≤ 100`) |

---

### 6.  Edge Cases & Testing  

| Test | Input | Expected | Reason |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | `[0]` | `0` | No positive numbers |
| 2 | `[1, 1, 1]` | `1` | Only one distinct positive |
| 3 | `[5, 3, 5, 0, 3]` | `2` | Distinct positives `{3,5}` |
| 4 | `[0, 0, 0]` | `0` | All zeros |
| 5 | `[100, 0, 50, 25, 50]` | `3` | `{25,50,100}` |

---

### 7.  Interview Tips  

1. **Explain the insight** – “Each distinct positive value requires its own operation because it becomes the smallest once.”  
2. **Show a counter‑example** for naïve simulation – highlight why it’s unnecessary.  
3. **Mention constraints** – With `nums[i] ≤ 100`, a boolean array of size 101 is a valid O(1) space alternative.  
4. **Time/space trade‑offs** – If memory is critical, use a fixed‑size boolean array instead of a hash set.  

---

### 8.  Takeaway  

The “Make Array Zero” LeetCode problem is a perfect illustration of how a simple mathematical observation can collapse a seemingly iterative process into a single, set‑based operation.  
Mastering this trick not only gives you an *efficient* solution but also shows interviewers that you can spot patterns and simplify algorithms – a highly prized skill in software development.

Happy coding, and good luck landing that next job interview! 🚀
