        # 2374 – Node With Highest Edge Score  
**A LeetCode “Medium” problem solved in Java, Python, & C++ + a full SEO‑friendly blog post**

---

## 🚀 TL;DR  
- **Goal:** Find the node that receives the largest *edge score* (sum of incoming node labels).  
- **Input:** `int[] edges` where `edges[i]` is the destination of the single outgoing edge from node `i`.  
- **Output:** Index of the node with the highest edge score (smallest index if tied).  
- **Complexity:** `O(n)` time, `O(n)` extra space.  
- **Why it matters:** Demonstrates graph‑indegree counting, 64‑bit safety, and clean one‑pass solutions—great interview talking‑points for a backend/data‑engineering role.  

---

## 📌 Problem Recap  

> **Node With Highest Edge Score**  
> You are given a directed graph with `n` nodes (`0 … n-1`).  
> Every node has exactly one outgoing edge, given by the array `edges`.  
> The *edge score* of node `i` is the sum of the labels of all nodes that point to `i`.  
> Return the node with the highest edge score; if multiple nodes tie, return the smallest index.  

### Example  

```text
edges = [1,0,0,0,0,7,7,5]
Output: 7
```

- Node 0 receives edges from 1,2,3,4 → score = 1+2+3+4 = 10  
- Node 5 receives edge from 7 → score = 7  
- Node 7 receives edges from 5,6 → score = 5+6 = 11 (max)  

---

## 🛠️ High‑Level Solution  

1. **Traverse once** over `edges`.  
2. For each `i`, add `i` to the score of the node `edges[i]`.  
3. Keep track of the maximum score and its node index while updating.  
4. Return the node with the highest score (tie → smaller index).  

Because the sum of indices can reach ~`n*(n-1)/2` (≈ 5 × 10⁹ for `n = 10⁵`), use **64‑bit integers** (`long` in Java & C++, `int64`/`long` in Python) to avoid overflow.

## 🔧 Code Solutions

### Java

```java
// 2374. Node With Highest Edge Score
// Java 17 – One‑pass O(n) solution

public class Solution {
    public int edgeScore(int[] edges) {
        int n = edges.length;
        long[] score = new long[n];          // 64‑bit to avoid overflow
        int bestNode = 0;
        long bestScore = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int to = edges[i];
            score[to] += i;                  // add incoming node label

            if (score[to] > bestScore || 
               (score[to] == bestScore && to < bestNode)) {
                bestScore = score[to];
                bestNode = to;
            }
        }
        return bestNode;
    }
}
```

> **Key take‑away:**  
> *Use a raw array instead of a `HashMap` for O(1) lookups; keep a running best to avoid a second scan.*

---

### Python

```python
# 2374. Node With Highest Edge Score
# Python 3 – One‑pass O(n) solution

def edgeScore(edges):
    n = len(edges)
    score = [0] * n          # list of ints, 64‑bit on CPython
    best_node = 0
    best_score = 0

    for i, to in enumerate(edges):
        score[to] += i
        if score[to] > best_score or (score[to] == best_score and to < best_node):
            best_score = score[to]
            best_node = to

    return best_node
```

> **Why list over `defaultdict`:**  
> The index space is already known (`0 … n-1`), so a list gives O(1) access and no hashing overhead.

---

### C++

```cpp
// 2374. Node With Highest Edge Score
// C++17 – One‑pass O(n) solution

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int edgeScore(vector<int>& edges) {
        int n = edges.size();
        vector<long long> score(n, 0);   // 64‑bit
        int bestNode = 0;
        long long bestScore = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int to = edges[i];
            score[to] += i;
            if (score[to] > bestScore || (score[to] == bestScore && to < bestNode)) {
                bestScore = score[to];
                bestNode = to;
            }
        }
        return bestNode;
    }
};
```

> **Take‑away:**  
> Use `long long` for safety; the rest is identical to Java/Python.

## 📈 Complexity Analysis  

| Approach | Time | Space | Why it matters |
|----------|------|-------|----------------|
| One‑pass array | **O(n)** | **O(n)** | Each edge processed once; score array size = `n`. |
| Two‑pass (first compute scores, second find max) | **O(n)** | **O(n)** | Same asymptotic cost, but two loops; less efficient but still fine for `n ≤ 10⁵`. |
| HashMap (Java) / unordered_map (C++) | **O(n)** average | **O(n)** | Adds hashing overhead; not needed because index range is contiguous. |

All solutions run comfortably within LeetCode’s limits.

---

## 🎯 What Makes This Problem “Nice” for Interviews

1. **Graph fundamentals** – Indegree counting, edge traversal.  
2. **Edge‑case handling** – 64‑bit overflow, ties by index.  
3. **One‑pass optimality** – Show you can design linear‑time algorithms.  
4. **Language‑agnostic patterns** – Same algorithm works in Java, Python, C++, Go, etc.  

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls (“The Ugly”)

| Pitfall | Explanation | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Using `int` for scores | Sum can exceed `2^31‑1`. | Use `long` / `long long`. |
| Re‑scanning for maximum after building the score array | Still O(n), but unnecessary overhead. | Keep running max while building. |
| Using a `HashMap` for a dense index range | Adds hashing cost. | Use a plain array (`int[]`, `long[]`). |
| Not handling ties | Interviewers expect smallest index if scores tie. | Compare `to < bestNode` when scores equal. |

---

## 🧩 Real‑world Analogies

- **Load‑balancing servers** – Nodes represent servers; each request (incoming edge) contributes its *request ID* (index) to a server’s load.  
- **Social network** – Edge score is like the *sum of follower IDs* pointing to a user.  

These analogies help recruiters see your problem‑solving mindset beyond coding.

### 1️⃣ What the Problem Is About  

LeetCode 2374 challenges you to work on a **directed graph** where every node has **exactly one outgoing edge**.  
The twist: you’re not looking for the *reach* of a node but its **edge score** – the sum of the indices of all nodes that point to it.  
If two nodes have the same score, you return the one with the smaller index.

---

### 2️⃣ The “Good” – Why This Problem Is a Masterclass

| Feature | Why It’s Good |
|---------|---------------|
| **Classic graph indegree counting** | Reinforces fundamentals that are used in routing, social‑graph analytics, and compiler passes. |
| **Linear‑time solution** | Shows you can design optimal algorithms – a key interview trait. |
| **Overflow Awareness** | Forces you to consider numeric limits – a subtle but essential production‑grade detail. |
| **One‑pass elegance** | Demonstrates that you can combine data accumulation and result extraction in a single loop. |
| **Language‑agnostic** | The same algorithm works in Java, Python, C++, Go, Rust – great for technical recruiters who value cross‑platform skills. |

---

### 3️⃣ The “Bad” – Things That Make the Problem Harder Than It Looks

1. **Large input size (`n ≤ 100 000`)**  
   - You must keep the solution linear; O(n²) hacks will time‑out.  
2. **Score Overflow**  
   - The sum of indices can reach ≈ 5 × 10⁹ – requires 64‑bit arithmetic.  
3. **Tie‑breaking Rule**  
   - “Smallest index if tied” can trip up naïve max‑finding logic.  

---

### 4️⃣ The “Ugly” – Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | Why It Happens | Real‑World Fix |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Using `int` for scores | Overlooks the 5 × 10⁹ upper bound | Switch to `long` (`Java`) / `long long` (`C++`) / 64‑bit `int` (`Python`). |
| Re‑computing the max in a second loop | Adds extra passes, but still O(n) | Keep a running maximum while building the score array. |
| Using a HashMap/HashTable | Adds unnecessary hashing overhead when indices are contiguous | Use a raw array (`int[]`, `long[]`). |
| Ignoring the tie rule | Returns the wrong node on equal scores | Add `and to < bestNode` to the comparison. |

---

### 5️⃣ Step‑by‑Step Walk‑Through (Java)

```java
int bestNode = 0;          // answer candidate
long bestScore = 0;        // current maximum score

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int to = edges[i];
    score[to] += i;        // accumulate incoming label

    // Update best if we found a higher score or the same score but a smaller index
    if (score[to] > bestScore || (score[to] == bestScore && to < bestNode)) {
        bestScore = score[to];
        bestNode = to;
    }
}
return bestNode;
```

> **Why `score[to] += i`?**  
> `i` is the label of the incoming node. Adding it directly to the destination node’s score implements the definition of *edge score* in O(1).

---

### 6️⃣ Real‑World Analogies (To Use in Your Interview)

- **Load Balancer** – Servers = nodes, requests = edges. Each request contributes its ID to a server’s “load”.  
- **Social Media** – Users = nodes, “follow” relationships = edges. The *score* is like “influencer popularity” (sum of follower IDs).  

These analogies help recruiters relate the algorithm to business problems.

---

### 7️⃣ Summary & Take‑Away

- **Problem:** Compute indegree‑based scores in a graph with one outgoing edge per node.  
- **Solution:** One linear pass with a 64‑bit score array + running maximum.  
- **Why recruiters love it:**  
  1. Graph basics + edge‑case handling.  
  2. Demonstrates attention to numeric limits.  
  3. Shows mastery of language‑agnostic data structures.  

> **Pro tip:** Bring up “one‑pass optimality” and the 64‑bit safety in your next interview; it’s a quick way to showcase both algorithmic thinking and production awareness.
