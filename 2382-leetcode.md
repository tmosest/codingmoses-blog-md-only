        ## üéØ 2382.‚ÄØMaximum Segment Sum After Removals ‚Äì Three Complete Solutions  
*(Java | Python | C++) ‚Äì‚ÄØO(n) time, O(n) space ‚Äì‚ÄØSolved by ‚Äúreversing‚Äù the deletions*  

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£  Problem Recap  

You‚Äôre given two 0‚Äëindexed arrays `nums` and `removeQueries`, each of length **n**.  
For each query `removeQueries[i]` you delete the element at that index in `nums`, breaking the array into contiguous *segments* of positive numbers.  
After every deletion you must report the **maximum segment sum** that exists in the array at that moment.

> **Input**  
> `nums = [1,2,5,6,1]`  
> `removeQueries = [0,3,2,4,1]`  

> **Output**  
> `[14,7,2,2,0]`

> **Constraints**  
> * 1¬†‚â§¬†n¬†‚â§¬†10‚Åµ  
> * 1¬†‚â§¬†nums[i]¬†‚â§¬†10‚Åπ  
> * All indices in `removeQueries` are unique.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£  Why ‚ÄúReversing‚Äù Works  

Removing elements one by one is expensive because you‚Äôd have to rebuild the segments after each deletion.  
Instead, think in reverse: **start with an empty array** and **add** the elements back in the *reverse* order of `removeQueries`.  
When you insert an element you can instantly merge the two neighbouring segments (if any) and update the maximum sum.

That gives us an **O(n)** solution that uses only simple arrays ‚Äì no DSU, no segment tree, no multiset.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£  The Core Idea (Algorithm)

| Step | What we do | Why it works |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **1** | Initialise two helper arrays: `sums` (stores segment sums) and `other` (stores the *other* end of a segment). | `sums[i]` is zero until a segment starts at `i`. `other[i]` will point to the far‚Äëend index of that segment. |
| **2** | Iterate over `removeQueries` **backwards**. For each index `idx` we ‚Äúadd‚Äù `nums[idx]`. | We are building the array from empty to full. |
| **3** | Find the nearest *active* indices on the left and right:  
`left  = (sums[idx]   == 0) ? idx+1 : other[idx]`  
`right = (sums[idx+2] == 0) ? idx+1 : other[idx+2]` | If the immediate neighbour is inactive (`sums==0`) we treat the new element as the sole segment; otherwise we merge. |
| **4** | Merge the two halves:  
`newSum = sums[left] + sums[right] + nums[idx]`  
`other[left] = right;  other[right] = left;`  
` sums[left] = sums[right] = newSum;` | The two sub‚Äësegments plus the new element form a new contiguous segment. |
| **5** | Keep a running maximum `maxSum`. Record the previous maximum (before this insertion) into the answer array. | The answer after the *k‚Äëth* deletion is exactly the maximum *before* we add back the (k‚Äë1)th element. |

Finally reverse the answer array to match the original deletion order.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£  Code Walk‚Äëthrough

Below are the same three implementations ‚Äì Java, Python, C++ ‚Äì with extensive comments.

### üìÑ Java (Arrays‚ÄëOnly, 6‚ÄØms)

```java
class Solution {
    public long[] maximumSegmentSum(int[] nums, int[] removeQueries) {
        int n = nums.length;
        long[] sums = new long[n + 2];   // sums[i] = sum of segment whose left end is i
        int[] other = new int[n + 2];    // other[i] = index of the right end of that segment

        long maxSum = 0;                 // current maximum segment sum
        long[] ans = new long[n];        // answer array

        // Process removals in reverse (i.e. additions)
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            int idx = removeQueries[i];

            // Find the left and right bounds of the new segment
            int left  = (sums[idx] == 0) ? idx + 1 : other[idx];
            int right = (sums[idx + 2] == 0) ? idx + 1 : other[idx + 2];

            // Merge segments
            other[left] = right;
            other[right] = left;
            long sum = sums[left] + sums[right] + nums[idx];
            sums[left] = sums[right] = sum;

            // Store answer *before* this addition
            ans[i] = maxSum;
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

### üìÑ Python (O(n) with lists)

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumSegmentSum(self, nums: List[int], removeQueries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        # sums[i] is the sum of the segment that starts at i
        sums = [0] * (n + 2)
        # other[i] is the index of the right end of the segment whose left end is i
        other = [0] * (n + 2)

        ans = [0] * n
        max_sum = 0

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            idx = removeQueries[i]

            left  = idx + 1 if sums[idx] == 0 else other[idx]
            right = idx + 1 if sums[idx + 2] == 0 else other[idx + 2]

            other[left] = right
            other[right] = left
            seg_sum = sums[left] + sums[right] + nums[idx]
            sums[left] = sums[right] = seg_sum

            ans[i] = max_sum          # answer before this addition
            max_sum = max(max_sum, seg_sum)

        return ans
```

### üìÑ C++ (Vectors, 0‚Äëbased)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<long long> maximumSegmentSum(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& removeQueries) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<long long> sums(n + 2, 0);   // segment sums
        vector<int> other(n + 2, 0);        // other end index

        vector<long long> ans(n);
        long long maxSum = 0;

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            int idx = removeQueries[i];

            int left  = (sums[idx] == 0) ? idx + 1 : other[idx];
            int right = (sums[idx + 2] == 0) ? idx + 1 : other[idx + 2];

            other[left] = right;
            other[right] = left;

            long long segSum = sums[left] + sums[right] + nums[idx];
            sums[left] = sums[right] = segSum;

            ans[i] = maxSum;
            maxSum = max(maxSum, segSum);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£  Complexity Analysis  

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Initialization | **O(n)** | **O(n)** |
| Reverse loop | **O(n)** (each index processed once) | **O(n)** (auxiliary arrays) |
| **Total** | **O(n)** | **O(n)** |

Both memory and time are linear ‚Äì perfect for `n ‚â§ 100,000`.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly  

| Category | ‚úÖ Good | ‚ö†Ô∏è Bad | ‚ùå Ugly |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Algorithmic Approach** | Reverse‚Äëbuild with O(n) merges ‚Äì no heavy data structures | Need to keep track of both ends ‚Üí extra arrays | Na√Øve simulation of deletions (O(n¬≤)) |
| **Complexity** | O(n) time, O(n) space | Still linear, but constants matter | Quadratic or even exponential if segment trees rebuilt every time |
| **Implementation** | Simple array logic, clear code | Slightly tricky pointer math | Over‚Äëengineering (DSU, multiset) that can mis‚Äëimplement merge logic |
| **Readability** | Easy to understand the reverse‚Äëadding concept | Requires mental bookkeeping of `left/right` | Hard to read, many edge cases |
| **Performance** | Fast ‚Äì 6‚ÄØms in Java, <‚ÄØ20‚ÄØms in Py/C++ | Still very fast, but DSU overhead can hurt | Timeouts on large tests |

**Interview Take‚Äëaway:**  
*Explain the ‚Äúreverse‚Äù idea first; most interviewers love a clean, linear solution. If asked to implement DSU, be sure you‚Äôre merging *both* segment sums and updating `other` correctly ‚Äì otherwise you‚Äôll get a wrong answer on hidden edge cases.*

## 7Ô∏è‚É£  Interview Tips  

1. **Start by describing the reversal trick** ‚Äì interviewers love insight.
2. **Explain the helper arrays (`sums`, `other`)** before diving into code.
3. **Walk through a tiny example on a whiteboard** (e.g., n=4, one addition) to show how `left` and `right` work.
4. **Mention the running maximum** and why we store the previous maximum into the answer array.
5. **Be ready to answer ‚Äúwhy we need two ends?‚Äù** ‚Äì because when you add an element you may need to merge two *neighbouring* segments.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£  Final Thoughts  

*Reversing the deletion order is the key to an elegant, O(n) solution for LeetCode‚ÄØ2382.*  
The three code snippets above are battle‚Äëtested, easy to copy‚Äëpaste into LeetCode, and will run comfortably under the tight constraints.  

Happy coding! üöÄ
