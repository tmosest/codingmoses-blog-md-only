        ## üéØ Problem Overview ‚Äì LeetCode¬†2397: ‚ÄúMaximum Rows Covered by Columns‚Äù

| **ID** | **Name** | **Difficulty** |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| 2397 | Maximum Rows Covered by Columns | Medium |

**Statement**

Given an `m √ó n` binary matrix `matrix` and an integer `numSelect`, pick **exactly** `numSelect` distinct columns so that the number of *covered* rows is maximised.

* A row is **covered** if **every** `1` in that row lies in a column you have selected.  
* If a row contains **no** `1` it is automatically covered.

Return the maximum possible number of covered rows.



**Example**

```text
matrix = [[0,0,0],
          [1,0,1],
          [0,1,1],
          [0,0,1]],  numSelect = 2
```

Choose columns `{0, 2}` ‚Üí rows 0, 1, and 3 are covered ‚Üí answer `3`.



**Constraints**

* `1 ‚â§ m, n ‚â§ 12`
* `matrix[i][j] ‚àà {0, 1}`
* `1 ‚â§ numSelect ‚â§ n`



--------------------------------------------------------------------

## üöÄ How We Solve It

The constraints are tiny (`n ‚â§ 12`).  
That means we can afford to explore all `2‚Åø` column subsets (‚âà 4096 at most).  
The key insight: for a fixed subset of columns we can count covered rows in *O(m ¬∑ n)*, so overall complexity is about `O(2‚Åø ¬∑ m ¬∑ n)` ‚Äì easily fast enough.

We‚Äôll present **three** idiomatic implementations:

1. **Bit‚Äëmask enumeration** (C++ & Python)
2. **Backtracking with pruning** (Java)
3. **Recursive ‚Äúpick / not‚Äëpick‚Äù** (Python ‚Äì a more educational view)

All three use the same logic, just different styles.



--------------------------------------------------------------------

## üß† 1Ô∏è‚É£ Bit‚ÄëMask Enumeration (Python & C++)

```python
# Python 3
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maximumRows(self, matrix: List[List[int]], numSelect: int) -> int:
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        max_rows = 0

        # iterate over all column subsets of size numSelect
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            if bin(mask).count("1") != numSelect:
                continue

            rows_covered = 0
            for r in range(m):
                covered = True
                for c in range(n):
                    if matrix[r][c] == 1 and not (mask >> c) & 1:
                        covered = False
                        break
                if covered:
                    rows_covered += 1
            max_rows = max(max_rows, rows_covered)
        return max_rows
```

```cpp
// C++17
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumRows(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int numSelect) {
        int m = matrix.size(), n = matrix[0].size();
        int best = 0;
        for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
            if (__builtin_popcount(mask) != numSelect) continue;
            int covered = 0;
            for (int r = 0; r < m; ++r) {
                bool ok = true;
                for (int c = 0; c < n; ++c) {
                    if (matrix[r][c] == 1 && !(mask & (1 << c))) {
                        ok = false; break;
                    }
                }
                if (ok) ++covered;
            }
            best = max(best, covered);
        }
        return best;
    }
};
```

### Why it‚Äôs fast

* `1 << n` is at most `4096`.  
* Each subset is evaluated with two nested loops (`m √ó n ‚â§ 144`).  
* Total operations ‚âà `4096 √ó 144 ‚âà 6¬∑10‚Åµ` ‚Äì trivial for a 1‚ÄØs limit.



--------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîé 2Ô∏è‚É£ Java Backtracking with Pruning

```java
// Java 17
class Solution {
    private int m, n, cols;
    private List<int[]> rows;            // each row as an int bitset
    private int best;

    public int maximumRows(int[][] matrix, int numSelect) {
        m = matrix.length;
        n = matrix[0].length;
        cols = numSelect;

        // Convert rows to bitsets ‚Äì makes row checking O(1)
        rows = new ArrayList<>(m);
        for (int[] row : matrix) {
            int bits = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) if (row[i] == 1) bits |= 1 << i;
            rows.add(new int[]{bits});
        }

        best = 0;
        dfs(0, 0, 0);
        return best;
    }

    // backtrack over column indices
    private void dfs(int idx, int chosen, int mask) {
        // prune: impossible to reach best if we can't pick enough columns
        if (chosen + (n - idx) < cols) return;

        if (idx == n) {
            // all columns processed ‚Äì count covered rows
            int covered = 0;
            for (int[] r : rows) {
                if ((r[0] & ~mask) == 0) covered++;   // all 1's are inside mask
            }
            best = Math.max(best, covered);
            return;
        }

        // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Pick this column (if we still need more)
        if (chosen < cols) dfs(idx + 1, chosen + 1, mask | (1 << idx));

        // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Skip this column
        dfs(idx + 1, chosen, mask);
    }
}
```

### Why this style is handy

* Uses recursion only once (pick / not‚Äëpick) ‚Äì easy to understand for interviewers.
* `mask` is built incrementally; no need to recompute popcount for every subset.
* The pruning check `chosen + (n-idx) < cols` cuts away a lot of dead branches.



--------------------------------------------------------------------

## üéì 3Ô∏è‚É£ Recursive ‚ÄúPick / Not‚ÄëPick‚Äù (Python ‚Äì Educational)

```python
# Python 3 ‚Äì very explicit pick/not‚Äëpick recursion
class Solution:
    def maximumRows(self, matrix, numSelect):
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        best = 0

        def helper(col_idx, picked, mask):
            nonlocal best
            # base case: all columns considered
            if col_idx == n:
                if picked != numSelect: return
                rows_covered = 0
                for r in range(m):
                    if (mask >> r) & 1 == 0:    # row has no 1s at all
                        rows_covered += 1
                    else:
                        # check if all 1's in this row are in selected columns
                        ok = True
                        for c in range(n):
                            if matrix[r][c] == 1 and not (mask >> c) & 1:
                                ok = False; break
                        if ok: rows_covered += 1
                best = max(best, rows_covered)
                return

            # option 1: pick this column
            if picked < numSelect:
                helper(col_idx + 1, picked + 1, mask | (1 << col_idx))

            # option 2: skip this column
            helper(col_idx + 1, picked, mask)

        helper(0, 0, 0)
        return best
```

*This implementation is essentially the same as the bit‚Äëmask one but written in a purely recursive style.  
It is useful to illustrate the ‚Äúchoice‚Äù reasoning to interviewers.*

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìä Complexity Analysis

| Implementation | Time | Space |
|----------------|------|-------|
| Bit‚Äëmask enumeration | **O( 2‚Åø ¬∑ m ¬∑ n )**   (‚âà 4096 √ó 144 ‚âà 6√ó10‚Åµ ops) | **O(1)** (apart from input) |
| Backtracking | **O( C(n, numSelect) ¬∑ m ¬∑ n )** | **O(n)** (call stack + mask) |
| Recursive pick | same as backtracking | same as backtracking |

All are *exponential in `n`*, but with `n ‚â§ 12` they run in <‚ÄØ5‚ÄØms on modern hardware.



--------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚öñÔ∏è The Good / Bad / Ugly Parts

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Correctness** | ‚úîÔ∏è Straightforward definition of a covered row | ‚ùå A na√Øve solution might *mistake* rows with no 1s for ‚Äúuncovered‚Äù | üö´ Forgetting the ‚Äúno‚Äë1 row is automatically covered‚Äù rule leads to wrong answers. |
| **Complexity** | Exponential but feasible for tiny `n` | ‚úîÔ∏è Bit operations make it *fast* | ‚ùå Bruteforce over *all* `2‚Åø` subsets when `numSelect` is small (e.g. 1) ‚Üí unnecessary work. |
| **Readability** | ‚úîÔ∏è Clear bit‚Äëmask loop | ‚ùå Deep recursion with many flags can be hard to follow | ‚ùå No comments ‚Üí hard to debug. |
| **Extensibility** | ‚úîÔ∏è Replace matrix with any boolean array easily | ‚ùå Harder to switch to another language without re‚Äëwriting recursion | ‚ùå Recursion depth may hit Python‚Äôs limit for larger `n` (not a problem here, but still). |

> **Takeaway** ‚Äì With small constraints a brute‚Äëforce enumeration is the *cleanest* and least error‚Äëprone solution.  
> When preparing for interviews, be ready to explain why `n ‚â§ 12` makes this feasible, and highlight that a simple bit‚Äëmask loop is both **time‚Äëefficient** and **space‚Äëlight**.

### 1. Introduction

If you‚Äôre polishing your interview stack for software engineering roles, **LeetCode 2397** is a must‚Äëknow problem. It tests both your understanding of combinatorics (choosing columns) and your ability to work efficiently with bit masks or recursion.

In this post we‚Äôll walk through the problem, give a *clear* solution in three languages, and explain why this is a great talking point in any coding interview.

> **Keywords:** Leetcode 2397, Maximum Rows Covered by Columns, interview question, Java solution, Python solution, C++ solution, backtracking, bitmask, job interview coding.



### 2. Problem Restatement

We have a binary matrix `matrix[m][n]` and a number `numSelect`.  
Choose **exactly** `numSelect` columns; a row is *covered* if every `1` in that row is in one of the chosen columns.  
Return the maximal number of covered rows.



### 3. Why It‚Äôs ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù & ‚ÄúHard‚Äù

- **Good**:  
  * Constraints are tiny (`n ‚â§ 12`).  
  * A complete search over `2‚Åø` subsets is trivial for modern CPUs.  
  * The solution is short, clear, and language‚Äëagnostic.

- **Bad**:  
  * If you ignore the constraints and think of `n` as large, the na√Øve solution becomes `O(2‚Åø)`, which is impractical.  
  * Forgetting that rows with no `1` are automatically covered can lead to off‚Äëby‚Äëone bugs.

- **Ugly**:  
  * Writing a nested‚Äëloop over columns *inside* a nested‚Äëloop over rows for **every** subset without bit tricks is still correct but slower.  
  * Using heavy data‚Äëstructures (like `Set` for every column) when a simple integer mask works.



### 4. Core Idea ‚Äì Bit‚ÄëMask Enumeration

1. **Represent** the selected columns as a bit mask of length `n`.  
   *Bit i = 1* ‚áî column `i` is chosen.
2. **Generate** all masks with exactly `numSelect` bits set (`C(n, numSelect)` masks).  
   With `n ‚â§ 12`, there are at most 4096 masks.
3. **Count** covered rows for a mask:  
   For each row, iterate columns; if a `1` appears in a column that is *not* set in the mask ‚Üí row is *not* covered.

The time complexity is `O( 2‚Åø ¬∑ m ¬∑ n )`, which is ‚âà 6‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚Åµ operations in the worst case ‚Äì comfortably within limits.



### 5. Three Sample Implementations

- **Java** ‚Äì recursive backtracking with pruning (pick / not‚Äëpick).  
- **Python** ‚Äì straightforward bit‚Äëmask loop (fast, concise).  
- **C++** ‚Äì same logic with `int` masks and `1 << n` iterations.



### 6. Why This Will Impress Interviewers

- **Clarity**: Show that you can reason about subsets in a compact way.  
- **Efficiency**: Point out that the constraints make a brute‚Äëforce approach acceptable.  
- **Versatility**: You can quickly switch to another language; the same algorithm applies.



### 7. Wrap‚ÄëUp & Practice Tips

- **Run** the solution on the LeetCode online judge.  
- **Explain** each line: why we use `~mask`, why we prune, and how the popcount condition works.  
- **Time yourself** on a small test set to demonstrate performance.

Add this problem to your *‚ÄúMust‚ÄëKnow LeetCode‚Äù* list, and you‚Äôll have a solid example of a combinatorial‚Äëbitmask problem that shows you can solve it efficiently and elegantly.
