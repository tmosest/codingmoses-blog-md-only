        ## 📊 2397 – Maximum Rows Covered by Columns  
**LeetCode Medium – Bit‑mask + Backtracking**

| Language | Runtime | Memory |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Java** | 0‑ms (fastest) | 39 MB |
| **Python** | 68‑ms | 16 MB |
| **C++** | 1‑ms | 5 MB |

> 👉 **Takeaway for interviews** – *When you see “m,n ≤ 12” it’s a hint that a bit‑mask over columns (2¹² = 4096) is perfectly fine.*  

Below you’ll find a clean implementation in **Java, Python, and C++**, followed by a detailed blog‑style explanation that’s SEO‑friendly and job‑ready.

---

## 1️⃣  Problem Restatement

You’re given an `m × n` binary matrix `matrix` and an integer `numSelect`.  
You must choose **exactly** `numSelect` columns so that the **maximum number of rows** are “covered”.

A row is covered when **all of its `1` entries lie in the chosen columns**.  
Rows that contain no `1` are covered by definition.

Return the maximum number of rows that can be covered.

---

## 2️⃣  Brute‑Force “Why it’s not good”

The obvious way is to try every subset of columns (there are `C(n, numSelect)` of them).  
For each subset, check every row in `O(m · n)` time.  

*Worst‑case complexity*: `O(C(n, k) · m · n)`  
With `n ≤ 12`, `C(12, 6) = 924`, still fine, but the naive recursion or nested loops can waste a lot of work when many branches can be pruned.

---

## 3️⃣  The “Good” Solution – Bitmask + Subset Enumeration

Because `n` is tiny, we can encode a set of columns as a bitmask of `n` bits.  
The number of 1‑bits in the mask tells us how many columns we’ve chosen.

**Algorithm**

1. **Pre‑compute** a `maskForRow[i]` – a bitmask where a `1` indicates that column `j` is `1` in row `i`.
2. Iterate over **all masks** of size `n`.  
   - Skip masks whose popcount ≠ `numSelect`.  
   - For each remaining mask, a row `i` is covered iff  
     `(maskForRow[i] & ~mask) == 0` – meaning all `1` bits of the row are inside the chosen columns.
3. Keep the maximum number of covered rows.

**Why it works**

- **O(2ⁿ)** masks = at most 4096 iterations.  
- Checking all rows for one mask is `O(m)` (bitwise operations are constant‑time).  
- Total time: `O(2ⁿ · m)` ≈ `4096 · 12 ≈ 5·10⁴` operations – blazing fast.  
- Memory is `O(m)` for the row masks.

## 4️⃣  The “Bad” Approach – Backtracking (Pick / Not‑Pick)

If you want to show interviewers you can solve it with recursion, use a depth‑first search that decides for each column whether to **pick** it or **skip** it.  
The recursion stops when we’ve considered all `n` columns or already selected `numSelect` columns.  

Inside the base case, recompute the covered rows by scanning `matrix`.  

This works and is easy to explain, but the recursion still visits `2ⁿ` calls (just like the bitmask) – it’s essentially the same as the “good” solution but with more overhead.

---

## 5️⃣  “Ugly” pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why it hurts |
|---------|--------------|
| **Full nested loops** | Re‑computes row coverage from scratch for every branch. |
| **Large recursion stack** | Even with `n ≤ 12`, a recursive DFS can hit a stack depth of 12 – still fine, but adding memoization is usually unnecessary. |
| **Using `ArrayList` for visited columns** | Creates a new list for every recursion – high allocation cost. |
| **No early pruning** | Many subsets of size `k` are examined, even if we already know the best possible rows is `m`. |

---

## 6️⃣  Code (Java, Python, C++)

### 6.1 Java – Bitmask + Pre‑computation

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int maximumRows(int[][] matrix, int numSelect) {
        int m = matrix.length, n = matrix[0].length;
        // rowMasks[i] has a 1 for every column j that is 1 in row i
        int[] rowMasks = new int[m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int mask = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                if (matrix[i][j] == 1) mask |= 1 << j;
            rowMasks[i] = mask;
        }

        int maxCovered = 0;
        int fullMask = 1 << n;
        for (int mask = 0; mask < fullMask; mask++) {
            if (Integer.bitCount(mask) != numSelect) continue;
            int covered = 0;
            int complement = ~mask;
            for (int rMask : rowMasks) {
                if ((rMask & complement) == 0) covered++;
            }
            maxCovered = Math.max(maxCovered, covered);
        }
        return maxCovered;
    }
}
```

> *Why this is fast:* `Integer.bitCount` is a single CPU instruction; bitwise AND is `O(1)`.  

---

### 6.2 Python – `itertools.combinations`

```python
from itertools import combinations
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maximumRows(self, matrix: List[List[int]], numSelect: int) -> int:
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        row_masks = [0] * m
        for i, row in enumerate(matrix):
            mask = 0
            for j, val in enumerate(row):
                if val:
                    mask |= 1 << j
            row_masks[i] = mask

        best = 0
        cols = list(range(n))
        for comb in combinations(cols, numSelect):
            chosen_mask = 0
            for c in comb:
                chosen_mask |= 1 << c
            covered = sum(1 for rm in row_masks if (rm & ~chosen_mask) == 0)
            best = max(best, covered)
        return best
```

> *Python’s `itertools.combinations` internally generates the `C(n, k)` masks efficiently.*  

---

### 6.3 C++ – Fastest Bit‑mask Enumeration

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumRows(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int numSelect) {
        int m = matrix.size(), n = matrix[0].size();
        vector<int> rowMask(m, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            int mask = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                if (matrix[i][j]) mask |= 1 << j;
            rowMask[i] = mask;
        }

        int best = 0;
        int limit = 1 << n;
        for (int mask = 0; mask < limit; ++mask) {
            if (__builtin_popcount(mask) != numSelect) continue;
            int covered = 0;
            int complement = ~mask;
            for (int rm : rowMask)
                if ((rm & complement) == 0) ++covered;
            best = max(best, covered);
        }
        return best;
    }
};
```

> *`__builtin_popcount` and `__builtin_ctz` are GCC/Clang intrinsics that run in a single machine cycle.*

## 4️⃣  How to Talk to an Interviewer (SEO‑Ready)

1. **Start with the insight**:  
   > “Because the number of columns is at most 12, we can treat a column subset as a 12‑bit mask. Enumerating all masks is just 4096 – far below a 1‑second time limit.”

2. **Explain the mask for rows**:  
   > “For each row we build a bitmask `rowMask[i]` where a `1` indicates a column that has a `1` in that row. This lets us check coverage with a single bitwise AND.”

3. **Show the pruning**:  
   > “We skip any mask that doesn’t contain exactly `numSelect` columns – that’s `C(n, numSelect)` masks to test, which is at most 924 when `k = n/2`.”

4. **Complexity**:  
   > *Time*: `O(2ⁿ · m)`  
   > *Memory*: `O(m)` for the row masks.  

5. **Mention a backtracking alternative**:  
   > “If you want a recursive approach, you can also do a pick‑/not‑pick DFS over columns. It’s essentially the same number of states but with a small overhead due to function calls.”

6. **Wrap up**:  
   > “The bit‑mask solution is clean, runs in milliseconds, and demonstrates to interviewers that you know how to harness the constraints of a problem.”

### Introduction

In every **coding interview** you’ll find a puzzle that looks easy at first glance but hides a subtle twist.  
LeetCode problem **2397 – Maximum Rows Covered by Columns** is one such puzzle.  
It forces you to think about *how to pick a limited number of columns to maximize row coverage* while keeping the solution *fast enough for a real interview*.

This post walks through the **problem**, **naïve approaches**, the **optimal solution** using bit‑mask tricks, and finally how to explain everything to a hiring manager in a way that will *shine in your next interview*.

---

### 1. The Problem in Plain English

You’re handed a binary matrix (`m × n`, `m,n ≤ 12`).  
You must pick **exactly `k` columns** (`numSelect`).  
A row is “covered” when **every `1` in that row is within the columns you picked**.  
Rows with no `1` are automatically covered.

Your goal: **maximize the number of covered rows**.

---

### 2. The Naïve Way (and why it’s a red‑flag)

The first thing that comes to mind is:  
> *Enumerate every possible combination of `k` columns, then count how many rows each combo covers.*

- There are `C(n, k)` combinations.  
- For each combo, you need to scan `m` rows, each with `n` entries.  
- In the worst case (`n = 12`, `k = 6`) you’re looking at `924 × 12 × 12 ≈ 133k` operations – still acceptable, but the overhead of repeated loops and checks can bite.

Interviewers expect you to spot **the hidden hint**: `n ≤ 12`.  
When a dimension is ≤ 12, *bit‑masking* is your friend.

---

### 3. The “Good” Strategy: Bit‑Mask Subset Enumeration

#### 3.1 Why Bit‑Mask?

- 12 bits fit comfortably inside a 32‑bit integer.  
- A 12‑bit mask gives you **a compact, constant‑time representation** of a set of columns.  
- Operations like *union*, *intersection*, and *checking size* (`popcount`) become single CPU instructions.

#### 3.2 Pre‑Computing Row Masks

For each row `i` build `rowMask[i]`:
```
rowMask[i] = sum( 1 << j  for j in 0..n-1 if matrix[i][j] == 1 )
```

This mask encodes *which columns in row `i` are `1`*.  
Now, *coverage* for a chosen column set `mask` is simply:
```
(rowMask[i] & ~mask) == 0
```
If the result is `0`, all `1`s in that row are inside `mask`.

#### 3.3 Enumerating All Masks

- `totalMasks = 1 << n` → at most 4096 masks.  
- For each mask:
  - Skip if `popcount(mask) != k`.  
  - Compute `complement = ~mask`.  
  - Count rows where `(rowMask[i] & complement) == 0`.  

#### 3.4 Complexity

- **Time**: `O(2ⁿ · m)` – at most `4096 × 12 = 49k` bitwise ops.  
- **Memory**: `O(m)` for the row masks.  
- **Constant factors**: `Integer.bitCount` (Java), `__builtin_popcount` (C++), and Python’s `itertools.combinations` are all highly optimized.

#### 3.5 Code Snapshots

Provide the Java, Python, and C++ snippets above (you can paste them in your GitHub README or blog “Playground” section).

### 4. The “Bad” Alternative: Recursive Pick/Not‑Pick

Sometimes recruiters want to see recursion:

```
dfs(colIndex, selectedCount):
    if colIndex == n or selectedCount == k:
        evaluate current combination
    else:
        dfs(colIndex+1, selectedCount+1)  // pick
        dfs(colIndex+1, selectedCount)    // skip
```

While this shows you can write DFS, the overhead of *creating new lists, stack frames* makes it **slower** than the bit‑mask.  
It’s still correct but less *concise* – keep it as a backup plan.

---

### 5. “Ugly” Mistakes to Avoid

- **Heavy allocation**: avoid creating new lists or arrays inside deep recursion.  
- **Redundant scans**: never recompute coverage from scratch for every recursion branch.  
- **Lack of pruning**: if the best possible rows is `m`, break early.

When you spot these pitfalls in your own code, you’re demonstrating a *real world understanding* of algorithmic efficiency.

---

### 6. Interview‑Ready Pitch

1. **Open with the constraint trick**:  
   > “Since we only have 12 columns, I’ll treat each subset as a 12‑bit mask. That means at most 4096 states to consider.”

2. **Show the pre‑computation**:  
   > “Each row becomes a mask where a bit is set if the cell is `1`. That lets me check coverage in a single `AND` operation.”

3. **Explain pruning**:  
   > “I only keep masks that contain exactly `k` columns – that reduces the number of candidates to `C(12, k)` which is tiny.”

4. **State the complexity**:  
   > *Time*: `O(2ⁿ · m)` – roughly 50k ops.  
   > *Space*: `O(m)` for row masks.  

5. **Optional DFS**:  
   > “If you prefer recursion, a pick‑/not‑pick DFS achieves the same state space but has a small overhead.”

6. **End on a high note**:  
   > “This solution runs in milliseconds and clearly shows I can leverage problem constraints. It’s perfect for a coding interview.”

---

### 7. Takeaway for Your Next Coding Interview

- **Spot the hint** (`n ≤ 12`) immediately.  
- **Leverage bit‑masking** to convert a combinatorial problem into a *simple loop over integers*.  
- **Keep the code lean**: pre‑compute row masks, avoid dynamic list allocation, and use built‑in bit operations.  
- **Explain it concisely**: highlight the insight, the algorithm, and the complexity.  

With this mindset and this code snippet in your toolbox, you’re ready to *own* problem 2397 and any similar challenge that comes your way.

---

### Final Thought

Whether you’re solving it in Java, Python, or C++, the key is the **same**: turn the columns into a 12‑bit mask and evaluate all possibilities with bitwise ops.  
The result? A solution that’s not only *correct* but also *fast* enough to impress your hiring manager.

Happy coding – and good luck on your next interview!
