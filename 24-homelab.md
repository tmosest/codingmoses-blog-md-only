# Hot Wheels RC Spy Race Car POV ESP 32 Sense

"Granny shifting when you should have been double clutching..." - Fast and Furious...

Made a new github repo and picked up where I left off here. 
Fried this little power adapter I had for taking 12 V down to 5 V and 3.3 V no worries used a buck converter and made a new one basically.
That was not as fun nor as delicious as frying a raspberry pi though.... lol...

Now we have a light and the ESP 32 Controller being powered from two breadboards attached to each other. One is just a simple power rig and the other are the component for this RC car.

Just need to get some software working... and like that we have wifi manager working...
