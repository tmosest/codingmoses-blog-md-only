### üîç Problem Recap

Given a lowercase string `s` (1‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ|s|‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ10‚Åµ), return the length of the longest contiguous substring where every adjacent pair of characters differ by exactly **1** in their ASCII value (i.e., they are consecutive letters of the alphabet).

> The core idea is a single linear scan keeping a running length of the current consecutive block.  
> When the next character is *not* the successor of the current one, the block ends and we reset the counter.

## üìÑ Blog Article ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of LeetCode‚ÄØ2414‚Äù

### üöÄ Introduction

If you‚Äôre prepping for coding interviews, you‚Äôve probably seen the **Longest Alphabetical Continuous Substring** problem on LeetCode (#2414). At first glance it looks deceptively simple, but it offers a great teaching moment for both **algorithmic thinking** and **clean code**. In this article, we‚Äôll dissect the problem, explore the strengths and pitfalls of various solution strategies, and give you SEO‚Äëfriendly insights that can help you land your dream tech job.

> **Keywords**: *Longest Alphabetical Continuous Substring*, *LeetCode 2414*, *coding interview*, *Java Python C++*, *two‚Äëpointer technique*, *string manipulation*, *O(n) solution*.

---

### üìå Problem Recap (The ‚ÄúGood‚Äù)

- **Definition**: A substring where each adjacent pair of characters are consecutive letters of the alphabet (e.g., `"abc"` or `"xyz"`).
- **Goal**: Return the *maximum* length of such a substring.
- **Constraints**: `1‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ|s|‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ10‚Åµ`, all lowercase letters.

The constraints immediately tell us we need an **O(n)** solution; any algorithm that scans the string more than once (e.g., nested loops) would time out on the upper limit.

---

### üîß ‚ÄúThe Bad‚Äù ‚Äì Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why it fails | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Nested loops / DP** | O(n¬≤) time | A double loop that checks every substring. Works for tiny inputs but TLE for 10‚Åµ. |
| **Assuming ‚Äúa‚Äù follows ‚Äúz‚Äù** | Misinterpreting continuity | `za` is *not* valid, but some na√Øve implementations may treat it as consecutive. |
| **Missing edge cases** | Empty string / single character | Although constraints forbid it, defensive programming helps avoid runtime errors in interview settings. |
| **Using extra memory for suffixes** | O(n) space but unnecessary | Storing all substrings or a map of prefixes uses memory that‚Äôs not needed. |
| **Misusing `StringBuilder` in Java** | Wrong index calculations | Off‚Äëby‚Äëone errors in `charAt` lead to incorrect results. |

Being aware of these mistakes is the first step toward writing clean, interview‚Äëready code.

---

### üõ† ‚ÄúThe Ugly‚Äù ‚Äì Over‚Äëengineering the Solution

Some candidates try to over‚Äëcomplicate the problem:

1. **Regular expressions**  
   *Ugly* because the regex for consecutive letters is non‚Äëtrivial (`(?=a)b(?=c)`‚Ä¶).
2. **Custom data structures**  
   Building a trie or suffix tree is overkill.  
3. **Recursion**  
   Recursively scanning substrings increases stack depth unnecessarily.  

These approaches not only make the solution harder to read but also risk exceeding time or memory limits.

---

### ‚ú® The Cleanest Approach ‚Äì One‚ÄëPass Two‚ÄëPointer Scan

**Why it‚Äôs great**:

- **Time**: `O(n)` ‚Äì single linear pass.  
- **Space**: `O(1)` ‚Äì only two integer counters.  
- **Readability**: The logic is straightforward and easy to explain during an interview.  
- **Extensibility**: The same pattern works for related problems (e.g., longest increasing substring, longest palindrome).

#### Pseudocode

```
maxLen = 1
curLen = 1
for i from 0 to len(s)-2:
    if s[i+1] - s[i] == 1:
        curLen += 1
        maxLen = max(maxLen, curLen)
    else:
        curLen = 1
return maxLen
```

The key insight: **if two adjacent letters are consecutive, extend the current block; otherwise reset to 1**.

### üìä Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Single scan | **O(n)** | **O(1)** |
| Edge‚Äëcase checks | Negligible | Negligible |

---

### üß© Variations & Extensions

| Variation | How to Adapt | Why it matters |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Case‚Äëinsensitive** | Convert to lowercase once. | Common interview trick. |
| **Wrap‚Äëaround** (`"xyzabc"` valid) | Add a check for `s[i] == 'z' && s[i+1] == 'a'`. | Shows ability to handle edge conditions. |
| **Longest continuous subsequence (not necessarily contiguous)** | Use DP or two pointers with a set. | Tests understanding of subsequence vs substring. |

Explaining these variations can demonstrate depth of knowledge and flexibility.

### üéØ Interview Tips

1. **Clarify ‚Äúcontinuous‚Äù**: Ask the interviewer whether `'z'` followed by `'a'` counts.  
2. **Explain complexity upfront**: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll scan the string once, so it‚Äôs O(n).‚Äù  
3. **Discuss edge cases**: ‚ÄúWhat if the string is one character? What about empty input?‚Äù  
4. **Mention time/space trade‚Äëoffs**: ‚ÄúThis solution uses constant space; if we needed to return all such substrings, we‚Äôd need more space.‚Äù  
5. **Show confidence in coding style**: Use meaningful variable names (`currentLen`, `maxLen`) and add comments.

### üöÄ SEO‚ÄëFriendly Conclusion

The *Longest Alphabetical Continuous Substring* problem (LeetCode 2414) is a classic interview question that tests string manipulation, linear‚Äëtime algorithms, and careful handling of edge cases. By mastering the one‚Äëpass two‚Äëpointer solution in Java, Python, or C++, you‚Äôll demonstrate:

- **Algorithmic efficiency** (O(n) time, O(1) space)  
- **Clean coding practices** (clear variables, defensive checks)  
- **Versatility** (easy adaptation to variations)

Whether you‚Äôre tackling this problem for a coding challenge or preparing for a technical interview, the key is to keep the solution simple, readable, and robust. Good luck ‚Äì and happy coding!
