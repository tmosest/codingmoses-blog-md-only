        ## 1️⃣  Solution Overview  

**Problem 2424 – Longest Uploaded Prefix**  
You are given a stream of `n` distinct videos numbered from `1` to `n`.  
* `upload(video)` – marks that a video has been uploaded.  
* `longest()` – returns the largest `i` such that every video `1 … i` has already been uploaded.  

The goal is to design a data structure that supports both operations in **amortized O(1)** time and **O(n)** memory.

> **Key insight** – Keep a running variable `max` that stores the current longest prefix length.  
> Whenever a new video is uploaded, if it equals `max+1` we can safely extend the prefix; otherwise we just remember that the video exists.  
> After each upload, repeatedly increase `max` while the next number is present.

This approach uses a hash‑set (or boolean array) to remember uploaded videos that are *behind* the current prefix.

### Java  
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

/**
 * Leetcode 2424 – Longest Uploaded Prefix
 */
public class LUPrefix {

    // Set of videos that have been uploaded but are not yet part of the prefix.
    private final Set<Integer> seen;
    // Current longest prefix length.
    private int max;

    public LUPrefix(int n) {
        // We only need to store uploaded videos, size ≤ n
        this.seen = new HashSet<>(n);
        this.max = 0;
    }

    /** Uploads a new video */
    public void upload(int video) {
        seen.add(video);
        // Advance max while the next required video is already uploaded
        while (seen.contains(max + 1)) {
            max++;
        }
    }

    /** Returns the current longest uploaded prefix length */
    public int longest() {
        return max;
    }
}
```

### Python  
```python
class LUPrefix:
    """
    Leetcode 2424 – Longest Uploaded Prefix
    Python 3 implementation
    """

    def __init__(self, n: int):
        # Store uploaded videos that are not yet part of the prefix
        self.seen = set()
        self.max = 0

    def upload(self, video: int) -> None:
        self.seen.add(video)
        # Grow max while the next needed video is present
        while self.max + 1 in self.seen:
            self.max += 1

    def longest(self) -> int:
        return self.max
```

### C++  
```cpp
#include <unordered_set>

/**
 * Leetcode 2424 – Longest Uploaded Prefix
 * C++17 implementation
 */
class LUPrefix {
private:
    std::unordered_set<int> seen;  // Uploaded videos not yet in prefix
    int maxPrefix;                 // Current longest prefix

public:
    explicit LUPrefix(int n) : maxPrefix(0) {
        // Reserve space to avoid rehashing
        seen.reserve(n * 2);
    }

    void upload(int video) {
        seen.insert(video);
        while (seen.find(maxPrefix + 1) != seen.end()) {
            ++maxPrefix;
        }
    }

    int longest() const {
        return maxPrefix;
    }
};
```

### 3.1  Why This Problem Rocks

* **Real‑world relevance** – Think of a streaming service that uploads videos sequentially; the longest prefix tells you how many videos are ready for broadcast.  
* **Interview favorite** – It’s a clean, single‑data‑structure problem that tests your ability to think about state and amortized analysis.  
* **Cross‑language practice** – You can solve it in Java, Python, C++, and many more; the pattern stays the same.

### 3.2  The Good – A One‑Line Insight

```text
max += 1  while  max+1 is already uploaded
```

The only trick is to keep a `max` variable that *always* represents the longest contiguous prefix.  
When a video arrives, you simply add it to a set (or a boolean array).  
If that video is the next one in the sequence, you bump `max` and check again.

*Time* – O(1) amortized per call.  
*Space* – O(n) worst‑case, but often less because once a video becomes part of the prefix it can be discarded.

---

### 3.3  The Bad – Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why it’s wrong | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Using a linear scan each time** – `while (max+1 <= n && uploaded[max+1])` | Scans up to `n` on each call, O(n²) worst‑case. | Use a hash‑set or boolean array and only iterate while the next video is present. |
| **Forgetting to update `max` after upload** – `upload()` adds to set but never moves the pointer. | `longest()` always returns 0. | After `upload`, run the while‑loop that increments `max`. |
| **Storing too many states** – e.g., keeping a full adjacency list. | Unnecessary memory, slower operations. | Only store the uploaded numbers; the prefix is implicit in `max`. |
| **Off‑by‑one errors** – using `max` instead of `max+1` in the loop condition. | Causes infinite loops or missed updates. | Carefully test with `while (set.contains(max + 1))`. |

### 3.4  The Ugly – More Complex Solutions You Should Avoid

1. **Union‑Find** – Some solve this with a disjoint‑set union (DSU) where each component represents a contiguous block. While it works, it introduces extra bookkeeping and a heavier constant factor.  
2. **Segment Trees** – Building a segment tree to query whether all videos in `[1, i]` are uploaded is overkill and has O(log n) per call.  
3. **Recursive/Backtracking** – Attempting to reconstruct the prefix on every query is both slow and hard to reason about.

> *Bottom line*: The hash‑set + `max` pointer is the “golden solution” – clean, fast, and interview‑friendly.

---

### 3.5  Interview Tips

1. **Explain the idea first** – Talk about the `max` pointer and why it’s enough.  
2. **Discuss complexity** – Emphasize *amortized* O(1) and why the while‑loop is bounded by `n`.  
3. **Mention edge cases** – No videos uploaded, last video uploaded first, random order.  
4. **Show code in your chosen language** – Keep it concise, use meaningful names (`maxPrefix`, `seen`, etc.).  
5. **Talk about alternatives** – Briefly describe DSU or segment tree, then explain why the simpler solution wins.

---

### 3.6  Final Thoughts – Land the Job

* Leetcode 2424 is a **micro‑problem** that demonstrates your mastery of data structures and time‑space trade‑offs.  
* By mastering this, you’re showing interviewers that you can pick the *right* algorithm rather than defaulting to brute force.  
* Practice variations: what if uploads aren’t distinct? What if `longest()` is called after every upload?  
* Pair this with other “prefix / suffix” problems (e.g., “Longest Subarray With Sum Equals K”) to showcase a pattern.

> **Takeaway**: Keep your solution elegant, comment it, and be ready to explain the intuition. That’s what recruiters look for—and that’s what lands you that software engineering role.  

Happy coding, and good luck on your interview! 🚀
