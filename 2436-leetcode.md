## 1. Problem Overview  

> **LeetCode 2436 – Minimum Split Into Subarrays With GCD Greater Than One**  
> **Difficulty:** Medium  
> **Input:** `int[] nums` (length ≤ 2000, each element ≥ 2)  
> **Goal:** Split `nums` into the fewest contiguous subarrays such that **every subarray’s GCD > 1**.  
> **Return:** Minimum number of subarrays.  

> **Example**  
> ```text
> Input:  nums = [12, 6, 3, 14, 8]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: [12,6,3] (GCD = 3) and [14,8] (GCD = 2)
> ```

## 2. Key Insights & Greedy Strategy  

1. **GCD is Monotonic** – Adding a new element can only keep or decrease the GCD.  
2. **Whenever GCD becomes 1, the current subarray is impossible** – we must start a new subarray.  
3. **Greedy is optimal** – Starting a new subarray immediately when the GCD hits 1 yields the minimal number of splits.  
   *Proof Sketch:* Any solution that delays splitting would keep the GCD = 1 for later elements, violating the condition. Hence the earliest split is mandatory.

Thus we just need to walk through the array once, maintaining the running GCD.

## 3. Optimal Solution (O(N log M))

Below are concise, production‑ready implementations in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.

> **Note**  
> *`M` is the maximum value in `nums` (≤ 10⁹).*  
> The Euclidean algorithm runs in `O(log M)` for each pair.

### Java (O(N log M))

```java
// LeetCode 2436 – Minimum Split Into Subarrays With GCD > 1
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minimumSplits(int[] nums) {
        int splits = 1;                 // at least one subarray
        int currGCD = nums[0];          // GCD of current subarray

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            currGCD = gcd(currGCD, nums[i]);

            if (currGCD == 1) {        // cannot extend current subarray
                splits++;
                currGCD = nums[i];     // start new subarray
            }
        }
        return splits;
    }

    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int t = a % b;
            a = b;
            b = t;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```

### Python 3 (O(N log M))

```python
# LeetCode 2436 – Minimum Split Into Subarrays With GCD > 1
from math import gcd
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumSplits(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        splits = 1          # start with one subarray
        curr_gcd = nums[0]  # GCD of current subarray

        for num in nums[1:]:
            curr_gcd = gcd(curr_gcd, num)
            if curr_gcd == 1:
                splits += 1
                curr_gcd = num

        return splits
```

---

### C++ (O(N log M))

```cpp
// LeetCode 2436 – Minimum Split Into Subarrays With GCD > 1
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>   // std::gcd

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSplits(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int splits = 1;            // at least one subarray
        int currGCD = nums[0];     // GCD of current subarray

        for (size_t i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            currGCD = std::gcd(currGCD, nums[i]);
            if (currGCD == 1) {    // must start new subarray
                ++splits;
                currGCD = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return splits;
    }
};
```

## 4. Time & Space Complexity  

| Language | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| Java     | **O(N log M)** | **O(1)** |
| Python   | **O(N log M)** | **O(1)** |
| C++      | **O(N log M)** | **O(1)** |

*The `O(log M)` factor comes from the Euclidean GCD calculation for each adjacent pair.*

## 5. Common Pitfalls & “Ugly” Edge Cases  

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Starting a new subarray only when `currGCD` becomes 0** | GCD never becomes 0; we must split when it hits 1. | Check for `currGCD == 1`. |
| **Using `Math.max` or `Math.min` instead of GCD** | Incorrectly assumes largest or smallest element matters. | Always compute GCD of the entire current subarray. |
| **Not resetting `currGCD` after a split** | Next subarray starts with wrong GCD (previous value). | Set `currGCD = nums[i]` after incrementing `splits`. |
| **Assuming array size 1 returns 1** | Works, but code must still handle edge case. | Code naturally returns 1 for single‑element arrays. |
| **Using floating‑point GCD** | Precision loss. | Use integer GCD (Euclid). |
| **Exceeding recursion depth in Python's recursive gcd** | For very large numbers recursion depth may hit limit. | Use iterative gcd or `math.gcd`. |

## 6. Alternative Approaches  

| Approach | When It Might Be Useful | Complexity |
|----------|------------------------|------------|
| **Dynamic Programming (DP)** | For problems where subarray boundaries are not greedy‑determined (e.g., weighted splits). | `O(N² log M)` – too slow for N = 2000. |
| **Sliding Window with GCD** | If you need to answer queries about subarray GCDs after splits. | `O(N log M)` per query, but not needed here. |
| **Prime Factorization & DP** | If you only care about primes, you can pre‑compute smallest prime factors and track shared primes. | More memory and preprocessing, unnecessary overhead. |

> **Bottom line:** The greedy single‑pass solution is optimal and far simpler than DP or prime‑factor tricks for this specific LeetCode problem.

## 7. Why This Problem Matters for Interviews  

1. **Array + GCD** – Combines classic data structures (arrays) with number theory (GCD).  
2. **Greedy Validation** – Tests your ability to reason about optimality with monotonic properties.  
3. **Edge‑Case Awareness** – Small input sizes, large numbers, and strict conditions push you to think about integer limits.  
4. **Clean Code** – LeetCode prizes concise, readable solutions; the `O(N)` greedy approach exemplifies that.  

> *Interview Tip:*  
> “I started with a straightforward greedy algorithm that iterates once through the array, updating the running GCD. Because the GCD can only stay the same or shrink, I split whenever it hits 1. This guarantees the fewest splits and runs in O(N log M).”

<a name="conclusion"></a>
## 8. Wrap‑Up & Career Take‑away  

* **Problem‑Solving Skill** – Shows your capacity to distill a problem to a monotonic invariant.  
* **Algorithmic Breadth** – Familiarity with GCD, greedy strategies, and complexity analysis.  
* **Code Quality** – Produces short, bug‑free implementations across languages.  

If you can articulate this solution in an interview, you demonstrate a solid foundation in algorithm design and a knack for clean, efficient code—exactly what hiring managers look for in a candidate.
