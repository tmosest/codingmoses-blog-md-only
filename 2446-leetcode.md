        # 2446 – Determine If Two Events Have Conflict  
**A Quick‑Win for Your LeetCode Portfolio (Java | Python | C++)**

---

## Why This Problem Matters  
- **Interview‑relevance**: Interval overlap appears in every software‑engineering interview – from scheduling APIs to calendar apps.  
- **LeetCode‑rating**: *Easy* (2446) – perfect for polishing your problem‑solving speed.  
- **Real‑world impact**: Calendar integrations, booking systems, and conflict detection in distributed systems all rely on the same logic.  

By mastering this problem, you’ll demonstrate:  
1. **Time‑efficient thinking** (O(1) solution).  
2. **Language versatility** (Java, Python, C++).  
3. **Clean code discipline** (one‑liner, commented).  

Let’s dive in!

---

## Problem Recap  
> You’re given two *inclusive* time intervals on the same day:  
> ```event1 = [startTime1, endTime1]```  
> ```event2 = [startTime2, endTime2]```  
> Each time is in `HH:MM` format (24‑hour clock).  
> Return `true` if the two events share any common moment; otherwise `false`.

---

## The Insight – One Line, One Rule  
Two inclusive intervals overlap **iff**  

```
start1 ≤ end2  AND  start2 ≤ end1
```

This can be written directly with string comparison because `HH:MM` strings compare lexicographically the same as their numeric values.

---

## 1. Java – A One‑Liner with `String.compareTo`  
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean haveConflict(String[] event1, String[] event2) {
        // event1[0] <= event2[1]  AND  event2[0] <= event1[1]
        return event1[0].compareTo(event2[1]) <= 0
             && event2[0].compareTo(event1[1]) <= 0;
    }
}
```

*Why this works*:  
- `String.compareTo` returns a negative, zero, or positive integer depending on lexicographic order.  
- `<= 0` means “≤” in string terms.

---

## 2. Python – Simple, Readable, and Idiomatic  
```python
class Solution:
    def haveConflict(self, event1: list[str], event2: list[str]) -> bool:
        return event1[0] <= event2[1] and event2[0] <= event1[1]
```

Python’s `<` and `<=` operators for strings follow the same lexical rules, so the same O(1) logic applies.

---

## 3. C++ – Using `std::string` Comparison  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool haveConflict(vector<string>& event1, vector<string>& event2) {
        return event1[0] <= event2[1] && event2[0] <= event1[1];
    }
};
```

`std::string` overloads comparison operators to perform lexicographic ordering, making the one‑liner identical to the Java and Python solutions.

---

## Complexity Analysis  
| Language | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| Java, Python, C++ | **O(1)** | **O(1)** |

Only a few constant‑time comparisons are performed; no extra memory allocation is needed beyond the input arrays.

---

## The Good, The Bad, The Ugly

### The Good  
- **Simplicity**: One line of code, no loops, no conversions.  
- **Performance**: Constant time and memory.  
- **Portability**: Same logic works across Java, Python, and C++.  

### The Bad  
- **String‑Based**: Relying on lexical comparison feels a bit “magical” to beginners; they might not immediately realize why `HH:MM` strings compare the same as minutes.  
- **Readability for New Developers**: Some interviewers prefer explicit parsing to minutes (e.g., converting to total minutes) for clarity.

### The Ugly  
- **Edge‑Case Perception**: If one mis‑reads “inclusive” vs “exclusive” endpoints, they might implement a wrong comparison (e.g., using `<` instead of `<=`).  
- **Locale/Locale‑Dependent Issues**: In rare cases, string comparison might be affected by locale settings (though `String.compareTo` is locale‑independent).  

---

## Bonus: Explicit Parsing (for interviewers who like the “show your work” approach)

```java
public boolean haveConflict(String[] e1, String[] e2) {
    int s1 = toMinutes(e1[0]), e1End = toMinutes(e1[1]);
    int s2 = toMinutes(e2[0]), e2End = toMinutes(e2[1]);

    return s1 <= e2End && s2 <= e1End;
}

private int toMinutes(String time) {
    String[] parts = time.split(":");
    return Integer.parseInt(parts[0]) * 60 + Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
}
```

This version is a bit longer but shows clear conversion to numeric minutes, eliminating any doubt about string ordering.
