## 1. Problem Statement (LeetCode 2448)

You’re given two integer arrays of equal length `nums` and `cost`.  
You may increment or decrement any element of `nums` by 1, and each such unit operation on index `i` costs `cost[i]`.  

> **Task** – Find the minimum total cost to make **all** elements of `nums` equal.

### Constraints

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| `1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵` | (n = length of the arrays) |
| `1 ≤ nums[i], cost[i] ≤ 10⁶` | |
| Result fits in a signed 64‑bit integer (`long`) |

## 2. The “Good” – Convexity + Weighted Median

### 2.1 Why is the Cost Function Convex?

For a fixed target value `x`, the cost to bring every element to `x` is  

```
f(x) = Σ |nums[i] – x| * cost[i]
```

The absolute value is a convex function; a linear combination with positive weights preserves convexity.  
Therefore, **f(x) is convex** over the integers.

A convex function over a discrete interval `[L, R]` attains its minimum at a single point (or an interval of points).  
That means we can apply a *binary search on the answer* (sometimes called *ternary search on a convex integer function*).

### 2.2 Weighted Median Interpretation

If you sort the pairs `(nums[i], cost[i])` by `nums[i]`, the optimal `x` is the *weighted median* of the `nums` values where the weights are `cost[i]`.  
In other words, find the smallest `x` such that the total cost weight on the left side of `x` is at least half of the total weight.

This gives an **O(n log n)** solution: sort once and then a single pass to locate the weighted median.

---

## 3. The “Bad” – Pure Brute Force (O(n · range))

A naïve approach would iterate over every possible target value from `min(nums)` to `max(nums)` and compute `f(x)` each time.  
Given that `nums[i]` can be up to `10⁶`, this is far too slow (worst‑case `10⁶ · 10⁵` operations).  
We’ll skip this for production.

---

## 4. The “Ugly” – Incorrect Binary Search Boundaries

If you mistakenly set the binary‑search bounds to `[0, 10⁶]` instead of `[min(nums), max(nums)]`, you may waste many iterations.  
Also, failing to use a 64‑bit integer (`long` in Java/C++, `int64` in Python) will overflow for large inputs.

---

## 5. Production‑Ready Implementations

Below are three clean, well‑documented solutions:

| Language | Approach | Time | Space |
|----------|----------|------|-------|
| **Java** | Binary Search + Convexity | `O(n log range)` (~ `log(10⁶)` ≈ 20) | `O(1)` |
| **Python** | Binary Search + Convexity | `O(n log range)` | `O(1)` |
| **C++** | Binary Search + Convexity | `O(n log range)` | `O(1)` |

Feel free to copy‑paste the snippet into your IDE or LeetCode editor.

### 5.1 Java (LeetCode‑ready)

```java
/**
 * 2448. Minimum Cost to Make Array Equal (Hard)
 * LeetCode Submission
 */
class Solution {
    // Helper: compute total cost for target x
    private long totalCost(int[] nums, int[] cost, long x) {
        long sum = 0L;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += Math.abs(nums[i] - x) * cost[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }

    public long minCost(int[] nums, int[] cost) {
        // Search space is between min and max of nums
        long left = Long.MAX_VALUE, right = Long.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int n : nums) {
            left = Math.min(left, n);
            right = Math.max(right, n);
        }

        long best = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        while (left <= right) {
            long mid = (left + right) / 2;
            long costMid = totalCost(nums, cost, mid);
            long costMidPlus = totalCost(nums, cost, mid + 1);

            // If cost is decreasing, go left; else go right
            if (costMid <= costMidPlus) {
                best = Math.min(best, costMid);
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                best = Math.min(best, costMidPlus);
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return best;
    }
}
```

*Why it’s safe:*  
* Uses `long` for all intermediate results – no overflow.  
* Binary‑search bounds are tight (between `min(nums)` and `max(nums)`).  
* The loop condition is `left <= right` to guarantee termination.

### 5.2 Python (LeetCode‑ready)

```python
"""
2448. Minimum Cost to Make Array Equal (Hard)
LeetCode Submission – Python 3.8
"""
class Solution:
    @staticmethod
    def _cost(nums, costs, target: int) -> int:
        """Return the total cost to bring all elements to `target`."""
        return sum(abs(n - target) * c for n, c in zip(nums, costs))

    def minCost(self, nums: list[int], costs: list[int]) -> int:
        left, right = min(nums), max(nums)
        best = float('inf')

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            cost_mid = self._cost(nums, costs, mid)
            cost_next = self._cost(nums, costs, mid + 1)

            # f(x) is convex → choose the side with lower cost
            if cost_mid <= cost_next:
                best = min(best, cost_mid)
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                best = min(best, cost_next)
                left = mid + 1

        return int(best)
```

*Python’s `int` is arbitrary precision, so no overflow concerns.*

### 5.3 C++ (LeetCode‑ready)

```cpp
/**
 * 2448. Minimum Cost to Make Array Equal (Hard)
 * LeetCode Submission
 */
class Solution {
    // Helper: compute total cost for target x
    long long costForTarget(const vector<int>& nums,
                            const vector<int>& cost,
                            long long x) {
        long long sum = 0;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            sum += llabs(nums[i] - x) * cost[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }

public:
    long long minCost(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& cost) {
        long long left = LLONG_MAX, right = LLONG_MIN;
        for (int n : nums) {
            left = min(left, (long long)n);
            right = max(right, (long long)n);
        }

        long long best = LLONG_MAX;
        while (left <= right) {
            long long mid = (left + right) / 2;
            long long cur = costForTarget(nums, cost, mid);
            long long nxt = costForTarget(nums, cost, mid + 1);

            if (cur <= nxt) {
                best = min(best, cur);
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                best = min(best, nxt);
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return best;
    }
};
```

*All arithmetic uses `long long` to avoid 32‑bit overflow.*

## 6. Complexity Recap

| Approach | Complexity |
|----------|------------|
| Binary Search (all languages) | **O(n log 10⁶)** ≈ **O(n · 20)** → ~2 million operations for 10⁵ elements. |
| Weighted Median (sort‑then‑scan) | **O(n log n)** (sorting dominates). |
| Space | **O(1)** auxiliary (except for the input arrays). |

Both solutions comfortably meet the hard‑level time limit on LeetCode.
