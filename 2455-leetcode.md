## 📌 Problem Recap

> **Input**: `int[] nums` – array of positive integers.  
> **Task**: Return the *average* (rounded down) of all numbers that are **both even** and **divisible by 3**.  
> **Return**: `0` if no such numbers exist.

| Example | Output |
|---------|--------|
| `[1,3,6,10,12,15]` | `9` |
| `[1,2,4,7,10]` | `0` |

*Constraints*: `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 1000`, `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 1000`.

## 🧠 Solution Strategy

1. **Filter** the array: keep numbers where `num % 6 == 0` (even & divisible by 3).  
2. **Sum** and **count** the filtered numbers.  
3. Compute `sum / count` (integer division automatically floors).  
4. If count is `0`, return `0`.

All steps run in **O(n)** time, **O(1)** extra space.

## 📄 Code Snippets

Below you’ll find clean, production‑ready implementations in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**. Each follows the same logic but uses idiomatic features of the language.

---

### Java (Java 17)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int averageValue(int[] nums) {
        long sum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
            if (n % 6 == 0) {          // even & divisible by 3
                sum += n;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count == 0 ? 0 : (int)(sum / count);
    }

    // Optional: Java 8+ Stream version
    public int averageValueStream(int[] nums) {
        return Arrays.stream(nums)
                     .filter(n -> n % 6 == 0)
                     .mapToLong(n -> n)   // avoid overflow
                     .average()
                     .orElse(0.0)
                     .intValue();
    }
}
```

**Why it’s good**  
- Linear pass, minimal branching.  
- `long` sum prevents overflow on larger input ranges.  
- Stream version shows modern Java style.

---

### Python (Python 3.10+)

```python
class Solution:
    def averageValue(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        filtered = [n for n in nums if n % 6 == 0]
        return sum(filtered) // len(filtered) if filtered else 0
```

**Why it’s good**  
- List comprehension keeps code concise.  
- Integer division (`//`) automatically floors the result.  
- Handles empty list with a short ternary expression.

---

### C++ (C++17)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int averageValue(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long sum = 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
            if (n % 6 == 0) {      // even & divisible by 3
                sum += n;
                ++cnt;
            }
        }
        return cnt ? static_cast<int>(sum / cnt) : 0;
    }
};
```

**Why it’s good**  
- Uses `long long` for safe summation.  
- Compact for‑loop style that compilers can optimise well.  
- Avoids the overhead of STL algorithms for this tiny task.

## 🔍 The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Algorithmic Complexity** | O(n) time, O(1) space – optimal | – | – |
| **Edge Cases** | Handles empty result (returns 0) | None | - |
| **Readability** | Clear condition `n % 6 == 0` | Over‑complicated nested loops | Using bitwise tricks (e.g., `n & 1`) can hurt clarity |
| **Performance** | Single pass, constant memory | – | Micro‑optimisations (e.g., unrolled loops) add noise with no real benefit |
| **Portability** | Works across Java, Python, C++ | – | None |
| **Maintainability** | Straightforward, no hidden magic | – | None |

### What to keep

- The simple `n % 6 == 0` check – it’s both expressive and efficient.  
- Integer division (`//` in Python, `/` in Java/C++) for floor rounding.  
- Avoid unnecessary collections; accumulate sum & count in one pass.

### What to avoid

- Complex conditionals or early returns that clutter the logic.  
- Premature micro‑optimisation; the input size (≤ 1000) is tiny, so readability wins.  
- Over‑engineering with streams or regex when a plain loop is clearer.
