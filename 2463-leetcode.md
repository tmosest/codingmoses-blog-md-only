### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Recap

You‚Äôre given

| `robot`  | `factory` |
|----------|-----------|
| `robot[i]` ‚Äì the X‚Äëaxis position of robot *i* | `factory[j] = [posj, limitj]` ‚Äì position and how many robots this factory can repair |

All robots start broken and are free to choose **one** direction (left or right) at the very beginning.  
They move at the same speed, never collide, and stop when they reach a factory that still has a spare slot.  
If a factory‚Äôs limit is reached, the robot simply passes by it.

**Goal:**  
Set the initial directions so that *every* robot gets repaired and the **total distance traveled** is **minimum**.

> **Constraints**  
> ‚Ä¢ `1¬†‚â§¬†robot.length, factory.length¬†‚â§¬†100`  
> ‚Ä¢ `-10‚Åπ¬†‚â§¬†robot[i], factory[j][0]¬†‚â§¬†10‚Åπ`  
> ‚Ä¢ `0¬†‚â§¬†factory[j][1]¬†‚â§¬†robot.length`  
> ‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs always possible to repair all robots.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why It Looks Hard

The robots are free to walk in either direction, and factories have different capacities.  
A naive ‚Äúsend each robot to its nearest factory‚Äù is wrong because a factory‚Äôs capacity may be exhausted, forcing a robot to go farther.

The key insight:  
**Once the robots and factories are sorted on the X‚Äëaxis, the optimal assignment will always use a *contiguous block* of robots for each factory.**  
Why?  
Moving a robot left while a closer robot goes right would increase the total distance due to the convexity of the absolute value function.  

With this property we can solve the problem by dynamic programming over sorted positions.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Solution Overview (DP)

1. **Sort**  
   * `robots` ‚Äì ascending by position  
   * `factories` ‚Äì ascending by position  

2. **DP State**  
   `dp[i][j]` ‚Äì minimal total distance to repair the first `i` robots using the first `j` factories (all `i` robots are guaranteed to be repaired).

3. **Transition**  
   For each factory `j` we decide how many of the last `k` robots (`k` from `0` to `limit[j]`) are repaired by it:

   ```text
   dp[i][j] = min over k ( dp[i-k][j-1] + cost(robots[i-k+1 ‚Ä¶ i] ‚Üí factory[j]) )
   ```

4. **Cost**  
   `cost(l ‚Ä¶ r ‚Üí pos)` = Œ£ |robots[p] ‚Äì pos| for p = l ‚Ä¶ r.  
   Since `m ‚â§ 100`, we can compute this in O(m) on the fly; it‚Äôs cheap and keeps the implementation simple.

5. **Answer**  
   `dp[m][n]` where `m = robots.size()` and `n = factories.size()`.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Correctness Proof (Sketch)

*Lemma 1 ‚Äì Contiguous Assignment*  
For any optimal solution, if robots `a < b < c` are repaired by factory `f` and `d` (`a < d < b`) is repaired by another factory, swapping `d` with `b` cannot increase the total distance.  
Proof uses the triangle inequality and the convexity of |x ‚Äì y|.  
Thus an optimal solution can be re‚Äëordered so that robots assigned to a given factory form a contiguous block.

*Lemma 2 ‚Äì DP Recurrence*  
Assume we have repaired the first `i-k` robots using the first `j-1` factories optimally (`dp[i-k][j-1]`).  
Adding factory `j` to repair robots `i-k+1 ‚Ä¶ i` yields a valid solution for the first `i` robots using first `j` factories, and its cost is exactly the transition expression.  
Any optimal solution must be constructed this way because of Lemma‚ÄØ1.  
Therefore, `dp[i][j]` stores the optimal cost for that subproblem.

*Theorem* ‚Äì `dp[m][n]` equals the minimum total distance required to repair all robots.  
By induction on `i` and `j`, the DP explores all feasible allocations respecting factory limits, and by Lemma‚ÄØ2 every optimal allocation is considered.  
Hence the algorithm is correct. ‚àé

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Complexity Analysis

| Step | Complexity |
|------|------------|
| Sorting robots | `O(m log m)` |
| Sorting factories | `O(n log n)` |
| DP loops | `O(m ¬∑ n ¬∑ maxLimit)` ‚â§ `O(100 ¬∑ 100 ¬∑ 100) = 10‚Å∂` |
| Cost calculation per transition | `O(m)` but amortized constant because of small constraints |
| **Total** | `O(10‚Å∂)` time, `O(m ¬∑ n)` memory (~10‚Å¥) |

Both are easily within the limits for Java, Python, and C++.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Edge Cases & Pitfalls

| Bad practice | What goes wrong | Fix |
|--------------|-----------------|-----|
| Not sorting first | Assignments can cross factories, leading to sub‚Äëoptimal or invalid solutions | Sort both arrays |
| Forgetting that a robot may start *at* a factory | Missing the zero‚Äëdistance case | Handle `|robot - factory| = 0` automatically |
| Using a greedy ‚Äúnearest factory‚Äù | Violates capacity constraints, increases distance | Use DP as described |
| Over‚Äëoptimizing cost calculation with complex math | Introduces bugs, hard to read | Compute with a simple loop; constraints are tiny |

#### üî∑ Java (Java‚ÄØ17)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public long minimumTotalDistance(List<Integer> robot, int[][] factory) {
        int m = robot.size();
        int n = factory.length;

        // 1. Sort robots and factories by position
        Collections.sort(robot);
        Arrays.sort(factory, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));

        // Convert robots to array for fast indexing
        long[] r = new long[m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) r[i] = robot.get(i);

        // 2. DP table (use long to avoid overflow)
        long[][] dp = new long[m + 1][n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= m; ++i)
            Arrays.fill(dp[i], Long.MAX_VALUE / 4);
        dp[0][0] = 0;

        // 3. DP transition
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            int pos = factory[j - 1][0];
            int limit = factory[j - 1][1];

            for (int i = 0; i <= m; ++i) {
                // consider assigning k robots (0..limit) to this factory
                for (int k = 0; k <= limit && k <= i; ++k) {
                    long prev = dp[i - k][j - 1];
                    if (prev == Long.MAX_VALUE / 4) continue;

                    // cost of moving robots (i-k .. i-1) to this factory
                    long cost = 0;
                    for (int p = i - k; p < i; ++p)
                        cost += Math.abs(r[p] - pos);

                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], prev + cost);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```

#### üî∂ Python (Python¬†3.11)

```python
from typing import List
import math

class Solution:
    def minimumTotalDistance(self, robot: List[int], factory: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        robot.sort()
        factory.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

        m, n = len(robot), len(factory)
        r = robot

        INF = 10 ** 18
        dp = [[INF] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 0

        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            pos, limit = factory[j - 1]
            for i in range(m + 1):
                for k in range(limit + 1):
                    if k > i: break
                    if dp[i - k][j - 1] == INF: continue
                    cost = sum(abs(r[p] - pos) for p in range(i - k, i))
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - k][j - 1] + cost)

        return dp[m][n]
```

---

#### üîó C++ (C++17)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumTotalDistance(vector<int> robot, vector<vector<int>> factory) {
        sort(robot.begin(), robot.end());
        sort(factory.begin(), factory.end(),
             [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b){ return a[0] < b[0]; });

        int m = robot.size(), n = factory.size();
        vector<long long> r(robot.begin(), robot.end());

        const long long INF = 4e18;
        vector<vector<long long>> dp(m + 1, vector<long long>(n + 1, INF));
        dp[0][0] = 0;

        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            int pos = factory[j-1][0];
            int limit = factory[j-1][1];
            for (int i = 0; i <= m; ++i) {
                for (int k = 0; k <= limit && k <= i; ++k) {
                    if (dp[i-k][j-1] == INF) continue;
                    long long cost = 0;
                    for (int p = i-k; p < i; ++p)
                        cost += llabs(r[p] - pos);
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-k][j-1] + cost);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```

> **Note:**  
> All three implementations use a triple‚Äënested loop but stay comfortably inside the **10‚Å∂** operation budget because `m, n ‚â§ 100`.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ What Makes This Solution Stand Out

| **Good** | **Bad** | **Ugly** |
|----------|---------|----------|
| ‚Ä¢ Intuitive DP after sorting. | ‚Ä¢ Forgetting to handle negative coordinates ‚Äì can lead to overflow or wrong results. | ‚Ä¢ Capacity handling can be subtle: a factory may repair **zero** robots, so we must allow `k = 0`. |
| ‚Ä¢ Cost computed with a simple loop ‚Äì no tricky math. | ‚Ä¢ Greedy ‚Äúnearest factory‚Äù is tempting but wrong. | ‚Ä¢ A lot of people over‚Äëoptimize DP and make the code unreadable. |
| ‚Ä¢ Works in all major languages with minimal extra memory. | ‚Ä¢ Not using `long` / `long long` may overflow on large coordinates. | ‚Ä¢ Mixing indices (`1‚Äëbased` vs `0‚Äëbased`) can be confusing. |

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Bonus: Faster Cost (Optional)

If you‚Äôd like to reduce the constant factor, you can pre‚Äëcompute prefix sums of robot positions and then use the formula  

```
cost(l ‚Ä¶ r ‚Üí pos) =
    (pos * k) - (prefix[r] - prefix[l-1])   if robots are to the left of pos
    (prefix[r] - prefix[l-1]) - (pos * k)   otherwise
```

but for the given limits the simple loop is **clearer** and less error‚Äëprone.
