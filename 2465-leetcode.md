## 📝 Problem Summary

Given an **even‑length** array `nums` (2 ≤ `nums.length` ≤ 100, each element 0–100), repeatedly

1. Remove the *smallest* number
2. Remove the *largest* number
3. Compute their average `(a + b) / 2`

Return the **count of distinct averages** produced.

> Example  
> `nums = [4,1,4,0,3,5]` → averages: 2.5, 2.5, 3.5 → answer `2`.

---

## 🔍 Intuition

The process is deterministic up to ties (any min/max may be chosen).  
If we **sort** the array, the smallest and largest are simply `nums[0]` and `nums[n‑1]`.  
After pairing them, we can just move inward: `l++` and `r--`.  
Each pair yields one average; we just need to count how many **unique** averages we get.

---

## ⚡️ Brute‑Force vs. Optimal

| Approach | Time | Space | Comments |
|----------|------|-------|----------|
| Remove min/max from a multiset each step (heap, list) | **O(n²)** | **O(n)** | Too slow, unnecessary. |
| **Sort + two pointers + hash set** | **O(n log n)** | **O(n)** | Optimal for given constraints. |

---

## 📦 Implementation

Below are clean, self‑contained solutions in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
All three use the same algorithmic idea.

---

### Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int distinctAverages(int[] nums) {
        // 1. Sort to bring min & max to the ends
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        // 2. Use a HashSet to keep unique averages
        Set<Double> set = new HashSet<>();

        int l = 0, r = nums.length - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            // Double is fine – values are at most 100, average ends in .0 or .5
            double avg = (nums[l] + nums[r]) / 2.0;
            set.add(avg);
            l++;
            r--;
        }
        return set.size();
    }
}
```

> **Why `double`?**  
> With the given limits, the sum is ≤ 200 and division by 2 gives either an integer or a .5 decimal.  
> `double`’s precision is far beyond that, so there is no risk of two distinct averages colliding.

---

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def distinctAverages(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        seen = set()
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            avg = (nums[l] + nums[r]) / 2.0
            seen.add(avg)
            l += 1
            r -= 1
        return len(seen)
```

> **`set`** in Python is a hash‑set with amortised O(1) inserts.  
> The code follows the same two‑pointer pattern.

---

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int distinctAverages(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        unordered_set<double> seen;
        for (int l = 0, r = nums.size() - 1; l < r; ++l, --r) {
            double avg = (nums[l] + nums[r]) / 2.0;
            seen.insert(avg);
        }
        return seen.size();
    }
};
```

> **`unordered_set`** gives O(1) average insert/lookup.  
> Using `double` is safe for the same reason as Java.

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

| Step | Cost | Explanation |
|------|------|-------------|
| Sort `nums` | **O(n log n)** | `n` ≤ 100, but this dominates |
| Two‑pointer loop | **O(n)** | One pass, constant work |
| HashSet operations | **O(n)** | Each insert/lookup is O(1) on average |

**Total:** `O(n log n)` time, `O(n)` space.

With `n` ≤ 100, all solutions run in milliseconds (< 5 ms in practice).

---

## 🤔 Edge Cases & Pitfalls

| Issue | How to Avoid |
|-------|--------------|
| **Floating‑point equality** | All averages are exact multiples of 0.5; `double` comparison is safe. |
| **Ties for min/max** | Any choice works; sorting resolves deterministically. |
| **Empty array** | Problem guarantees even length ≥ 2, so no need for special handling. |
| **Large values** | Constraints ensure `int` + `int` fits in 32‑bit. |
| **Memory usage** | `HashSet` holds at most `n/2` elements, tiny for given limits. |

---

## 🐞 The “Ugly” Part

- If you tried to keep the array as a multiset and repeatedly `pollFirst()` / `pollLast()` using a `TreeSet`, you'd get a **log n** operation for each pair – *still* acceptable for 100 elements, but unnecessary complexity.
- Using a `double` in a `HashSet` can be risky in other contexts (e.g., with large numbers or many decimal places). Here the small domain guarantees safety.
- Some interviewers expect you to realize the **two‑pointer** pattern **before** you write code. Skipping this insight may lead to over‑engineering.

---

## ✅ The “Good” Things

- **Simplicity** – Sort once, loop once, set once.
- **Deterministic** – No randomness; easy to test.
- **Scalable** – Works for much larger arrays if constraints grow.

---

## 📚 Takeaway Checklist

- [ ] Sort the array.
- [ ] Pair elements from the two ends (`l` and `r`).
- [ ] Compute average as a `double` (or `float`).
- [ ] Store in a hash set to keep uniques.
- [ ] Return the set’s size.

### Introduction

The “Number of Distinct Averages” problem is a deceptively simple LeetCode challenge that tests your understanding of sorting, two‑pointer technique, and hashing. In this article we’ll walk through the problem, the intuition behind the optimal solution, provide clean code in **Java, Python, and C++**, analyze its complexity, and discuss common pitfalls—all while keeping the article SEO‑friendly to help you land that job interview.

---

### Problem Recap

> **Goal**: Remove the minimum and maximum from an even‑length array repeatedly, calculate each pair’s average, and count how many distinct averages are produced.

**Constraints**

- `2 ≤ nums.length ≤ 100`, even
- `0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100`

---

### The Optimal Strategy

1. **Sort** the array.  
   Now the smallest is at index `0`, largest at index `n‑1`.
2. Use two pointers (`l` at the start, `r` at the end).  
   Each step:
   - Compute `(nums[l] + nums[r]) / 2.0`.
   - Insert into a hash set.
   - Move `l++`, `r--`.
3. After the loop, the hash set size is the answer.

Why is this optimal?  
Because each pair is independent; sorting places each min/max pair in fixed positions, eliminating the need for expensive data structures like priority queues. The hash set guarantees uniqueness in expected O(1) time.

> **Tip**: In languages that support it, you can also use a `pair<int, int>` as the key instead of a `double` to avoid any floating‑point concerns.

---

### Complexity

- **Time**: `O(n log n)` (sorting dominates).  
- **Space**: `O(n)` (hash set holds at most `n/2` averages).

---

### Edge Cases & Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Using a `TreeSet` and removing min/max via `pollFirst()/pollLast()` | Sort once + two pointers (much simpler). |
| Forgetting to divide by `2.0` (integer division) | Use `double` or cast to double. |
| Storing averages in an `int` or `float` that cannot represent `.5` precisely | Use `double` or store as a string `"x.5"` or integer‑scaled value. |
| Over‑thinking “ties” for min/max | Sorting gives deterministic answer; any tie choice is fine. |

---

### The “Good” and “Ugly” Discussion

- **Good**: The solution is concise, runs instantly even on the upper bound, and clearly demonstrates algorithmic thinking.
- **Ugly**: Over‑engineering (priority queues, custom heap) distracts from the core two‑pointer insight. In interviews, highlight the insight before code.

---

### Interview Tips

1. **Explain the two‑pointer approach before coding** – shows you grasp the underlying pattern.
2. **Mention the hash set’s uniqueness guarantee** – interviewers appreciate understanding of data structures.
3. **Show confidence with floating‑point safety** – clarify why `double` is fine given the constraints.
4. **Discuss scalability** – if constraints increased to `10^5`, the approach still works (sorting remains O(n log n)).

---

### Closing Thoughts

LeetCode 2465 is a great example of how a clear algorithmic strategy (sort + two pointers + hash set) beats more complex data‑structure solutions. By mastering this trick, you’ll be ready to solve similar “pair‑based” problems in interviews, and you’ll have clean, production‑ready code in Java, Python, or C++.

### FAQs

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| *Does integer division affect the result?* | Yes, `(nums[l] + nums[r]) / 2` would produce an integer. Always use `2.0` or cast to `double`. |
| *Can I use `int` for the hash key?* | Since sums are ≤ 200, you can store the *scaled* sum (`nums[l] + nums[r]`) in an `int` and later divide when returning the result. |
| *Is the algorithm stable?* | Sorting is stable, but not required. Two pointers produce a deterministic pair ordering. |
