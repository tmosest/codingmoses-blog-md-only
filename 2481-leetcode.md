## 🚀 Problem Recap

| Name | LeetCode # | Difficulty |
|------|------------|------------|
| Minimum Cuts to Divide a Circle | 2481 | Easy |

**What you’re asked to do**

> Given an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), return the *minimum* number of straight‑line cuts required to split a circle into `n` equal‑sized slices.  
>  
> *A cut can be:*
> 1. A line through the center touching two points on the circumference (a *diameter*).  
> 2. A line touching one point on the circumference and passing through the center (a *half‑diameter*).  

**Key observation**

- If `n` is **odd**, every slice must have an *odd* number of sides; you can’t get them by a single diameter cut.  
- If `n` is **even**, a single diameter cuts the circle into two equal halves; repeating the process `n/2` times gives `n` slices.

## 🎯 The Sweet Spot: O(1) Closed‑Form

| `n` | Cuts |
|-----|------|
| 1   | 0 |
| odd | n |
| even | n / 2 |

So the algorithm is just a handful of lines:

```text
if n == 1           → 0
else if n is even   → n / 2
else                → n
```

All in constant time and space.

## 🏗️ Code Snippets (Three Languages)

### 1. Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfCuts(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 0;          // No cut needed
        return n % 2 == 0 ? n / 2 : n; // Even → halve, Odd → n cuts
    }
}
```

### 2. Python

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfCuts(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        return n // 2 if n % 2 == 0 else n
```

### 3. C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfCuts(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        return n % 2 ? n : n / 2;
    }
};
```

> **Why these are *job‑ready*:**
> * **Readability** – Clear comments, no magic numbers.  
> * **Performance** – O(1) time, O(1) space – perfect for interview grading.  
> * **Idiomatic** – Leverages language strengths (ternary in Java, integer division in Python, concise return in C++).

## ⚙️ The “Good” – What Makes This Code Excellent

| ✅ | Explanation |
|---|-------------|
| **Simplicity** | Only one `if` and one ternary. |
| **Deterministic** | No loops, no recursion. |
| **Maintainability** | A single line of logic; future changes are trivial. |
| **Test‑friendly** | Easy to unit‑test each branch. |

---

## ⚠️ The “Bad” – What to Avoid (and Why)

| ❌ | Pitfall |
|---|----------|
| **Naïve simulation** | Counting cuts by actually drawing lines leads to O(n²) or worse. |
| **Over‑complicated math** | Using trigonometry or combinatorics is unnecessary and error‑prone. |
| **Ignoring the `n==1` case** | Many candidates forget that 1 slice needs no cut. |

---

## 💔 The “Ugly” – Common Missteps

| 🤡 | Description |
|---|--------------|
| **Hard‑coding a lookup table** | While it works for small `n`, it breaks for larger inputs and defeats the purpose of an algorithmic solution. |
| **Using floating‑point division** | `n/2` in languages where `n` is `int` might cast to float and cause rounding errors. |
| **Over‑optimizing prematurely** | Adding caching or memoization when the function is already O(1) provides no benefit and complicates the code. |

## 📚 Understanding the Geometry (Optional)

> **Why even `n` needs `n/2` cuts?**  
> A single diameter divides the circle into two halves. If you want `n` equal slices where `n` is even, you need to repeat the diameter cut `n/2` times, each time rotating the diameter by `180° / (n/2)` to avoid overlapping cuts.

---

## 🧪 Quick Test Cases

| Input | Output | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 0 | No cut needed |
| 2 | 1 | One diameter yields two halves |
| 3 | 3 | Odd → need one cut per slice |
| 4 | 2 | Even → `4/2 = 2` cuts |
| 5 | 5 | Odd → 5 cuts |
| 6 | 3 | Even → `6/2 = 3` cuts |

Run them with the provided code snippets to confirm correctness.

## 🏁 Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Java | Python | C++ |
|--------|------|--------|-----|
| Time   | O(1) | O(1)   | O(1) |
| Space  | O(1) | O(1)   | O(1) |

> **Why it matters:** Interviewers love algorithms that are *clean* and *fast*. This solution wins both categories.

## 🎓 How to Explain This in an Interview

1. **State the problem in your own words** – “Given `n`, find min cuts to split the circle into `n` equal sectors.”
2. **Show the observation** – “If `n` is odd we can’t use a diameter, so we need a cut for every slice. If `n` is even we can pair slices with a single diameter, cutting `n/2` times.”
3. **Present the formula** – “`n == 1 → 0`, else `n%2 == 0 → n/2`, else `n`.”
4. **Write the code** – Highlight the concise `if` statements.
5. **Mention edge cases** – `n == 1`, large `n`, language quirks.
6. **Wrap up** – Complexity and why this is optimal.
