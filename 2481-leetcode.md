        ## LeetCode 2481 – Minimum Cuts to Divide a Circle  
**Easy | Time O(1) | Space O(1)**  

---

### TL;DR  
```java
public int numberOfCuts(int n) {
    if (n == 1) return 0;          // already one slice
    return n % 2 == 0 ? n/2 : n;   // even → half the cuts, odd → one per slice
}
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfCuts(self, n: int) -> int:
        return 0 if n == 1 else n if n % 2 else n // 2
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfCuts(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        return n % 2 ? n : n/2;
    }
};
```

## Why This Matters for Your Coding Interview

- **Short, clean code** that runs in constant time – interviewers love concise solutions.  
- Demonstrates *mathematical insight* and *edge‑case awareness* – key traits for a backend or algorithm engineer.  
- Fits perfectly into a **60‑minute interview** or as a *take‑home* solution on LeetCode.

## Problem Statement (from LeetCode)

> A **valid cut** in a circle can be:
> 1. A straight line that touches two points on the edge of the circle and passes through its center (a diameter).
> 2. A straight line that touches one point on the edge of the circle and its center.
> 
> Given an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), return the minimum number of cuts needed to divide the circle into **n equal slices**.  
> The first cut will not produce a new slice (the circle stays whole after the first cut).

Examples  
| n | Output | Explanation |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 4 | 2 | Two diameter cuts give 4 equal slices. |
| 3 | 3 | Three one‑point cuts are needed; no pair of diameter cuts works. |

---

## Intuition & Key Observation

1. **Odd `n`**  
   - Every cut that passes through the center can only bisect the circle into *two* equal halves.  
   - To get an odd number of slices, you can’t rely on a diameter.  
   - Each cut must *create a new slice*, so you need exactly `n` cuts.  
   - Example: `n = 3` → 3 cuts, one per slice.

2. **Even `n`**  
   - You can use a diameter to split the circle into two equal halves.  
   - After the first diameter cut, each half can be divided further using the same strategy.  
   - Effectively, you need half as many cuts as the number of slices: `n / 2`.  
   - Example: `n = 6` → 3 cuts (`6/2`), not 6.

3. **`n = 1`**  
   - No cuts needed – the circle is already one slice.  

So the solution is a single line of conditional logic.

## Edge‑Case Discussion

| n | Expected Cuts | Reason |
|---|---------------|--------|
| 1 | 0 | Already a single slice. |
| 2 | 1 | One diameter cut. |
| 3 | 3 | Odd, cannot use diameter pairs. |
| 4 | 2 | `4 / 2`. |
| 100 | 50 | Even, `100 / 2`. |

All test cases pass with the O(1) formula.

## Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```
function numberOfCuts(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    else if n is even:
        return n / 2
    else:
        return n
```

---

## Code Implementations

### Java
```java
public class Solution {
    public int numberOfCuts(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        return n % 2 == 0 ? n / 2 : n;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfCuts(self, n: int) -> int:
        return 0 if n == 1 else n if n % 2 else n // 2
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfCuts(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        return n % 2 ? n : n / 2;
    }
};
```

All three snippets compile and run in **O(1)** time and use **O(1)** memory.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time**: `O(1)` – a few arithmetic operations, no loops.  
- **Space**: `O(1)` – constant auxiliary memory.  

---

## Sample Test Cases

```text
Input:  n = 1
Output: 0

Input:  n = 2
Output: 1

Input:  n = 3
Output: 3

Input:  n = 4
Output: 2

Input:  n = 6
Output: 3

Input:  n = 7
Output: 7

Input:  n = 100
Output: 50
```

Run them in your IDE or the LeetCode platform; all should pass instantly.

## Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Why it fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `return n / 2` for all `n` | Odd numbers need more cuts | Add a check for parity |
| `return n` for all `n` | Even numbers are over‑cut | Use `n/2` when `n` is even |
| Forgetting `n == 1` | Returns 1 instead of 0 | Special‑case the base case |

## Why This Solution is Interview‑Ready

1. **Clarity** – one conditional branch, no loops.  
2. **Mathematical Elegance** – shows understanding of symmetry and parity.  
3. **Edge‑Case Handling** – demonstrates awareness of boundary values.  
4. **Performance** – constant time and memory guarantee no timeout or MLE.  

Presenting this solution in an interview showcases *algorithmic thinking* and *code brevity*, both highly valued by hiring managers.

## Final Thoughts

The “Minimum Cuts to Divide a Circle” problem is deceptively simple once you realize the parity trick.  
- **Even `n`** → use diameters → `n/2` cuts.  
- **Odd `n`** → each slice must be cut separately → `n` cuts.  
- **`n = 1`** → no cuts.

Remember to keep your code tight, document the parity logic, and you’ll impress interviewers with both correctness and elegance. Happy coding!
