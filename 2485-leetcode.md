## 1.  The Code – 3 Languages in One

Below are three **ready‑to‑run** solutions for LeetCode #2485 – *Find the Pivot Integer*.  
Each implementation follows the same O(1) math‑based logic, but they are written in Java, Python, and C++ so you can copy‑paste them into the language of your choice.

> **Key Idea**  
> Let  
> *S(n) = 1 + 2 + … + n = n(n+1)/2*  
> For a pivot *x* we need  
> `S(x) = x(x+1)/2`  =  `S(n) – S(x-1)`  
> Simplifying gives **x² = n(n+1)/2** → *x = sqrt(n(n+1)/2)*.  
> If that square root is an integer, that integer is the pivot; otherwise there is no pivot.

### Java

```java
//  LeetCode 2485 – Find the Pivot Integer (Java)
class Solution {
    public int pivotInteger(int n) {
        // Sum of 1..n
        int total = n * (n + 1) / 2;
        // Exact integer square root of total
        int root = (int) Math.round(Math.sqrt(total));

        // Check that root*root == total (no floating point drift)
        return (root * root == total) ? root : -1;
    }
}
```

---

### Python

```python
#  LeetCode 2485 – Find the Pivot Integer (Python 3)
class Solution:
    def pivotInteger(self, n: int) -> int:
        total = n * (n + 1) // 2          # sum 1..n
        root = int(round(total ** 0.5))   # integer square root
        return root if root * root == total else -1
```

---

### C++

```cpp
//  LeetCode 2485 – Find the Pivot Integer (C++)
class Solution {
public:
    int pivotInteger(int n) {
        long long total = 1LL * n * (n + 1) / 2;           // sum 1..n
        long long root  = llround(sqrt((long double)total)); // integer sqrt
        return (root * root == total) ? (int)root : -1;
    }
};
```

> **Why `llround` / `round`?**  
> For safety against floating‑point drift we round the square root back to the nearest integer and then verify `root*root == total`.  
> (With `n ≤ 1000` all arithmetic stays comfortably inside 64‑bit.)

### 1. Introduction

In the world of coding interviews, LeetCode’s “Find the Pivot Integer” (Problem 2485) is a deceptively simple *Easy* problem that often catches candidates off guard.  
The goal is to find an integer `x` such that the sum of all integers from `1` to `x` equals the sum from `x` to `n`. If no such integer exists, return `-1`.  

> **Why this problem matters**  
> 1. **Math intuition** – Demonstrates your ability to turn a verbal problem into algebra.  
> 2. **Time/Space mastery** – Shows you can produce an O(1) solution.  
> 3. **Precision handling** – Tests awareness of floating‑point quirks.

---

### 2. Problem Statement (Plain English)

> *Given a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), find the pivot integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ n) such that:*

> `1 + 2 + … + x  =  x + (x+1) + … + n`

> *Return `x`. If there is no such integer, return `-1`.*

### 3. The Good – A Clean, O(1) Math‑Based Solution

#### 3.1 Derivation

1. Sum of first `k` integers: `S(k) = k(k+1)/2`.  
2. Pivot condition: `S(x) = S(n) – S(x-1)`  
   → `x(x+1)/2 = n(n+1)/2 – (x-1)x/2`  
3. Simplify → `x² = n(n+1)/2`  
4. Pivot candidate: `x = sqrt( n(n+1)/2 )`  

If the square root is an integer, that integer is the pivot. Otherwise, no pivot exists.

#### 3.2 Implementation Highlights

- Compute `total = n*(n+1)/2`.  
- Take an integer square root (`root = round(sqrt(total))`).  
- Verify `root * root == total`.  
- Return `root` or `-1`.

All operations are **O(1)** in time and **O(1)** in space.

*(See the Java/Python/C++ code above.)*

### 4. The Bad – A Naïve O(n) Loop

A quick but inefficient approach is to loop through every `x` from `1` to `n`, compute both sums, and compare.  
While correct, it runs in O(n) time, which is unnecessary for `n ≤ 1000` but still considered a *bad* solution because:

- **Missed opportunity** to showcase mathematical thinking.  
- In interview settings, a naïve solution may raise concerns about algorithmic efficiency.

**Pseudo‑code**:

```text
for x in 1..n:
    left  = x*(x+1)/2
    right = total - (x-1)*x/2
    if left == right: return x
return -1
```

---

### 5. The Ugly – Floating‑Point Pitfalls

If you compute the square root using a floating‑point type (`double` or `float`) and then cast to `int`, you risk:

- **Precision errors** (e.g., sqrt(36) might become 5.99999998).  
- **Wrong pivot detection** (failing to recognize that 6 is a valid pivot).

**What to avoid**:

```java
int root = (int) Math.sqrt(total); // unsafe
```

**What to do instead**:

1. Round the square root (`Math.round()` / `llround`).  
2. Verify with integer multiplication (`root * root == total`).

### 6. Time & Space Complexity

| Approach | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| O(1) Math | **O(1)** | **O(1)** |
| Naïve loop | **O(n)** | **O(1)** |
| Binary search | **O(log n)** | **O(1)** |

Given `n ≤ 1000`, all solutions finish instantly, but the O(1) approach is the gold standard for interviews.

---

### 7. Variations & Extensions

1. **Large `n` (e.g., 10⁹)** – Use 64‑bit arithmetic to avoid overflow.  
2. **Multiple test cases** – Precompute sums once if many queries share the same `n`.  
3. **Floating‑point comparison** – For languages without integer sqrt, use `floor` + check or `isclose` in Python.

### 8. Interview Tips

| Scenario | What to Say | Why it Helps |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Asked to code in Java | "I'll use the closed‑form derivation and verify the root with integer math." | Shows you understand the math and precision. |
| Asked for complexity | "O(1) time and space, because we compute a single formula." | Demonstrates algorithmic efficiency. |
| Asked about edge cases | "For `n = 1`, the pivot is 1; for `n` where `n(n+1)/2` is not a perfect square, we return -1." | Highlights comprehensive handling. |
| Asked about overflow | "Since `n ≤ 1000`, 32‑bit ints are safe, but for safety I'd use long in C++/Java." | Shows defensive coding. |
