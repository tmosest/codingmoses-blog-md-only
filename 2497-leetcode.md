        ## 1. Problem Recap – LeetCode 2497  
**Maximum Star Sum of a Graph**

*We have an undirected graph.  
`vals[i]` – value of node `i`.  
`edges` – list of undirected edges.  
A *star* is a sub‑graph that has one center node and any number of its incident edges (all sharing the same center).  
For a given integer `k` we want the maximum possible star sum (sum of all node values that appear in the star) using **at most `k` edges**.*

> **Input**  
> `int[] vals, int[][] edges, int k`  
> **Output** – maximum star sum

**Constraints**  

| n = |vals| | 1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵ | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
