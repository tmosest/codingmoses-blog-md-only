        # 1.  The Code ‚Äì 2507. Smallest Value After Replacing With Sum of Prime Factors  

Below are three clean, production‚Äëready implementations (Java, Python, C++).  
Each one follows the same algorithmic idea:

1. **Prime‚Äëfactorise `n`.**  
   Sum the prime factors *with multiplicity*.  
2. **Replace `n` by that sum.**  
3. **Repeat until the sum equals `n`** ‚Äì this happens only when `n` is prime.  
4. **Return the prime that the process converges to.**

All solutions run in \(O(\sqrt{n})\) per iteration and converge in at most a handful of iterations because the value of `n` monotonically decreases until it becomes prime.  
For the given constraint \(2 \le n \le 10^5\) the runtime is trivial ‚Äì far below 1‚ÄØms in practice.

## 1.1  Java 17

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    /**
     * Returns the smallest value reachable by repeatedly replacing
     * n with the sum of its prime factors.
     */
    public int smallestValue(int n) {
        while (true) {
            int sum = primeFactorSum(n);
            if (sum == n) {          // n is prime ‚Äì stable
                return n;
            }
            n = sum;                  // continue with the new value
        }
    }

    /** Helper: sum of prime factors (with multiplicity). */
    private int primeFactorSum(int x) {
        int sum = 0;
        int num = x;

        // handle factor 2 separately to skip even numbers
        while (num % 2 == 0) {
            sum += 2;
            num /= 2;
        }

        // only odd factors remain
        for (int i = 3; i * i <= num; i += 2) {
            while (num % i == 0) {
                sum += i;
                num /= i;
            }
        }

        // if any prime > sqrt(x) remains
        if (num > 1) sum += num;

        return sum;
    }

    // --------------------------------------------------
    // Optional: a main method for quick manual testing
    // --------------------------------------------------
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution s = new Solution();
        System.out.println(s.smallestValue(15)); // 5
        System.out.println(s.smallestValue(3));  // 3
    }
}
```

**Key Points**

- Uses **trial division** (optimized by skipping even numbers).  
- Works in **constant extra space** ‚Äì only a few integer variables.  
- Very readable and easy to audit ‚Äì perfect for an interview.

## 1.2  Python 3

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestValue(self, n: int) -> int:
        """
        Return the smallest value obtainable by repeatedly replacing
        n with the sum of its prime factors.
        """
        while True:
            s = self._prime_factor_sum(n)
            if s == n:          # n is prime
                return n
            n = s

    def _prime_factor_sum(self, x: int) -> int:
        """Return the sum of prime factors of x (with multiplicity)."""
        total = 0
        num = x

        # factor 2
        while num % 2 == 0:
            total += 2
            num //= 2

        # odd factors
        f = 3
        while f * f <= num:
            while num % f == 0:
                total += f
                num //= f
            f += 2

        if num > 1:
            total += num
        return total
```

**Pythonic Highlights**

- Helper function keeps the core logic readable.  
- Uses integer arithmetic only; no external libraries required.  
- The algorithm is O(‚àön) and runs in microseconds for `n <= 10^5`.

## 1.3  C++ (C++17)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int smallestValue(int n) {
        while (true) {
            int sum = primeFactorSum(n);
            if (sum == n)          // n is prime
                return n;
            n = sum;               // continue
        }
    }

private:
    int primeFactorSum(int x) {
        int sum = 0;
        int num = x;

        // factor 2
        while (num % 2 == 0) {
            sum += 2;
            num /= 2;
        }

        // odd factors
        for (int i = 3; 1LL * i * i <= num; i += 2) {
            while (num % i == 0) {
                sum += i;
                num /= i;
            }
        }

        if (num > 1) sum += num; // remaining prime factor > sqrt(x)
        return sum;
    }
};
```

**C++ Notes**

- Uses `1LL * i * i` to avoid overflow (though not needed for `n ‚â§ 1e5`).  
- All logic lives in a single method ‚Äì great for interview style.  
- Compiles with `-std=c++17` (or `-std=c++20` if you prefer).

# LeetCode 2507 ‚Äì Smallest Value After Replacing With Sum of Prime Factors  
**The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly ‚Äì Java, Python, C++ Solutions & Interview Tips**

---

## üìå Problem Recap

You‚Äôre given an integer `n (2 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ)`.  
Repeatedly replace `n` with the sum of its prime factors (counting multiplicity).  
Return the smallest value that `n` will ever take on.

> **Example**  
> `n = 15 ‚Üí 3 + 5 = 8 ‚Üí 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 ‚Üí 2 + 3 = 5`.  
> The answer is `5`.

---

## üîé Intuition

- **Prime numbers stay the same**:  
  The sum of the prime factors of a prime `p` is `p` itself.  
- **Composite numbers shrink**:  
  For any composite `m`, the sum of its prime factors is strictly smaller than `m`.  
- **Convergence**:  
  Therefore the sequence `n, f(n), f(f(n)), ‚Ä¶` is strictly decreasing until it reaches a prime, which is the fixed point.  

Hence the answer is simply the first prime you encounter when repeatedly applying the ‚Äúprime‚Äëfactor sum‚Äù function.

---

## üëç The Good

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **O(‚àön) per step** | With `n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`, each factorisation takes at most ~300 iterations. |
| **Constant space** | Only a handful of integers ‚Äì perfect for interview constraints. |
| **Language‚Äëagnostic** | Same logic in Java, Python, C++. |
| **Readable code** | Clear separation of factorisation and loop. |

---

## ‚ùå The Bad

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Na√Øve trial division** | Use step‚Äë2 for odd numbers to halve the workload. |
| **Overflow** | Not an issue for `n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`; but if extended, use `long long`. |
| **Hard‚Äëcoded limits** | Keep the algorithm generic so it scales to larger `n`. |

---

## üò± The Ugly

| Issue | What to avoid |
|-------|---------------|
| **Recursive implementation** | Can cause stack overflows if recursion depth grows. |
| **Repeated factorisation** | Caching the factor sums for seen numbers would be overkill here but may help for larger inputs. |
| **Inefficient I/O** | For interview practice, console I/O is fine; but in production use buffered streams. |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Walkthrough

Below are the three implementations you can copy‚Äëpaste into your IDE.

### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public int smallestValue(int n) {
        while (true) {
            int sum = primeFactorSum(n);
            if (sum == n) return n;  // prime found
            n = sum;
        }
    }
    private int primeFactorSum(int x) { ‚Ä¶ }  // see code above
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestValue(self, n: int) -> int:
        while True:
            s = self._prime_factor_sum(n)
            if s == n: return n
            n = s
    def _prime_factor_sum(self, x: int) -> int: ‚Ä¶  # see code above
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestValue(int n) {
        while (true) {
            int sum = primeFactorSum(n);
            if (sum == n) return n;
            n = sum;
        }
    }
private:
    int primeFactorSum(int x) { ‚Ä¶ }  // see code above
};
```

All three share the same helper `primeFactorSum`, which runs in `O(‚àöx)`.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis

- **Time**: `O(‚àön * k)` where `k` is the number of iterations (‚â§ 6 for `n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`).  
- **Space**: `O(1)` ‚Äì only a few local variables.

---

## üé§ Interview‚ÄëReady Tips

1. **Explain the convergence**: Talk about why the sequence hits a prime and stays there.  
2. **Mention optimisation**: ‚ÄúWe skip even numbers after handling factor 2.‚Äù  
3. **Show off readability**: Keep helper methods small and well‚Äënamed.  
4. **Prepare for extensions**: If the constraints change (`n ‚â§ 10¬π¬≤`), use `long long` and consider a simple sieve for the first few prime checks.
