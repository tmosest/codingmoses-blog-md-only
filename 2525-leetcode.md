                         height >= 10_000 || volume >= 1_000_000_000L;
        boolean heavy  = mass >= 100;

        if (bulky && heavy)      return "Both";
        if (bulky)               return "Bulky";
        if (heavy)               return "Heavy";

    bulky = (length >= 10_000 or
             width  >= 10_000 or
             height >= 10_000 or

> **Keywords**: LeetCode, Categorize Box, Java solution, Python solution, C++ solution, job interview, algorithm, time complexity, coding interview, software engineer, data structures, programming interview

### üìå Introduction

Landing a software engineering role often feels like a marathon‚Äîendless coding challenges, algorithmic puzzles, and the dreaded ‚ÄúLeetCode‚Äù name. Among the myriad of problems, ‚Äú2525. Categorize Box According to Criteria‚Äù stands out for its deceptively simple logic but subtle edge cases. Whether you‚Äôre polishing your interview prep or aiming to impress recruiters, mastering this problem is a must‚Äëdo.

> **Why This Problem?**  
> It blends arithmetic, logical conditions, and overflow awareness‚Äîcommon pitfalls in real‚Äëworld code. Solving it showcases your ability to write clean, efficient, and bug‚Äëfree code.

### üìù Problem Statement (Simplified)

You‚Äôre given a box‚Äôs dimensions (length, width, height) and its mass. Classify the box into one of five categories:

| Category | Conditions |
|----------|------------|
| **Bulky** | Any dimension ‚â•‚ÄØ10,000 OR volume ‚â•‚ÄØ10‚Åπ |
| **Heavy** | Mass ‚â•‚ÄØ100 |
| **Both** | Bulky **and** Heavy |
| **Bulky** | Only Bulky |
| **Heavy** | Only Heavy |
| **Neither** | Neither Bulky nor Heavy |

**Constraints**  
- 1‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØlength, width, height‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ10‚Åµ  
- 1‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØmass‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ10¬≥  

---

### üîé Approach (The Good)

1. **Compute Volume Safely**  
   - Use a 64‚Äëbit integer (`long` in Java, `long long` in C++, built‚Äëin Python int) to avoid overflow when multiplying up to 10‚Åµ √ó 10‚Åµ √ó 10‚Åµ = 10¬π‚Åµ.
2. **Boolean Flags**  
   - `bulky` and `heavy` are simple `bool`/`boolean` expressions.  
   - Clear separation makes the final `if` ladder readable.
3. **Order of Checks**  
   - `Both` first, then `Bulky`, then `Heavy`, and finally `Neither`.  
   - No redundant checks, O(1) time, O(1) space.

### üö´ Pitfalls (The Bad)

| Pitfall | Why It Happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Integer overflow** | In languages like Java and C++, 32‚Äëbit multiplication overflows before comparison. | Promote to 64‚Äëbit (`long`, `long long`, or Python‚Äôs arbitrary‚Äëprecision int). |
| **Mis‚Äëordered conditions** | Checking ‚ÄúHeavy‚Äù before ‚ÄúBulky‚Äù may incorrectly return ‚ÄúHeavy‚Äù for a ‚ÄúBoth‚Äù box. | Prioritize the most specific condition first (i.e., ‚ÄúBoth‚Äù). |
| **Boundary errors** | Forgetting to include the ‚Äúgreater **or** equal‚Äù part of the constraints. | Always use `>=` instead of `>` for dimensions, volume, and mass. |
| **Performance myths** | Over‚Äëengineering with loops or extra functions. | Keep it simple: a handful of boolean checks is enough. |

---

### üí° Alternative Solutions (The Ugly)

Some coders attempt to encode the logic in a single line or use bitmasks. While clever, they sacrifice readability:

```python
return ["Neither","Bulky","Heavy","Both"][bool(bulky)*2+bool(heavy)]
```

- **Pros**: Ultra‚Äëshort code.  
- **Cons**: Hard to maintain, error‚Äëprone, and defeats the purpose of a clean interview answer.

---

### üìà Complexity Analysis

- **Time**: `O(1)` ‚Äì a constant number of arithmetic and comparison operations.  
- **Space**: `O(1)` ‚Äì only a few primitive variables and boolean flags.

---

### üìö Step‚Äëby‚ÄëStep Implementation (Java)

```java
public String categorizeBox(int length, int width, int height, int mass) {
    long volume = 1L * length * width * height;   // 64‚Äëbit
    boolean bulky = (length >= 10000 || width >= 10000 || height >= 10000
                     || volume >= 1_000_000_000L);
    boolean heavy = mass >= 100;

    if (bulky && heavy) return "Both";
    if (bulky)          return "Bulky";
    if (heavy)          return "Heavy";
    return "Neither";
}
```

*Same logic applies to Python and C++ ‚Äì only syntax changes.*

### üèÅ Takeaways for Your Interview

1. **Read the constraints carefully** ‚Äì they hint at potential overflow.  
2. **Prefer clarity over cleverness** ‚Äì interviewers value readable, maintainable code.  
3. **Think in terms of flags** ‚Äì they translate directly to conditional branches.  
4. **Test boundary values** ‚Äì e.g., length = 10,000, volume = 1,000,000,000, mass = 100.  
5. **Mention complexity** ‚Äì always state `O(1)` for both time and space when asked.
