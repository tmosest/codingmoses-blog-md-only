        ## 1.  LeetCode 2530 – “Maximal Score After Applying K Operations”

> **Problem**  
> You are given an array `nums` of positive integers and an integer `k`.  
> Initially your score is `0`. In one operation you choose an index `i`,
> add `nums[i]` to your score, and replace `nums[i]` with `ceil(nums[i] / 3)`.  
> Perform **exactly** `k` operations and return the maximum score you can achieve.

> **Constraints**  
> * `1 ≤ nums.length, k ≤ 10⁵`  
> * `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁹`

## 2.  Solution Overview

The operation always gives you the *current* value of an element, and after that
the element is reduced to roughly one‑third of its former size.  
To maximise the total score you should always pick the **largest** remaining
number.

### Greedy + Max‑Heap

1. **Build a max‑heap** (priority queue) containing all elements of `nums`.
2. Repeat `k` times:
   * Extract the largest element `x` (O(log n)).
   * Add `x` to the score (`long` to avoid overflow).
   * Compute `ceil(x / 3)` and push it back into the heap.

Because each operation is independent, picking the largest element at every
step is optimal – no future operation can benefit from a smaller current value.

### Complexity

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Building heap | `O(n)` | `O(n)` |
| Each operation | `O(log n)` | – |
| Total for `k` ops | `O(n + k log n)` | `O(n)` |

With `n, k ≤ 10⁵` this easily fits within the limits.

## 3.  Full Code Implementations

Below are clean, ready‑to‑copy solutions in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.
All use a max‑heap and a 64‑bit accumulator for the score.

### 3.1  Java

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class Solution {
    public long maxKelements(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Max‑heap: largest element at the head
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        for (int num : nums) {
            maxHeap.offer(num);
        }

        long score = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int x = maxHeap.poll();      // largest value
            score += x;
            int reduced = (int) Math.ceil(x / 3.0);
            maxHeap.offer(reduced);
        }
        return score;
    }
}
```

### 3.2  Python

```python
import heapq
from math import ceil
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxKelements(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Python has a min‑heap, so store negatives to simulate a max‑heap
        max_heap = [-x for x in nums]
        heapq.heapify(max_heap)

        score = 0
        for _ in range(k):
            x = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)   # largest element
            score += x
            reduced = ceil(x / 3)
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -reduced)
        return score
```

### 3.3  C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long maxKelements(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // Max‑heap using priority_queue
        priority_queue<long long> pq;
        for (int num : nums) pq.push(num);

        long long score = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            long long x = pq.top(); pq.pop();
            score += x;
            long long reduced = (x + 2) / 3; // ceil(x/3) for positive integers
            pq.push(reduced);
        }
        return score;
    }
};
```

## 4.  Blog‑Style Deep Dive

> **Title**: *Mastering LeetCode 2530 – “Maximal Score After Applying K Operations” with a Heap‑Based Greedy Approach*  
> **Meta Description**: Learn the greedy + max‑heap solution for LeetCode 2530. Step‑by‑step Java, Python, and C++ implementations. Boost your interview score!

### 4.1  Introduction

When preparing for coding interviews, problems that combine greedy choices with a data structure like a heap keep popping up.  
LeetCode **2530 – Maximal Score After Applying K Operations** is a perfect example.  
It asks you to repeatedly pick the largest element from an array, add it to a running total, and then reduce it.  

In this article we’ll walk through the intuition, pitfalls, and best‑practice implementations.

### 4.2  Problem Re‑statement

> *Given an array `nums` of size `n` and an integer `k`, perform exactly `k` operations.  
> In each operation:  
> 1. Pick index `i` (any).  
> 2. Add `nums[i]` to your score.  
> 3. Replace `nums[i]` with `ceil(nums[i]/3)`.  
> Return the maximum achievable score.*

### 4.3  Intuition – Why Greedy Works

The operation is **deterministic**: once you pick a value, it contributes immediately to the score and then shrinks.  
Suppose at some step you choose a sub‑optimal element `y < x` while a larger element `x` is available.  
Because future reductions depend only on the *current* value, picking `y` now cannot ever give you a larger total than picking `x`.  
Thus the greedy rule “always pick the largest element” is optimal.

### 4.4  Data Structure Choice

The naive approach of scanning the array for the maximum in each of the `k` steps would be `O(k·n)`.  
Instead we maintain a **max‑heap** (priority queue) that gives `O(log n)` extraction and insertion.

- **Java**: `PriorityQueue<Integer>` with a custom comparator `(a, b) -> b - a`.
- **Python**: `heapq` is a min‑heap; store negatives to invert the order.
- **C++**: `priority_queue<long long>` is a max‑heap by default.

### 4.5  Step‑by‑Step Pseudocode

```
build max-heap from nums
score = 0
repeat k times:
    x = pop-max()
    score += x
    y = ceil(x / 3)
    push y into heap
return score
```

### 4.6  Edge Cases & Overflow

- Use `long`/`long long` for the running score (`nums[i]` can be up to `10^9` and `k` up to `10^5` → score up to `10^14`).
- Ceil division for positive integers can be done as `(x + 2) / 3` (integer arithmetic).

### 4.7  Good, Bad, Ugly

| Category | What’s Good | What’s Bad | What’s Ugly |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Good** | • Simple greedy rule<br>• Heap guarantees `O(log n)` ops<br>• Handles large inputs |
| **Bad** | • Requires a heap (extra memory)<br>• Ceil calculation may be confusing for newcomers |
| **Ugly** | • If you forget to use a max‑heap you’ll get wrong answers<br>• Off‑by‑one in ceil formula can lead to subtle bugs |

### 4.8  Alternative Approaches (When the Heap Isn’t Enough)

- **Multiset / TreeMap** (C++ / Java): similar to a heap but allows custom ordering.  
- **Bucket Sort for Small Range**: If `nums` values are bounded, maintain counts per value and traverse from high to low.  
- **Dynamic Programming**: Not applicable here due to huge state space.

However, the heap approach remains the most straightforward and efficient.

### 4.9  Final Thoughts

*LeetCode 2530* is a classic exercise that tests your ability to translate a greedy strategy into an efficient implementation using heaps.  
The key takeaway:

> **Always pick the largest available value, update it, and repeat.**

With the Java, Python, and C++ snippets above, you can confidently tackle this problem in any interview setting.

## 5.  Closing

Feel free to copy the code snippets into your local editor, run them against LeetCode’s test cases, and tweak as needed.  
If you’re preparing for technical interviews, try extending this problem:

- What if the reduction factor changes (e.g., divide by 4)?
- What if you can skip operations?

Understanding the heap‑based greedy pattern will serve you well on many other problems.
