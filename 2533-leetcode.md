## üöÄ High‚ÄëLevel Idea

The constraints (maxLength‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ10‚Åµ) forbid enumerating all strings.  
Instead, observe that a good string can be built **incrementally**:

* Starting from an empty string (length‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0, which satisfies the ‚Äúmultiple‚Äù rule).  
* Each step appends either  
  * `oneGroup` consecutive `1`s, **or**  
  * `zeroGroup` consecutive `0`s.

So if we know how many good strings of length `i` exist (`dp[i]`), we can get the counts for longer lengths by adding the two possible block sizes.

This is a classic *bottom‚Äëup* dynamic programming recurrence.

```
dp[0] = 1  // empty string
for i = 1 ‚Ä¶ maxLength
    if i ‚â• oneGroup: dp[i] += dp[i - oneGroup]
    if i ‚â• zeroGroup: dp[i] += dp[i - zeroGroup]
    dp[i] %= MOD
```

The answer is the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` in `[minLength,‚ÄØmaxLength]`.

The recurrence runs in **O(maxLength)** time and needs **O(maxLength)** memory ‚Äì easily fast enough for 10‚Åµ.

## üí°  Code Walk‚ÄëThrough (Java)

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

    public int goodBinaryStrings(int minLength, int maxLength,
                                 int oneGroup, int zeroGroup) {

        // dp[i] = number of good strings of length i
        int[] dp = new int[maxLength + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;                          // empty string

        long result = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= maxLength; i++) {
            if (i >= oneGroup) {
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - oneGroup]) % MOD;
            }
            if (i >= zeroGroup) {
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - zeroGroup]) % MOD;
            }
            if (i >= minLength) {
                result = (result + dp[i]) % MOD;
            }
        }

        return (int) result;
    }
}
```

**Key points**

| ‚úÖ | Explanation |
|---|-------------|
| `dp[0] = 1` | Empty string counts as a valid prefix (zero is a multiple of everything). |
| `if (i >= oneGroup)` | Only extend when we have enough room for a new block. |
| `result += dp[i]` | Only sum when the length meets the minimum requirement. |

## üí°  Code Walk‚ÄëThrough (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    MOD = 1_000_000_007

    def goodBinaryStrings(self, minLength: int, maxLength: int,
                          oneGroup: int, zeroGroup: int) -> int:

        dp = [0] * (maxLength + 1)
        dp[0] = 1                          # empty string
        result = 0

        for i in range(1, maxLength + 1):
            if i >= oneGroup:
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - oneGroup]) % self.MOD
            if i >= zeroGroup:
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - zeroGroup]) % self.MOD
            if i >= minLength:
                result = (result + dp[i]) % self.MOD

        return result
```

Same logic, just Pythonic syntax.

## üí°  Code Walk‚ÄëThrough (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    static const int MOD = 1'000'000'007;
    
    int goodBinaryStrings(int minLength, int maxLength,
                          int oneGroup, int zeroGroup) {
        vector<int> dp(maxLength + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;                         // empty string
        long long res = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= maxLength; ++i) {
            if (i >= oneGroup)
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - oneGroup]) % MOD;
            if (i >= zeroGroup)
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - zeroGroup]) % MOD;
            if (i >= minLength)
                res = (res + dp[i]) % MOD;
        }
        return static_cast<int>(res);
    }
};
```

## üìà Complexity Analysis

| | Java | Python | C++ |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Time** | `O(maxLength)` | `O(maxLength)` | `O(maxLength)` |
| **Space** | `O(maxLength)` | `O(maxLength)` | `O(maxLength)` |

Both time and space are linear in the maximum string length ‚Äì perfectly fine for 10‚Åµ.

## üéØ  ‚ÄúGood, the Bad, and the Ugly‚Äù

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Design** | Clear recurrence; bottom‚Äëup DP | ‚úÖ | |
| **Edge Cases** | Handles zero length as multiple; minLength=1 | ‚úÖ | |
| **Readability** | Simple loops, comments | ‚úÖ | |
| **Scalability** | Linear time/space | ‚úÖ | |
| **Potential Pitfalls** | Forgetting modulo after each addition | ‚ö†Ô∏è | |
| **Memory Usage** | Only `maxLength+1` integers | ‚ö†Ô∏è | |
| **Alternate Approach** | Top‚Äëdown memoization (recursive) | ‚ö†Ô∏è | May hit recursion depth on large input |
| **Optimization** | None needed | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Bottom‚Äëup is best |

**Why Bottom‚ÄëUp is the winner**  
- Avoids recursion stack limits.  
- Single pass over the length range.  
- No need for extra data structures beyond the `dp` array.

### Introduction

When I first saw **LeetCode 2533 ‚Äì Number of Good Binary Strings**, I thought it was just another ‚Äúcount strings‚Äù problem. The twist? The string blocks must be *multiples* of given group sizes.  
In an interview, the interviewer usually wants you to show two things:

1. You understand the constraints and can pick an efficient algorithm.  
2. You can translate that algorithm into clean, idiomatic code in your chosen language.

Below, I walk through the DP solution that runs in **O(n)** time, give you ready‚Äëto‚Äëpaste Java, Python, and C++ snippets, and explain why this approach is perfect for a coding interview.

---

### Problem Restatement

A *good* binary string satisfies:

- Length ‚àà `[minLength, maxLength]`.
- Every consecutive run of `1`s has a length that is a multiple of `oneGroup`.
- Every consecutive run of `0`s has a length that is a multiple of `zeroGroup`.

Return the number of good strings modulo `10‚Åπ+7`.

Constraints make a naive enumeration impossible (`2^maxLength` strings). We need a *linear* solution.

---

### The Core Insight

A good string can be **grown** from an empty string by repeatedly adding a block of length `oneGroup` or `zeroGroup`.  
If we denote:

```
dp[i] = number of good strings of exact length i
```

then for any `i`:

```
dp[i] = (dp[i - oneGroup]  if i ‚â• oneGroup) +
        (dp[i - zeroGroup] if i ‚â• zeroGroup)
```

Because the empty string (length‚ÄØ0) satisfies the multiple condition, we start with `dp[0] = 1`.  
The final answer is the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` in `[minLength, maxLength]`.

---

### Step‚Äëby‚ÄëStep Implementation

1. **Initialize** `dp[0] = 1`.  
2. **Iterate** `i` from `1` to `maxLength`.  
3. **Update** `dp[i]` using the recurrence (careful with `i - block` only if it is non‚Äënegative).  
4. **Modulo** the result after each addition to avoid overflow.  
5. **Accumulate** into the answer when `i ‚â• minLength`.

This is what all three language solutions look like ‚Äì just syntax differences.

> **Tip for the Interviewer**  
> ‚ÄúDid you remember to apply the modulo after each addition?‚Äù ‚Äì The interviewer will test you on integer overflow.

---

### Complexity Discussion

- **Time**: We touch each index once ‚Äì `O(maxLength)`.  
- **Space**: One array of size `maxLength+1` ‚Äì `O(maxLength)`.  

With `maxLength ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`, this runs in milliseconds on modern machines.

### Interview‚ÄëReady Variations

| Variation | When to Use | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bottom‚ÄëUp DP (the one above)** | Most interviews | Simple, no recursion, fast | None |
| **Top‚ÄëDown Memoization** | If you prefer recursion | Easier to write initially | Recursion depth can hit Python‚Äôs limit; slightly slower due to function calls |
| **Recursive + Memo** | For small constraints | Elegant functional style | Same depth risk |

---

### Why This Solution Rocks

| ‚úîÔ∏è | Explanation |
|---|-------------|
| *Linear time* | Handles 10‚Åµ in <‚ÄØ1‚ÄØs. |
| *Single array* | Minimal memory overhead. |
| *Modular arithmetic* | Avoids 64‚Äëbit overflow. |
| *Clear logic* | One loop, two conditionals ‚Äì perfect for a clean interview answer. |

---

### Wrap‚ÄëUp

- **LeetCode 2533** is a great interview problem for testing *state compression* and *block‚Äëbased DP*.  
- The recurrence is **directly derived** from the problem‚Äôs ‚Äúgrow the string‚Äù description.  
- The provided Java, Python, and C++ code is production‚Äëready: fully commented, uses constants, and respects the modulo constraint.  

If you‚Äôre prepping for a *software engineer* interview, this solution demonstrates:

- Deep understanding of constraints.  
- Ability to design a DP recurrence.  
- Fluency in three of the most popular interview languages.

Good luck, and happy coding! üöÄ
