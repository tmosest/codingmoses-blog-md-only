        ## 1.  The Code (Java / Python / C++)

Below are *clean, production‑ready* implementations that solve LeetCode 2546 –  
“Apply Bitwise Operations to Make Strings Equal”.  
All three versions share the same O(n) logic, only the syntax differs.

| Language | Code |
|----------|------|
| **Java** | `public class Solution { public boolean makeStringsEqual(String s, String target) { return s.contains(\"1\") == target.contains(\"1\"); } }` |
| **Python** | `class Solution: def makeStringsEqual(self, s: str, target: str) -> bool: return ('1' in s) == ('1' in target)` |
| **C++** | `class Solution { public: bool makeStringsEqual(string s, string target) { return (s.find('1') != string::npos) == (target.find('1') != string::npos); } };` |

### Quick Test Harness (Optional)

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution sol = new Solution();
    System.out.println(sol.makeStringsEqual("1010", "0110")); // true
    System.out.println(sol.makeStringsEqual("11",    "00")); // false
}
```

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    print(sol.makeStringsEqual("1010", "0110"))  # True
    print(sol.makeStringsEqual("11",    "00"))   # False
```

```cpp
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    cout << boolalpha;
    cout << sol.makeStringsEqual("1010", "0110") << endl; // true
    cout << sol.makeStringsEqual("11",    "00")   << endl; // false
}
```

All three harnesses print the expected output.

### Introduction

> **Problem 2546 – Apply Bitwise Operations to Make Strings Equal**  
> You're given two binary strings `s` and `target` of equal length.  
> In one operation you can pick two distinct indices `i` and `j` and simultaneously change  
> `s[i] = s[i] OR s[j]` and `s[j] = s[i] XOR s[j]`.  
> The goal is to decide whether you can transform `s` into `target`.

At first glance the operation looks complicated. A naïve DP or BFS would explode in time and memory. The key to cracking this problem is **observing how the operation behaves on 0/1 pairs**.  

---

### 2.1 Intuition – “What the Operation Can Do”

Consider the four possible bit‑pairs and the result of one operation:

| `s[i]` | `s[j]` | New `s[i]` | New `s[j]` | Observation |
|--------|--------|------------|------------|-------------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Nothing changes |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | A lone 1 can turn a 0 into 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Symmetric to above |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | Two 1s can turn one of them back into 0 |

From the table we can distill three facts:

1. **All zeros stay zeros forever** – the operation never creates a `1` out of two zeros.  
2. **If at least one `1` exists, any `0` can be turned into a `1`** – pick the `1` as `i` and the `0` as `j`.  
3. **If at least two `1`s exist, any `1` can be turned into a `0`** – pick the two `1`s as `i` and `j`.

These observations mean that any string that contains at least one `1` can reach **every** other string that also contains at least one `1`. The only impossible case is when you try to change an all‑zero string into a string that contains a `1`.

### 2.2 The “Good” – The One‑Liner

The entire problem collapses to a single condition:

> **If `s` has a `1` iff `target` has a `1`, return `true`; otherwise `false`.**

That’s why every high‑score solution on LeetCode boils down to a single line that checks the presence of `'1'`.

**Java**

```java
return s.contains("1") == target.contains("1");
```

**Python**

```python
return ('1' in s) == ('1' in target)
```

**C++**

```cpp
return (s.find('1') != string::npos) == (target.find('1') != string::npos);
```

The solution runs in **O(n)** time (scanning each string once) and **O(1)** space.

### 2.3 The “Bad” – Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why it fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Assuming you need to count zeros/ones** | Counting adds unnecessary complexity and may hide the simple logic | Just test for the presence of `'1'` |
| **Thinking two 1s are enough to make any string** | You can only make a 1 → 0 if you have *at least* two 1s in the current string, not just in the target | Use the rule that two 1s are needed to flip one back to 0 |
| **Using recursion or BFS** | Exponential state space (up to 2ⁿ) | Recognize the invariant and reduce to the “all‑zero” vs. “has‑1” dichotomy |

---

### 2.4 The “Ugly” – Over‑engineering

Many attempts over‑engineer the solution with:

- **Bitmask DP**: Trying to treat the string as a binary number.  
- **Graph Search**: Building a graph where nodes are strings and edges are valid operations.  
- **Greedy Simulations**: Repeatedly choosing indices without proof that it converges.

These approaches are **ugly** because they:

1. Break the O(n) time constraint (often become O(2ⁿ)).  
2. Hide the simple invariant.  
3. Make the solution hard to understand and maintain.

### 2.5 Testing – Edge Cases to Cover

| Test | Input | Expected |
|------|-------|----------|
| All zeros | s = `"0000"`, target = `"0000"` | `true` |
| All zeros to ones | s = `"0000"`, target = `"1000"` | `false` |
| One 1 to all zeros | s = `"1000"`, target = `"0000"` | `true` |
| Two 1s to one 0 | s = `"1100"`, target = `"0100"` | `true` |
| Large random strings | n = 10⁵ | O(n) performance |

---

### 2.6 Summary

- The operation’s effect reduces to a simple invariant: **presence of at least one `1`**.  
- The entire problem is solved with a **one‑liner** in any language.  
- Complexity: **O(n)** time, **O(1)** space.  
- No need for DP, BFS, or complicated bit tricks.  

**Takeaway for the job interview**: Always look for an invariant or a hidden “collapse” in the problem statement. It often turns a seemingly hard challenge into a trivial one.

### 2.7 Final Thoughts

- **Write the solution, run it** – the test harness above shows that the one‑liner works for all examples.  
- **Explain the intuition** – interviewers love concise reasoning.  
- **Keep the code minimal** – the beauty of LeetCode lies in elegant simplicity.
