### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Recap

> **House Robber‚ÄØIV**  
>  *Medium ‚Äì 2560*  
> 
> We have `n` houses on a street.  
> `nums[i]` is the amount of money in house `i`.  
> A robber can never rob two adjacent houses.  
> The *capability* of the robber is the **maximum** amount taken from a single house among all the houses he robbed.  
>  
> **Goal**: Rob **at least `k` houses** (there‚Äôs always a feasible way) and return the **minimum possible capability**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Core Idea ‚Äì Binary Search on the Answer

*Why binary search?*  
The answer is a value between `1` and `max(nums)`.  
If we can check whether a particular `mid` (the candidate capability) is feasible, we can decide which half of the search space to keep.

#### Feasibility Test (`canRob`)

- We scan the array from left to right.
- When we encounter a house with `nums[i] ‚â§ mid`, we *rob* it and skip the next house (because adjacent houses are forbidden).
- Count how many houses we robbed.
- If the count is at least `k`, `mid` is **good**; otherwise it‚Äôs **bad**.

This greedy scan guarantees the *maximum* number of houses we can rob with capability `mid`.  
If even that maximum is `< k`, no arrangement with capability `mid` can satisfy the requirement.

#### Complexity

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Feasibility check | `O(n)` | `O(1)` |
| Binary search over `[1, max(nums)]` | `O(log(max(nums)))` iterations | `O(1)` |

Total: `O(n log(max(nums)))` time, `O(1)` auxiliary space.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Code

Below are three complete, idiomatic solutions ‚Äì **Java**, **Python**, and **C++** ‚Äì ready to paste into LeetCode‚Äôs online editor.

> **Tip** ‚Äì The LeetCode environment only requires the `Solution` class and the method signature.  
> Nothing else (no `main` function) is needed.

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Java

```java
class Solution {
    // Feasibility check: can we rob at least k houses with capability <= mid?
    private boolean canRob(int[] nums, int mid, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ) {
            if (nums[i] <= mid) {
                count++;          // rob this house
                i += 2;           // skip the adjacent house
            } else {
                i++;              // skip this house only
            }
        }
        return count >= k;
    }

    public int minCapability(int[] nums, int k) {
        int left = 1, right = 0;
        for (int v : nums) right = Math.max(right, v);   // max(nums)

        int ans = right;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canRob(nums, mid, k)) {
                ans = mid;
                right = mid - 1;   // try to lower the capability
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;    // need a larger capability
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

#### üêç Python

```python
class Solution:
    def can_rob(self, nums: list[int], limit: int, k: int) -> bool:
        """Return True if we can rob at least k houses with max amount <= limit."""
        cnt = 0
        i = 0
        n = len(nums)
        while i < n:
            if nums[i] <= limit:
                cnt += 1
                i += 2          # skip the next house
            else:
                i += 1
        return cnt >= k

    def minCapability(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        lo, hi = 1, max(nums)
        ans = hi
        while lo <= hi:
            mid = (lo + hi) // 2
            if self.can_rob(nums, mid, k):
                ans = mid
                hi = mid - 1
            else:
                lo = mid + 1
        return ans
```

#### üóúÔ∏è C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Greedy feasibility test
    bool canRob(const vector<int>& nums, int limit, int k) {
        int cnt = 0, i = 0, n = nums.size();
        while (i < n) {
            if (nums[i] <= limit) {
                ++cnt;
                i += 2;           // skip adjacent house
            } else {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        return cnt >= k;
    }

    int minCapability(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int lo = 1, hi = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end()), ans = hi;
        while (lo <= hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if (canRob(nums, mid, k)) {
                ans = mid;
                hi = mid - 1;
            } else {
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúThe Good‚Äù ‚Äì Why This Works

| ‚úîÔ∏è | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Optimal** | Binary search guarantees the minimal capability. |
| **Linear Scan** | Feasibility check is just a single pass (`O(n)`). |
| **No DP Needed** | Unlike classic House Robber, we don‚Äôt need to keep track of two states; a greedy count suffices. |
| **Scalable** | Works comfortably for `n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ` and `nums[i] ‚â§ 10‚Åπ`. |
| **Clear Code** | No hidden magic ‚Äì simple loops, straightforward conditions. |

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúThe Bad‚Äù ‚Äì Common Pitfalls

| ‚ö†Ô∏è | Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Binary search bounds off by one | Using `while (left < right)` and returning `left` may miss the exact answer if the last comparison is wrong. | Use `while (left <= right)` and keep an explicit `ans` variable. |
| Skipping adjacency incorrectly | Incrementing index by `2` **only** when robbing; otherwise increment by `1`. | Ensure the `else` clause doesn‚Äôt skip houses unnecessarily. |
| Using `int` for large sums | Not an issue here because we never sum values ‚Äì but be wary if you change the problem. | Stick to `int` for capability values; they fit within 32‚Äëbit. |
| Overflow in `mid` calculation | `mid = (left + right) / 2` can overflow if using `int`. | Use `mid = left + (right - left) / 2`. |
| Wrong return type on LeetCode | Returning `long` where `int` is expected can cause a type mismatch. | Return the same type as the signature (`int`). |

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúThe Ugly‚Äù ‚Äì Edge Cases & Extra Considerations

1. **All houses have the same value**  
   *E.g.*, `nums = [5, 5, 5, 5]`, `k = 2`.  
   The answer is simply that value (5). Binary search still works but is overkill.

2. **Very large `k`**  
   `k` may equal `(n+1)/2` (the maximum number of non‚Äëadjacent houses).  
   The greedy counter will pick every other house ‚Äì still `O(n)`.

3. **Array of size 1**  
   If `k = 1`, the answer is `nums[0]`.  
   Our algorithm naturally handles this.

4. **Memory constraints**  
   The solution uses `O(1)` additional memory ‚Äì perfect for interview scenarios where ‚Äúconstant space‚Äù is highlighted.

5. **Time limit in a language like Python**  
   Although `O(n log(max(nums)))` is fine for `n = 10‚Åµ`, Python‚Äôs slower loops might push the time limit close to 2 seconds on LeetCode.  
   *Optimization*: Convert the input list to a `list[int]` (already the case) and avoid repeated function calls by inline logic if needed.

#### Problem Recap

(Include the full problem statement with examples as above)

#### Intuition & Strategy

(Explain the binary search on the maximum capability, the greedy feasibility check, and why it works. Use diagrams if possible.)

---

#### Pseudocode

```
canRob(nums, limit, k):
    count = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if nums[i] <= limit:
            count += 1
            i += 2        // skip next house
        else:
            i += 1
    return count >= k

minCapability(nums, k):
    lo = 1
    hi = max(nums)
    ans = hi
    while lo <= hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2
        if canRob(nums, mid, k):
            ans = mid
            hi = mid - 1
        else:
            lo = mid + 1
    return ans
```

#### Full Implementations

(Insert the Java, Python, and C++ code blocks above.)

---

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time**: `O(n log(max(nums)))`  
- **Space**: `O(1)` auxiliary

Explain the log factor comes from binary searching the answer, not the array.

---

#### Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

(Use the ‚ÄúBad‚Äù table; emphasize off‚Äëby‚Äëone errors, incorrect adjacency handling.)

---

#### Edge Cases

(Summarize the ‚ÄúUgly‚Äù table; provide quick sanity checks for minimal array sizes.)

---

#### Interview Tips

- **Explain your thought process**: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm binary searching the maximum possible robbery amount because the answer is monotonic.‚Äù  
- **Talk about the greedy counter**: why we can simply count houses rather than building DP states.  
- **Mention the difference** from the classic House Robber (DP with two states).  

---

#### Conclusion

(Encourage readers to practice variations: e.g., different adjacency rules, or adding a constraint on the total number of robbed houses.)
