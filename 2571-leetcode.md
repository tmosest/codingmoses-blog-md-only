        ## 1. Solution Code

Below are three clean, **O(log n)** implementations (Java, Python, C++) that solve the LeetCode problem *2571 – Minimum Operations to Reduce an Integer to 0*.  
All three use the same greedy‑bit‑manipulation idea:  
*When the least‑significant two bits are `11` we add 1 (making the block `00` and carrying 1), otherwise we simply remove a single `1` or shift.*  
This gives the optimal sequence of operations.

### Java (Java 17)

```java
/**
 * 2571. Minimum Operations to Reduce an Integer to 0
 * O(log n) time, O(1) space
 */
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int n) {
        int ops = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            // if the two least‑significant bits are 11 (binary 3)
            if ((n & 3) == 3) {
                n++;          // add 2^0 to clear the trailing 1s
                ops++;
            } else {
                ops += n & 1; // add 1 if the lowest bit is 1
                n >>= 1;      // shift right (divide by 2)
            }
        }
        return ops;
    }
}
```

### Python (3.10+)

```python
"""
2571. Minimum Operations to Reduce an Integer to 0

"""

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
        ops = 0
        while n:
            # if the last two bits are 11
            if n & 3 == 3:
                n += 1          # add 1 to carry
                ops += 1
            else:
                ops += n & 1    # count a lone 1
                n >>= 1         # shift right
        return ops
```

### C++ (C++17)

```cpp
/**

 */
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(int n) {
        int ops = 0;
        while (n) {
            if ((n & 3) == 3) {  // two LSBs are '11'
                ++n;            // add 1
                ++ops;
            } else {
                ops += n & 1;   // count a lone 1
                n >>= 1;        // divide by 2
            }
        }
        return ops;

### *“The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of LeetCode 2571 – How to Nail It in an Interview”*

#### Introduction  
LeetCode’s **2571 – Minimum Operations to Reduce an Integer to 0** is a deceptively simple bit‑manipulation puzzle that frequently appears in technical interviews for software engineering roles. Mastering this problem showcases your understanding of binary arithmetic, greedy reasoning, and dynamic programming. In this article, we’ll dissect the problem, walk through the most elegant solution, explore common pitfalls (“the bad”), and explain how to avoid them (“the ugly”). By the end, you’ll be ready to impress hiring managers with clean code in Java, Python, or C++.

---

#### Problem Statement (SEO keywords: *LeetCode 2571*, *minimum operations*, *integer to 0*, *bit manipulation*)

> **Given a positive integer `n`, you may add or subtract any power of 2 from it.**  
> **Return the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to 0.**  
> **Constraints**: `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`

---

#### Intuition – The “Good”  

1. **Binary view**  
   - Adding or subtracting `2^i` flips the `i`‑th bit and may cause a carry.  
   - The goal is to clear all bits with as few flips as possible.

2. **Greedy observation**  
   - When the two least‑significant bits are `01` (single `1`), we can clear it in one operation by subtracting `1`.  
   - When they are `11`, we cannot clear both with a single subtraction; the optimal move is to *add* `1` (carry) and then clear the trailing two zeros in the next iteration.  
   - This local decision leads to a globally optimal result.

3. **Time Complexity**  
   - Each iteration removes at least one bit, so the loop runs `O(log n)` times.

---

#### The Classic One‑Line Solution – The “Bad”  

A popular, albeit less readable, one‑liner exists:

```java
int minOperations(int n) {
    return Integer.bitCount(n ^ (n * 3));
}
```

**Why it works**  
- The expression `n ^ (n * 3)` turns every contiguous block of `1`s into two `1`s, so the pop‑count of the result equals the minimal operation count.

**Why it’s bad for interviews**  
- **Readability**: It hides the reasoning behind a mathematical identity.  
- **Debugging**: If the interviewers ask you to explain each step, you’ll have to break down the algebra.  
- **Language dependency**: It relies on language‑specific bit‑count functions.

---

#### The Ugly – What to Avoid  

1. **Brute‑Force Recursion**  
   - Enumerating all combinations of powers of 2 is exponential and will time‑out on `n = 10^5`.  
   - Memoization helps, but the constant factor is still high.

2. **Incorrect Greedy Edge Cases**  
   - Forgetting the `11` case (e.g., always subtracting `1`) leads to sub‑optimal counts.  
   - Example: `n = 3 (11₂)` → subtracting `1` twice gives 2 ops, but the optimal is adding `1` first (1 op) → `4 (100₂)` → subtract `4` (1 op) → total 2 ops.  
   - Missing the carry step will inflate the answer.

3. **Using Division Instead of Bit Shifts**  
   - `n / 2` is slower and less idiomatic in C++/Java.  
   - Prefer `n >>= 1` for clarity and performance.

#### Step‑by‑Step Walkthrough – The “Good” (Java)

```java
while (n > 0) {
    if ((n & 3) == 3) {   // bits: ...??11
        n++;              // add 1 → ...??00 with carry
        ops++;
    } else {
        ops += n & 1;     // clear a lone 1
        n >>= 1;          // shift right
    }
}
```

**What each branch means**  
- **`(n & 3) == 3`**: The two LSBs are `11`.  
  - Adding `1` turns `11` → `00` (after carry) and the loop will remove two bits in the next shift.  
- **Else**: Either we have `01` or `00`.  
  - If `01`, `ops += 1` clears that bit.  
  - If `00`, we just shift and do nothing.

#### Complexity Analysis – The “Good”  

| Language | Time | Space | Comment |
|----------|------|-------|---------|
| Java | `O(log n)` | `O(1)` | Uses bitwise ops and a while loop |
| Python | `O(log n)` | `O(1)` | Same greedy logic, integer arithmetic |
| C++ | `O(log n)` | `O(1)` | Direct bit‑manipulation, no library overhead |

*Memory footprint is constant because we only keep the current number and an operation counter.*

---

#### Interview‑Ready Tips  

1. **Explain the binary view first** – Start by drawing the binary representation of `n`.  
2. **State the greedy rule** – Show that you’ll look at the two LSBs; clarify the two cases (`01` vs `11`).  
3. **Write clean loops** – Avoid obscure one‑liners unless you’re certain the interviewer is comfortable with them.  
4. **Show edge‑case handling** – What if `n` is already a power of 2? Your algorithm handles it naturally.  
5. **Discuss alternatives** – Mention the DP approach and why the greedy is preferable for `n <= 10^5`.
