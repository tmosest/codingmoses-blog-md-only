        ## 🚀 2578. Split With Minimum Sum – Three‑Language Solution + SEO‑Optimized Blog

---

### TL;DR  
* **Algorithm** – Sort all digits of `num` and alternately build two numbers (`num1` and `num2`).  
* **Time** – `O(d log d)` (`d ≤ 10` – constant).  
* **Space** – `O(d)`.

| Language | Function |
|----------|----------|
| **Java** | `public int splitNum(int num)` |
| **Python** | `def splitNum(num: int) -> int:` |
| **C++** | `int splitNum(int num)` |

> **Why it’s a perfect LeetCode interview trick**  
> *Very small input, greedy, intuitive, no hidden pitfalls* – a perfect “easy” problem that shows you can turn a digit puzzle into a clean algorithm.

## 1. Problem Recap

> *Given a positive integer `num`, split it into two non‑negative integers `num1` and `num2` such that the concatenation of their digits is a permutation of `num`. Return the minimal possible sum `num1 + num2`.*

- `num` has no leading zeros.  
- `num1` and `num2` **can** have leading zeros.  
- `10 ≤ num ≤ 10⁹` → at most 10 digits.

## 2. The “Good, the Bad, the Ugly” – Why the Greedy Works

| Aspect | What we love | What can go wrong | How we avoid it |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Greedy** | By putting the smallest digits in the most significant places of both numbers, we keep each number as small as possible. | If we didn’t sort, a big digit could sit on a high place and blow up the sum. | Sort ascending – guaranteed minimal high‑place values. |
| **Alternating** | Balances the two numbers: each gets one digit per round, so neither becomes far larger. | Uneven distribution might lead to a sub‑optimal sum if one number gets a cluster of large digits. | Strict alternation ensures the “load” is shared. |
| **Edge Cases** | Handles leading zeros naturally: we build numbers from left to right, zeros simply occupy a place. | None – integer math ignores leading zeros. | No special handling required. |

> **Bottom line** – Sorting + alternating is **optimal** for any set of digits. It’s a classic “minimum sum of two numbers from digits” greedy strategy.

## 3. Code – 3 Languages

### 3.1 Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int splitNum(int num) {
        // Convert to char array, sort ascending
        char[] digits = String.valueOf(num).toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(digits);

        int num1 = 0, num2 = 0;

        // Build two numbers alternately
        for (int i = 0; i < digits.length; i++) {
            int d = digits[i] - '0';
            if ((i & 1) == 0) {        // even index → num1
                num1 = num1 * 10 + d;
            } else {                   // odd index → num2
                num2 = num2 * 10 + d;
            }
        }
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}
```

> **Why this passes LeetCode?**  
> *`num` ≤ 10⁹ → 10 digits → integer arithmetic is safe.*  
> *`Arrays.sort` is `O(d log d)`; d ≤ 10, so effectively constant.*

### 3.2 Python

```python
def splitNum(num: int) -> int:
    """
    Split the integer into two numbers with minimal sum.
    """
    digits = sorted(str(num))          # ascending order
    num1, num2 = 0, 0

    for i, ch in enumerate(digits):
        d = int(ch)
        if i % 2 == 0:
            num1 = num1 * 10 + d
        else:
            num2 = num2 * 10 + d

    return num1 + num2
```

> **Pythonic notes**  
> *`sorted` returns a list of chars; we convert each to int on the fly.*  
> *The loop builds the numbers in the same greedy way.*

---

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int splitNum(int num) {
    // Convert to string and sort
    string s = to_string(num);
    sort(s.begin(), s.end());            // ascending

    long long num1 = 0, num2 = 0;        // long long to be safe

    for (size_t i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
        int d = s[i] - '0';
        if (i % 2 == 0)
            num1 = num1 * 10 + d;
        else
            num2 = num2 * 10 + d;
    }
    return static_cast<int>(num1 + num2);
}
```

> **Why use `long long`?**  
> For safety; even if `num` had 10 digits, the sum can reach ~`2 × 10^9`, still within 32‑bit, but `long long` guarantees no overflow in the intermediate steps.

### 📌 1. Problem Overview

Split a number into two parts such that the sum is minimal. It sounds like a combinatorial explosion, but with only 10 digits it’s a textbook greedy problem.

---

### 💡 2. The Algorithmic “Good”

- **Greedy Sorting** – Place the smallest digits first.  
- **Alternating Distribution** – Ensures each number is balanced.  
- **Time** – `O(d log d)` (d ≤ 10).  
- **Space** – `O(d)`.

Why does it always work?  
If you think of the two numbers as “buckets” for the digits, putting a small digit in the highest place of a bucket keeps the bucket low. Alternating guarantees no bucket gets a cluster of large digits.

### ⚠️ 3. The “Bad” – Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Impact | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Skipping the sort | Larger digits might occupy high places, blowing up the sum | Sort ascending |
| Distributing all digits to one number | One number becomes huge, the other zero → not minimal | Alternate strictly |
| Using `int` overflow in other languages (e.g., 64‑bit vs 32‑bit) | Unexpected wrap‑around | Use 64‑bit when building numbers |

---

### 🛠️ 4. The “Ugly” – Edge Cases & Practical Tips

| Edge | Why it looks “ugly” | How we tame it |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| Leading zeros in `num1` or `num2` | They’re allowed but might look weird in debugging | Nothing special – integer math ignores them |
| Very small `num` (e.g., 10) | Only two digits → trivial | Still works – sorting gives `[0,1]` → 0 + 1 = 1 |
| Max value `1,000,000,000` (10 digits) | Largest possible sum is ~2 000 000 000 | Still within 32‑bit signed int, but use 64‑bit for safety in languages that don’t auto‑promote |

---

### 📚 5. Step‑by‑Step (Pseudo‑Code)

```
1. Convert num to a list of its digits.
2. Sort the list ascending.
3. num1 = num2 = 0
4. For each digit in sorted list:
       if index is even: num1 = num1 * 10 + digit
       else:              num2 = num2 * 10 + digit
5. Return num1 + num2
```

- **Why this matters**:  
  Interviewers love problems that hide a simple greedy solution. It shows you can **observe a pattern** and reason about minimality without brute‑forcing.
- **Talk points**:  
  *Sorting guarantees minimal high‑place digits.*  
  *Alternation keeps the two numbers balanced.*  
  *Complexity is trivial due to small input size.*
