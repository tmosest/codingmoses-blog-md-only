        # Mastering LeetCode 2578 – Split With Minimum Sum  
*A complete, interview‑ready guide (Java, Python, C++)*

> **Meta description** – Learn how to crack LeetCode 2578 “Split With Minimum Sum” with a clear greedy strategy, see clean code in Java, Python, and C++, and discover the *good, the bad, and the ugly* of this problem so you can ace your next coding interview.

## 1. Problem Recap

**LeetCode 2578 – Split With Minimum Sum**  
> *Given a positive integer `num`, split it into two non‑negative integers `num1` and `num2` such that the concatenation of `num1` and `num2` is a permutation of the digits of `num`. Return the minimal possible sum `num1 + num2`.*

*Example*  
```
num = 4325 →  num1 = 24, num2 = 35 → sum = 59   (minimum)
```

**Constraints**

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| 10 ≤ num ≤ 10⁹ | ≤ 10 digits |
| No leading zeros in `num` | – |
| `num1` and `num2` may contain leading zeros | – |

---

## 2. Naïve Ideas (Why They Fail)

| Approach | Time | Reason it’s bad |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| Enumerate all partitions of the digit multiset | O(2^d) | d ≤ 10 → 1 024 splits, still acceptable but overkill and hard to implement correctly |
| Sort digits, then try every split point | O(d log d) | Works for this problem, but you still need the greedy rule to know *where* to split |
| Greedy but put all even indices in one number, all odds in the other (without sorting) | O(d) | Wrong: digits must be sorted first; otherwise you might end up with a large sum |

---

## 3. Greedy Intuition – *The Good Part*

1. **Smaller digits should be in higher place values** – If a small digit occupies a higher place, it contributes less to the final number.
2. **Balance the two numbers** – The two numbers should have similar lengths; otherwise one becomes huge while the other stays tiny.
3. **Sorting + Alternating Assignment**  
   * Sort the digits ascending.  
   * Assign digits one by one to the two numbers:  
     * `num1` gets the 1st, 3rd, 5th… digit (even indices).  
     * `num2` gets the 2nd, 4th, 6th… digit (odd indices).

This is essentially the same strategy used for “Minimum Sum of Two Numbers” (LeetCode 1790). It guarantees the smallest possible sum because:

* Every digit goes to the *lowest possible* place value in one of the two numbers.  
* The alternation keeps both numbers as close in length as possible.

---

## 4. Algorithm Steps

```text
1. Convert num → string → char array → sort ascending.
2. Initialize num1 = 0, num2 = 0.
3. For each digit d in sorted array (index i):
       if i is even → num1 = num1 * 10 + d
       else          → num2 = num2 * 10 + d
4. Return num1 + num2.
```

*Leading zeros are automatically handled – multiplying by 10 and adding 0 keeps the number unchanged.*

---

## 5. Edge‑Case Checklist

| Edge case | Why it matters | How we handle it |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| All digits the same (e.g., 7777) | Still works – alternation gives balanced numbers | ✔ |
| Number with a zero (e.g., 1023) | Leading zero in one of the split numbers is allowed | ✔ |
| Minimal length (10) | Smallest `num` = 10 → sorted digits “01” → num1=0, num2=1 | ✔ |
| Maximal length (10 digits) | Result < 200 000 – no overflow in 32‑bit | ✔ |

---

## 6. Implementations

> **Tip:** All three solutions use `long long`/`int64_t` for safety, but the problem guarantees the result fits in 32‑bit.

### 6.1 Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int splitNum(int num) {
        // 1. Extract and sort digits
        char[] digits = String.valueOf(num).toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(digits);

        int num1 = 0, num2 = 0;

        // 2. Distribute alternately
        for (int i = 0; i < digits.length; i++) {
            int d = digits[i] - '0';
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                num1 = num1 * 10 + d;
            } else {
                num2 = num2 * 10 + d;
            }
        }

        // 3. Return the minimal sum
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}
```

**Complexity**  
*Time*: O(d log d)  (sorting) – with d ≤ 10, effectively O(1)  
*Space*: O(d)  for the digit array

---

### 6.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def splitNum(self, num: int) -> int:
        # 1. Extract digits, sort them
        digits = sorted(str(num))

        num1, num2 = 0, 0

        # 2. Alternate assignment
        for i, ch in enumerate(digits):
            d = int(ch)
            if i % 2 == 0:
                num1 = num1 * 10 + d
            else:
                num2 = num2 * 10 + d

        # 3. Minimal sum
        return num1 + num2
```

---

### 6.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long splitNum(int num) {
        string s = to_string(num);
        sort(s.begin(), s.end());

        long long num1 = 0, num2 = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); ++i) {
            int d = s[i] - '0';
            if (i % 2 == 0)
                num1 = num1 * 10 + d;
            else
                num2 = num2 * 10 + d;
        }
        return num1 + num2;
    }
};
```

## 7. Complexity Analysis

| Language | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| Java | O(d log d) | O(d) |
| Python | O(d log d) | O(d) |
| C++ | O(d log d) | O(d) |

With **d ≤ 10** (max 10 digits), all implementations run in negligible time (< 1 ms).

## 8. Good, Bad, and Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Intuition** | Greedy sorting + alternation is *simple*, *deterministic*, and *optimal* | Requires understanding why sorting is needed – naïve solutions often overlook it | Over‑optimizing by trying bit‑mask enumeration is unnecessary and obfuscates the logic |
| **Implementation** | Compact code, handles leading zeros automatically | Forgetting to convert chars to int (e.g., `ch - '0'`) causes bugs | Using `int` when building numbers can overflow if the input limit were higher – defensive coding with `long long` is safer |
| **Testing** | Small number of test cases (10–20) cover all edge cases | Over‑relying on `assert` statements can hide bugs if not exhaustive | Hard‑to‑trace bugs from integer division or string manipulation mistakes |

---

## 9. Common Pitfalls & Fixes

| Mistake | What you might see | Fix |
|---------|-------------------|-----|
| **Not sorting digits** | The algorithm may produce a larger sum (e.g., `num=4325` → `num1=35, num2=24 → 59` *works* but wrong order can give 75) | Always `Arrays.sort` (Java), `sorted(str(num))` (Python), or `sort(s.begin(), s.end())` (C++) |
| **Mixing up index parity** | Assigning digits incorrectly leads to unbalanced numbers | Use `i % 2 == 0` consistently |
| **Using string concatenation for large numbers** | `int` overflow if you concatenate strings and cast to `int` | Build numbers numerically (`num1 = num1 * 10 + d`) |
| **Ignoring leading zeros** | May mistakenly treat leading zeros as invalid | No action needed – numeric construction naturally handles them |

---

## 10. Interview Tips

1. **Explain the greedy proof** – Show why sorting + alternation gives the minimal sum.
2. **Discuss time/space complexity** – Emphasize the constant‑time nature due to ≤ 10 digits.
3. **Write clean pseudocode first** – Then translate to your chosen language; this demonstrates communication.
4. **Mention edge‑case handling** – Talk through numbers containing zeros, all equal digits, etc.
5. **Talk about defensive coding** – Use `long long`/`int64_t` and handle potential overflow.

## 11. Final Thoughts

LeetCode 2578 “Split With Minimum Sum” is a *classic greedy* problem that blends digit manipulation with careful assignment. The strategy is **short, bullet‑proof, and perfectly suited for interview prep**. Once you master the sorting‑then‑alternating pattern, you’ll be able to solve the related “Minimum Sum of Two Numbers” (LeetCode 1790) and “Minimum Sum of Two Numbers” (LeetCode 1790) with the same mindset.

**Happy coding, and may your next interview be a *minimal‑sum* success!**
