## Split With Minimum Sum – The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly  
**(Leetcode 2578 – Easy)**  

> *“Given a positive integer `num`, split it into two non‑negative integers `num1` and `num2` such that the concatenation of `num1` and `num2` is a permutation of the digits in `num`. Return the minimum possible sum of `num1` and `num2`.”*  

The problem looks deceptively simple, but the best solution is a *single* greedy pass that gives you a perfect interview answer, a clean Java/Python/C++ implementation, and an explanation that recruiters love to see.

### 1️⃣ Problem Overview

| • | 2578. Split With Minimum Sum | Difficulty | Constraints |
|---|------------------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Input** | Integer `num` (`10 ≤ num ≤ 10⁹`) | Easy | `num` has no leading zeros. |
| **Output** | Minimum possible `num1 + num2` | | |
| **Notes** | `num1` and `num2` can contain leading zeros. | | |

Because `num` is at most a 10‑digit number, brute‑forcing all splits is theoretically possible, but the greedy algorithm runs in *O(d log d)*, where `d ≤ 10`.

---

### 2️⃣ The Greedy Insight (The “Good”)

- **Goal:** Keep both numbers as small as possible.  
- **Observation:** The smaller a digit, the less impact it has on the final sum when placed in a higher place value.  
- **Strategy:**  
  1. **Sort all digits ascending** – the smallest digits come first.  
  2. **Distribute alternately** between the two numbers.  
     - Even indices → `num1`, odd indices → `num2`.  
  3. Build each number by appending digits from left to right (most significant → least significant).  

Because we are always picking the smallest available digit for the most significant place in either number, the resulting sum is guaranteed to be minimal.

> **Why alternation works** – It balances the two numbers: if one number gets a 0 at the most significant position, the other also gets the next smallest digit. The resulting carryover in the addition is minimized.

### 3️⃣ The “Bad” – Things that can go wrong

| ✔ | Why it can trip you up |
|---|------------------------|
| **Overflow** | The sum of two 10‑digit numbers fits in a 64‑bit integer (`long` in Java, `long long` in C++). In Java, using `int` is safe because the maximum possible sum is below `2 147 483 647`. In C++ a 32‑bit `int` also suffices, but using `long long` is a defensive habit. |
| **Leading Zeros** | Some naïve solutions ignore that the digits can be re‑ordered arbitrarily. By sorting, we naturally allow leading zeros (they’ll just be at the front of the string and will be dropped when converting to an integer). |
| **Character Conversion Pitfall** | Converting a digit character to an integer incorrectly (`'0' - '0'` vs `c - '0'`) will throw off the arithmetic. |
| **Edge Cases** | If `num` has all the same digits (e.g., `1111`), the algorithm still works – both numbers become the same minimal value. |

---

### 4️⃣ The “Ugly” – Common Mistakes

- **Using a set of digits instead of a sorted array** – the relative order of digits matters for minimizing the sum.  
- **Appending digits to the *right* of the string** – building numbers from the least significant digit leads to reversed numbers.  
- **Relying on `Integer.parseInt` on a long string** – can overflow for 10 digits.  
- **Thinking the problem is “just two numbers”** – you must keep the *multiset* of digits intact; you cannot arbitrarily drop digits.

### 5️⃣ Implementations

Below are clean, production‑ready solutions in **Java, Python, and C++** that you can drop straight into a LeetCode submission.

---

#### 5.1 Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int splitNum(int num) {
        // Convert to array of digits
        char[] digits = String.valueOf(num).toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(digits);                 // ascending

        int num1 = 0, num2 = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < digits.length; i++) {
            int d = digits[i] - '0';
            if ((i & 1) == 0) {              // even index -> num1
                num1 = num1 * 10 + d;
            } else {                         // odd index -> num2
                num2 = num2 * 10 + d;
            }
        }
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}
```

---

#### 5.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def splitNum(self, num: int) -> int:
        digits = sorted(str(num))          # list of chars sorted ascending
        num1, num2 = 0, 0
        for i, d in enumerate(digits):
            d = int(d)
            if i % 2 == 0:
                num1 = num1 * 10 + d
            else:
                num2 = num2 * 10 + d
        return num1 + num2
```

---

#### 5.3 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int splitNum(int num) {
        string s = to_string(num);
        sort(s.begin(), s.end());          // ascending

        long long n1 = 0, n2 = 0;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            int d = s[i] - '0';
            if (i % 2 == 0)
                n1 = n1 * 10 + d;
            else
                n2 = n2 * 10 + d;
        }
        return static_cast<int>(n1 + n2);   // fits in int
    }
};
```

### 6️⃣ Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Sorting digits | **O(d log d)** (d ≤ 10, essentially constant) | **O(d)** for the character array |
| Building two numbers | **O(d)** | **O(1)** (apart from the input array) |
| **Total** | **O(d log d)** | **O(d)** |

Given the constraints, this runs in *microseconds* and easily passes LeetCode’s time limits.

---

### 7️⃣ Testing Strategy

| Test | Input | Expected | Reason |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| Basic | 4325 | 59 | Example from statement |
| Small digits | 10 | 1 | Split 1 & 0 |
| Repeating digits | 1111 | 22 | Both numbers become 11 |
| Leading zero after sort | 907 | 79 | Split 07 & 9 → 7 + 9 = 16? Wait calculation: digits sorted = 0,7,9. num1=0,9 → 9; num2=7 → 7; sum=16. |
| Max input | 9876543210 | 1234567890 | Sorted digits same as input; alternation yields minimal sum. |

Use unit tests in your language of choice to validate.

### 8️⃣ Common Interview Talking Points

- **Explain the greedy rationale**: “We want to keep both numbers small, so we give the smallest digits to the most significant places of each number.”
- **Mention leading zeros**: “Since the order of digits can change, leading zeros are perfectly legal and do not affect the integer value.”
- **Time complexity**: “Sorting 10 digits is trivial; the algorithm is effectively O(1).”
- **Edge case handling**: “All digits identical, or the number containing zero – the algorithm still works because the sorting and alternating strategy is uniform.”

### 9️⃣ FAQ

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| *Why not try all partitions?* | For up to 10 digits, it’s feasible, but the greedy solution is O(1) and far cleaner. |
| *Can we sort descending?* | No – that would put the largest digits in the most significant positions, increasing the sum. |
| *Is there a DP solution?* | It’s overkill for this problem; a greedy approach is optimal. |
| *Does the solution handle negative numbers?* | The problem guarantees `num` is positive, so we don’t need to worry. |
