        ## ‚úÖ 2580 ‚Äì Count Ways to Group Overlapping Ranges  
**Difficulty:** Medium | **Tags:** *Sorting, Intervals, Greedy, Math*  

---

### 1. Problem Recap  

You‚Äôre given an array of integer intervals `ranges[i] = [start·µ¢, end·µ¢]`.  
You must split all intervals into **two** groups (either group may be empty) such that:

* Every interval is in exactly one group.
* Any two **overlapping** intervals must belong to the same group.

Two intervals overlap if they share at least one common integer.

Return the total number of valid splits modulo `1‚ÄØ000‚ÄØ000‚ÄØ007`.

---

### 2. Intuition  

If we picture all intervals on a number line, overlapping intervals form connected ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù (like a chain of touching blocks).  
*Inside one component* all intervals **must** go to the same group.  
*Different components* are independent: we may put the whole component in group‚ÄØ1 or group‚ÄØ2.

Therefore, the answer is simply  

```
answer = 2 ^ (# of components)   (mod 1e9+7)
```

So we only need to count how many connected components exist.

---

### 3. Algorithm  

1. **Sort** all intervals by their start value (`start·µ¢`).  
2. Iterate the sorted list while maintaining the **current maximum end** `currEnd` of the component we‚Äôre building.
3. For each interval `[s, e]`:
   * If `s` > `currEnd` ‚Üí the interval starts a **new component**.  
     * Multiply answer by `2` (mod).  
     * Set `currEnd = e`.
   * Else ‚Üí the interval overlaps the current component.  
     * Update `currEnd = max(currEnd, e)`.
4. Return the final answer.

---

### 4. Correctness Proof  

We prove that the algorithm returns `2^(#components)`.

**Lemma 1**  
After sorting by start, two intervals belong to the same component iff during the scan we never encounter a point where `s > currEnd` between them.

*Proof.*  
If an interval starts after the current component‚Äôs end (`s > currEnd`), there is a gap and the two cannot overlap; thus they are in different components.  
Conversely, if the scan never sees such a gap, each interval‚Äôs start is ‚â§ current end, meaning each successive interval overlaps the current component. Thus they are all connected. ‚àé

**Lemma 2**  
The algorithm creates a new component exactly when a gap appears (`s > currEnd`).

*Proof.*  
The algorithm detects a gap exactly in that condition, multiplies answer by `2`, and resets `currEnd`. No other action multiplies the answer. ‚àé

**Theorem**  
Let `C` be the number of components. The algorithm returns `2^C mod M`.

*Proof.*  
By Lemma‚ÄØ1, the scan partitions the intervals into exactly `C` components.  
By Lemma‚ÄØ2, the answer is multiplied by `2` once per component (the first component is counted by initializing answer =‚ÄØ1 and multiplying on the second component onward).  
Thus after processing all intervals, `answer = 2^C (mod M)`. ‚àé

### 5. Complexity Analysis  

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Sorting | `O(n log n)` | `O(1)` (in‚Äëplace) |
| Scanning | `O(n)` | `O(1)` |
| **Total** | `O(n log n)` | `O(1)` |

`n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`, so the solution easily fits into the limits.

---

### 6. Reference Implementations  

> **All implementations share the same logic** ‚Äì the only difference is language‚Äëspecific syntax.  
> The constant `MOD = 1‚ÄØ000‚ÄØ000‚ÄØ007`.

#### 5.1 Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    private static final long MOD = 1_000_000_007L;

    public int countWays(int[][] ranges) {
        if (ranges.length == 0) return 0; // not needed per constraints

        // 1Ô∏è‚É£ sort by start
        Arrays.sort(ranges, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        long ans = 1;          // 2^0
        long currEnd = Long.MIN_VALUE;   // max end of current component

        for (int[] interval : ranges) {
            long s = interval[0];
            long e = interval[1];

            if (s > currEnd) {          // new component
                ans = (ans * 2) % MOD;  // choose group for this component
                currEnd = e;
            } else {                    // extend current component
                if (e > currEnd) currEnd = e;
            }
        }

        return (int) ans;
    }
}
```

---

#### 5.2 Python 3

```python
MOD = 1_000_000_007

class Solution:
    def countWays(self, ranges: list[list[int]]) -> int:
        ranges.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])      # 1Ô∏è‚É£ sort

        ans = 1
        curr_end = -1 << 60                  # very small

        for s, e in ranges:
            if s > curr_end:                 # 2Ô∏è‚É£ new component
                ans = (ans * 2) % MOD
                curr_end = e
            else:                            # 3Ô∏è‚É£ extend current component
                curr_end = max(curr_end, e)

        return ans
```

---

#### 5.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    const long long MOD = 1'000'000'007LL;

    int countWays(vector<vector<int>>& ranges) {
        if (ranges.empty()) return 0;   // per constraints, not needed

        sort(ranges.begin(), ranges.end(),
             [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b){
                 return a[0] < b[0];
             });

        long long ans = 1;
        long long currEnd = LLONG_MIN;

        for (auto &iv : ranges) {
            long long s = iv[0], e = iv[1];
            if (s > currEnd) {          // new component
                ans = (ans * 2) % MOD;
                currEnd = e;
            } else {                    // same component
                if (e > currEnd) currEnd = e;
            }
        }
        return static_cast<int>(ans);
    }
};
```

### 6. Test‚ÄëDriven Validation  

| Test | `ranges` | Expected | Reason |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | `[[1, 3], [2, 4], [5, 7]]` | `2` | One component ‚Üí 2 ways |
| 2 | `[[1, 4], [2, 3], [5, 6]]` | `4` | Two components ‚Üí 2¬≤ |
| 3 | `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]` | `8` | Three isolated intervals ‚Üí 2¬≥ |
| 4 | `[[1, 10], [2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7], [8, 9]]` | `2` | All overlap ‚Üí single component |
| 5 | `[[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]]` | `16` | No overlaps ‚Üí 4 components |
| 6 | `[[1, 5], [2, 6], [5, 7], [8, 10]]` | `4` | Two components: `[1-7]` and `[8-10]` |

All edge cases work: single component ‚Üí `2`; all disjoint ‚Üí `2^n`; overlapping chain ‚Üí `2`.

---

### 7. Common Pitfalls  

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Forgetting that the two groups may be empty | Initialize `ans = 1` and multiply **only** when a new component is found. |
| Counting a component multiple times due to unsorted input | Always sort by start first. |
| Using 32‚Äëbit int for `ans` when `n` can be 10‚Åµ | Use `long`/`long long` and apply modulus after every multiplication. |
| Misinterpreting ‚Äúoverlap‚Äù as ‚Äúintersection of real intervals‚Äù | Problem guarantees integer endpoints, so a gap of length‚ÄØ0 still separates components. |

---

### 8. Why This Solution is *Good*

* **Simplicity** ‚Äì just sorting + one pass.  
* **Scalability** ‚Äì `O(n log n)` easily handles 10‚Åµ intervals.  
* **Mathematically elegant** ‚Äì answer is a power of two.

---

### 9. When It Can Get Ugly  

* **Very large input** ‚Äì Python‚Äôs built‚Äëin `sort` can hit recursion limits when computing powers. Use `pow(2, components, MOD)` (Python) or an iterative fast‚Äëexponentiation (C++/Java).  
* **Multiple test cases** ‚Äì LeetCode provides a single test case per run, but if you‚Äôre adapting to a batch processor, remember to re‚Äëinitialize `ans = 1` for each case.  
* **Memory‚Äësensitive environment** ‚Äì Sorting in place is fine, but if you‚Äôre constrained to `O(n)` extra memory, you can merge intervals on the fly using a priority queue, though the time stays `O(n log n)`.

---

### 10. Take‚ÄëAway

* Sort ‚Üí one pass ‚Üí count components ‚Üí multiply by 2 for each.  
* The answer is a simple power of two, no heavy data structures needed.  
* Modulo arithmetic is trivial: `ans = ans * 2 % MOD`.

### 3. Example Walk‚Äëthrough  

```text
Input:  [[1,3],[2,4],[5,7]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Intervals [1,3] and [2,4] overlap ‚Üí they must stay together.
- [5,7] is isolated ‚Üí we can put it in either group.
Two valid splits: { [1,3],[2,4] } / { [5,7] }   or   { [5,7] } / { [1,3],[2,4] }.
```

---

### 4. Constraints  

* `1 ‚â§ ranges.length ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`  
* `1 ‚â§ start·µ¢ ‚â§ end·µ¢ ‚â§ 10‚Åπ`  

These constraints hint that an `O(n log n)` algorithm is acceptable, but linear‚Äëtime or quadratic solutions will time‚Äëout.

---

### 5. Intuition & Greedy Insight  

Think of the number line.  
- Overlapping intervals form a connected cluster (a ‚Äúcomponent‚Äù).  
- All intervals inside one component must be in the **same** group.  
- Components are independent ‚Üí for each component you have two choices (group‚ÄØ1 or group‚ÄØ2).  

Thus the answer is `2^(#components)`.

---

### 6. Algorithm Details  

| Step | Action | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| 1 | **Sort** by start | Guarantees that as we walk forward, a new component starts only when the next interval‚Äôs start is greater than the current component‚Äôs end. |
| 2 | Maintain `currEnd` | The farthest end we‚Äôve seen so far in the current component. |
| 3 | For each `[s, e]` |  
- If `s > currEnd`: new component ‚Üí multiply answer by `2`, reset `currEnd = e`.  
- Else: extend component ‚Üí `currEnd = max(currEnd, e)` |  

All logic runs in a single linear pass after sorting.

---

### 7. Pseudocode  

```text
sort ranges by start
ans = 1
currEnd = -‚àû
for (s, e) in ranges:
    if s > currEnd:
        ans = (ans * 2) mod MOD
        currEnd = e
    else:
        currEnd = max(currEnd, e)
return ans
```

---

### 7. Reference Code  

> **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    private static final long MOD = 1_000_000_007L;
    public int countWays(int[][] ranges) {
        Arrays.sort(ranges, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        for (int[] r : ranges) {
            long s = r[0], e = r[1];
            if (s > currEnd) { ans = (ans * 2) % MOD; currEnd = e; }

        }
        return (int) ans;
    }
}
```

> **Python**

        ranges.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        ans, curr_end = 1, -10**18
        for s, e in ranges:
            if s > curr_end:
                ans = (ans * 2) % MOD
                curr_end = e
            else:
                curr_end = max(curr_end, e)
        return ans
```

> **C++**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    const long long MOD = 1'000'000'007LL;
    int countWays(vector<vector<int>>& ranges) {
        sort(ranges.begin(), ranges.end(),
             [](auto &a, auto &b){ return a[0] < b[0]; });
        long long ans = 1, currEnd = LLONG_MIN;
        for (auto &iv : ranges) {

            else if (e > currEnd) currEnd = e;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### 8. Time & Space Complexity  

* **Time:** `O(n log n)` due to sorting, `O(n)` for the pass.  
* **Space:** `O(1)` auxiliary (except for the input array), all in‚Äëplace.

---

### 9. Why It Works ‚Äì Proof Sketch  

1. **Sorting** ensures that once the next start is greater than `currEnd`, no later interval can belong to the current component.  
2. Each time a new component starts, we must decide **which** of the two groups it belongs to.  
3. Since decisions for distinct components do not influence each other, the total number of ways equals the product of independent binary choices ‚Üí `2^(#components)`.

---

### 10. Edge Cases & Final Checks  

* All intervals overlap ‚Üí single component ‚Üí answer `2`.  
* No intervals overlap ‚Üí `n` components ‚Üí answer `2^n`.  
* Verify with `ans = (ans * 2) % MOD` after every multiplication to avoid overflow.  

---

### 11. Frequently Asked Questions  

| Q | A |
|---|---|
| **Can I use a set or hashmap to store components?** | No need ‚Äì a single `currEnd` is enough. |
| **What if `ranges` is empty?** | LeetCode guarantees at least one range, but guard against it if you adapt to other judges. |
| **How to compute `2^components` quickly?** | In Python, `pow(2, components, MOD)`. In Java/C++, use iterative fast exponentiation. |

---

### 12. Interview Tips  

* **Explain the component idea first.**  
* **Show the sorting rationale.**  
* **State the time complexity.**  
* **Mention modulo handling.**  

The interviewer often appreciates a clear ‚Äúwhy we‚Äôre sorting‚Äù explanation.

---

### 13. Takeaway Summary  

* Sort + one pass ‚Üí count independent clusters.  
* The result is a power of two.  
* Code is short in any language.
