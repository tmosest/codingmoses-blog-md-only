        ## 1.  Problem Recap  

**LeetCode‚ÄØ2585 ‚Äì Number of Ways to Earn Points**  

> You have `n` types of questions.  
> `types[i] = [count·µ¢, mark·µ¢]` means there are `count·µ¢` indistinguishable questions of the *i‚Äëth* type and each question is worth `mark·µ¢` points.  
> You are given an integer `target`.  
> Return the number of different ways to earn **exactly** `target` points.  
> Because the answer can be huge, return it modulo `10‚Åπ‚ÄØ+‚ÄØ7`.  

`target ‚â§ 1000`, `n ‚â§ 50`, `count·µ¢, mark·µ¢ ‚â§ 50`.

## 2.  Intuition ‚Äì A bounded knapsack

Every type of question behaves like a **bounded item** in a classic 0/1‚Äëknapsack:

| item | weight | value | bound |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| type *i* | `mark·µ¢` | `mark·µ¢` | `count·µ¢` |

We do **not** care about the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù (points earned), only about how many ways we can fill a knapsack of capacity `target` using at most `count·µ¢` copies of each item.  
Thus the problem is exactly a **bounded knapsack counting** problem.

The most common way to solve this in interview settings is a **bottom‚Äëup DP** that iterates over the items and updates the DP table in *reverse* order, so that each item is used at most once per DP state.

---

## 3.  Bottom‚ÄëUp DP (Iterative) ‚Äì The ‚Äúgood‚Äù solution

### 3.1  DP definition  

`dp[s]` ‚Äì number of ways to reach a score of `s` using the processed types.

Initialize:  
`dp[0] = 1` ‚Äì there is one way to score zero points (solve nothing).  
All other entries start at `0`.

### 3.2  Transition  

For each type `(cnt, mark)`:

```
for s from target down to 1:
    for k from 1 to cnt:
        if s - k*mark < 0: break
        dp[s] = (dp[s] + dp[s - k*mark]) mod M
```

Why iterate **backwards**?  
If we updated `dp` forwards we would reuse the same type more than `cnt` times within the same iteration.  
The reverse loop guarantees that every update uses a state that *does not yet* include the current type.

### 3.3  Complexity  

*Time*: `O(target √ó n √ó max(count·µ¢))` ‚Äì worst case `‚âà 1000 √ó 50 √ó 50 = 2.5‚ÄØM` operations.  
*Space*: `O(target)` ‚Äì one 1‚ÄëD array of length `target+1`.

The solution passes comfortably within the limits and is easy to reason about in an interview.

### 3.4  Code

```java
// Java 17
public class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

    public int waysToReachTarget(int target, int[][] types) {
        int[] dp = new int[target + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;                      // base case

        for (int[] t : types) {
            int cnt  = t[0];
            int mark = t[1];

            for (int s = target; s >= 1; s--) {
                for (int k = 1; k <= cnt; k++) {
                    int prev = s - k * mark;
                    if (prev < 0) break;
                    dp[s] = (dp[s] + dp[prev]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[target];
    }
}
```

```python
# Python 3.11
class Solution:
    MOD = 1_000_000_007

    def waysToReachTarget(self, target: int, types: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (target + 1)
        dp[0] = 1

        for cnt, mark in types:
            for s in range(target, 0, -1):
                for k in range(1, cnt + 1):
                    prev = s - k * mark
                    if prev < 0:
                        break
                    dp[s] = (dp[s] + dp[prev]) % self.MOD

        return dp[target]
```

```cpp
// C++17
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    static constexpr int MOD = 1'000'000'007;
    int waysToReachTarget(int target, vector<vector<int>>& types) {
        vector<int> dp(target + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;

        for (auto &t : types) {
            int cnt  = t[0];
            int mark = t[1];
            for (int s = target; s >= 1; --s) {
                for (int k = 1; k <= cnt; ++k) {
                    int prev = s - k * mark;
                    if (prev < 0) break;
                    dp[s] += dp[prev];
                    if (dp[s] >= MOD) dp[s] -= MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[target];
    }
};
```

## 4.  Top‚ÄëDown DP + Memoization ‚Äì The ‚Äúbad‚Äù solution that still works

If you are more comfortable with recursion, the **DFS + memoization** version is very readable:

```python
# Python 3.11
from functools import lru_cache

class Solution:
    MOD = 1_000_000_007

    def waysToReachTarget(self, target: int, types: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(i: int, remaining: int) -> int:
            if remaining == 0:
                return 1
            if i == len(types) or remaining < 0:
                return 0

            cnt, mark = types[i]
            total = 0
            for k in range(cnt + 1):            # 0 ‚Ä¶ cnt copies of current type
                total += dfs(i + 1, remaining - k * mark)
            return total % self.MOD

        return dfs(0, target)
```

**Pros**  
* Intuitive recursion + memoization (state = `(i, remaining)`).

**Cons**  
* Requires `O(target √ó n)` memory for the cache (about 50‚ÄØk integers in the worst case) ‚Äì still fine, but more overhead than the iterative 1‚ÄëD array.  
* May be slower in tight runtime environments because of function call overhead.

---

## 5.  ‚ÄúThe ugly‚Äù ‚Äì A naive 3‚Äënested‚Äëloop that breaks the constraints

```java
// Wrong: O(target¬≤ √ó n) ‚Äì far too slow for the limits
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int s = 0; s <= target; s++) {
        for (int k = 0; k <= types[i][0]; k++) {   // reuse the same type many times
            if (s + k*mark <= target) {
                dp[s + k*mark] += dp[s];
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- This forward update **over‚Äëcounts** because the same type is reused in the same iteration.  
- It also has a cubic factor (`target √ó target √ó n`), which is too big for `target‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1000`.

**Never** show this in an interview unless you have time to correct it on the spot.

---

## 6.  Which solution should you bring to the interview?

| Situation | Recommended approach |
|-----------|----------------------|
| *Time is tight, interviewer wants a quick idea* | Bottom‚Äëup iterative DP (reverse loops). |
| *You want to show elegance and use recursion* | Top‚Äëdown DP + `@lru_cache` (Python) or memoized recursion (Java/C++). |
| *The interviewer specifically asks for ‚Äúbounded knapsack‚Äù* | Discuss the analogy, then present the reverse‚Äëloop transition. |

**Tip** ‚Äì Always mention the **reverse‚Äëorder trick** for bounded items; interviewers love to see that you know how to prevent double‚Äëcounting.

---

## 7.  Interview‚ÄëReady Checklist

1. **Clarify the ‚Äúindistinguishable‚Äù assumption** ‚Äì we are counting *combinations*, not permutations.  
2. **Explain the DP state** (`dp[s]` ‚Äì ways to reach score `s`).  
3. **Show the reverse iteration** ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhy do we iterate backwards? It guarantees that each type is used at most its bound.‚Äù  
4. **Mention modulo handling** ‚Äì `dp[s] = (dp[s] + dp[prev]) % MOD`.  
5. **Give complexity** ‚Äì `O(target * n * maxCount)` time, `O(target)` space.  
6. **Optional** ‚Äì If asked, present the top‚Äëdown version as a cleaner, albeit slightly slower, alternative.

## ‚úÖ The Good: Bottom‚ÄëUp DP (Bounded Knapsack)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ DP State  
`dp[s]` ‚Äì ways to score exactly `s` points after processing some question types.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Transition  
For each `(cnt, mark)` iterate scores **backwards** and add all feasible copies:

```pseudo
for s = target .. 1:
    for k = 1 .. cnt:
        if s - k*mark < 0: break
        dp[s] = (dp[s] + dp[s - k*mark]) % MOD
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Complexity  
*Time* `O(target √ó n √ó max(count))` ‚Äì ‚âà‚ÄØ2.5‚ÄØM ops.  
*Space* `O(target)`.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Java 17 Code

```java
public class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
    public int waysToReachTarget(int target, int[][] types) {
        int[] dp = new int[target + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int[] t : types) {
            int cnt = t[0], mark = t[1];
            for (int s = target; s >= 1; s--) {
                for (int k = 1; k <= cnt; k++) {
                    int prev = s - k * mark;
                    if (prev < 0) break;
                    dp[s] = (dp[s] + dp[prev]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[target];
    }
}
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Python 3.11 Code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    MOD = 1_000_000_007
    def waysToReachTarget(self, target: int, types: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (target + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        for cnt, mark in types:
            for s in range(target, 0, -1):
                for k in range(1, cnt + 1):
                    prev = s - k * mark
                    if prev < 0:
                        break
                    dp[s] = (dp[s] + dp[prev]) % self.MOD
        return dp[target]
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ C++17 Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    static constexpr int MOD = 1'000'000'007;
    int waysToReachTarget(int target, vector<vector<int>>& types) {
        vector<int> dp(target + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (auto &t : types) {
            int cnt = t[0], mark = t[1];
            for (int s = target; s >= 1; --s) {
                for (int k = 1; k <= cnt; ++k) {
                    int prev = s - k * mark;
                    if (prev < 0) break;
                    dp[s] += dp[prev];
                    if (dp[s] >= MOD) dp[s] -= MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[target];
    }
};
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Bad: Na√Øve Forward DP

If you mistakenly iterate scores **forwards** you‚Äôll double‚Äëcount combinations and explode the runtime:

```java
for (int s = 0; s <= target; s++) {
    for (int k = 0; k <= cnt; k++) {
        if (s + k*mark <= target) dp[s + k*mark] += dp[s];
    }
}
```

*Why it fails* ‚Äì forward updates let the same question type be reused in the same iteration.  
Time: `O(target¬≤ √ó n)` ‚Äì infeasible for `target‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1000`.

---

## üëø The Ugly: Deep Recursion

Recursion is clean but may hit stack limits.  Use memoization to keep it efficient:

```python
@lru_cache(None)
def dfs(i, remaining):
    ...
```

The overhead of function calls and a larger memo table (‚âà‚ÄØ50‚ÄØk ints) makes it a less attractive choice when speed matters.

## üìã Cheat Sheet

| Step | What to explain | Code snippet (Java) |
|------|----------------|--------------------|
| 1 | Clarify ‚Äúcombinations, not permutations.‚Äù | `dp[0] = 1;` |
| 2 | DP state definition | `int[] dp = new int[target + 1];` |
| 3 | Reverse iteration rationale | `for (int s = target; s >= 1; s--)` |
| 4 | Add all valid copies | `for (int k = 1; k <= cnt; k++)` |
| 5 | Modulo handling | `dp[s] = (dp[s] + dp[prev]) % MOD;` |
| 6 | Complexity | `O(target √ó n √ó max(count))` |
