        # 🎯 2592 – Maximize Greatness of an Array  
**LeetCode Medium | 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁵ | 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁹**

> **Goal:**  
> We may permute the array `nums` arbitrarily.  
> “Greatness” of a permutation `perm` is the count of indices `i` where `perm[i] > nums[i]`.  
> Return the maximum possible greatness.

## Why this problem matters for a software‑engineer interview

1. **Greedy + Two‑Pointer mindset** – a classic interview staple.  
2. **Array manipulation + sorting** – shows your ability to use standard libraries and think about time‑space trade‑offs.  
3. **Edge‑case handling** – duplicates, large input size, single‑element arrays.  
4. **Readable code** – interviewer wants clean, well‑documented solutions.

Below you’ll find **three production‑ready implementations** (Java, Python, C++), followed by a **SEO‑friendly blog post** that you can paste into a personal site or LinkedIn article to impress recruiters.

## 1️⃣ Solutions

### Common Strategy

1. **Sort** the array (`O(n log n)`).
2. Use a *two‑pointer* scan:  
   * `i` – index in the original sorted array (`nums`) that we want to beat.  
   * `j` – index of a candidate element that might beat `nums[i]`.  
3. If `nums[j] > nums[i]`, we found a “win”: increment `greatness`, `i++`, `j++`.  
4. Else (`nums[j] <= nums[i]`), move `j` forward to find a larger element.

This greedy proof works because we always pair the smallest remaining element that can beat the current target. Once a larger element is used, it can never help to beat a smaller target later, so the greedy choice is safe.

### Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maximizeGreatness(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);          // O(n log n)
        int i = 0;                  // target index
        int j = 0;                  // candidate index
        int greatness = 0;

        while (i < nums.length && j < nums.length) {
            if (nums[j] > nums[i]) {      // we win this position
                greatness++;
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {                       // candidate too small, skip
                j++;
            }
        }
        return greatness;
    }
}
```

**Time** : `O(n log n)` (sorting)  
**Space** : `O(1)` (in‑place sorting if allowed, otherwise `O(n)`)

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def maximizeGreatness(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()                # O(n log n)
        i = 0                      # target
        j = 0                      # candidate
        greatness = 0

        while i < len(nums) and j < len(nums):
            if nums[j] > nums[i]:
                greatness += 1
                i += 1
                j += 1
            else:
                j += 1
        return greatness
```

### C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximizeGreatness(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());   // O(n log n)
        int i = 0, j = 0, greatness = 0;
        while (i < nums.size() && j < nums.size()) {
            if (nums[j] > nums[i]) {
                ++greatness;
                ++i;
                ++j;
            } else {
                ++j;
            }
        }
        return greatness;
    }
};
```

### Introduction

In the world of coding interviews, LeetCode problems are the gold standard.  
**Problem 2592 – “Maximize Greatness of an Array”** is a prime example of a medium‑level challenge that tests your ability to:

- Think greedily
- Use sorting and two‑pointer techniques
- Handle edge cases efficiently

Below, we dissect the *good* (why the problem is great for interviews), the *bad* (common mistakes), and the *ugly* (gotchas that trip candidates). We’ll finish with SEO‑friendly takeaways that can land you a job interview.

---

## 📌 The Good – Why This Problem is a Must‑Know

| Skill | How the Problem Demonstrates It |
|-------|---------------------------------|
| **Greedy algorithms** | We pick the smallest element that can beat the current target. The proof is straightforward and showcases your ability to design optimal strategies. |
| **Two‑pointer technique** | A classic interview pattern that reveals your comfort with array manipulation. |
| **Time‑space trade‑offs** | Sorting is `O(n log n)` but is still the fastest approach for arbitrary input sizes. |
| **Edge‑case handling** | Duplicates, single‑element arrays, all‑equal arrays—all are handled naturally by the algorithm. |

*Takeaway:* Mastering this problem gives you a reusable pattern that appears in many interview questions (e.g., “Maximum Wins in a Card Game”, “Maximum Number of Pairings”, etc.).

---

## ⚠️ The Bad – Common Pitfalls

1. **Assuming a linear‑time solution**  
   - Many candidates try to skip sorting, but you must compare each element to a larger one. Without sorting, you cannot guarantee optimality.  
2. **Using a naive permutation approach**  
   - Generating all permutations (`O(n!)`) is impossible for `n = 10⁵`.  
3. **Wrong pointer logic**  
   - Forgetting to increment `i` after a win leads to infinite loops or incorrect counts.  
4. **Ignoring duplicate values**  
   - Some candidates think `nums[j] > nums[i]` is enough; the equality case must be handled correctly (`>` only, not `>=`).  

*Advice:* Write unit tests for edge cases before implementing the final solution.

---

## 😱 The Ugly – Hidden Gotchas

| Gotcha | Why It Happens | Fix |
|--------|----------------|-----|
| **Off‑by‑one errors** | In a two‑pointer loop, a mis‑placement of `j++` inside or outside the `if` block changes the outcome. | Double‑check loop invariants. |
| **Uninitialized variable `greatness`** | In some languages (e.g., Java), forgetting to initialize `greatness` to 0 leads to a `NullPointerException`. | Initialize it immediately. |
| **Using a `while` loop that never terminates** | If `i` never moves when `nums[j] <= nums[i]`, `j` must still advance. | Ensure `j++` in the `else` branch. |
| **Large input size causing stack overflow** | Recursion (not used here) could overflow if someone mistakenly writes a recursive solution. | Stick to iterative loops. |

## 🚀 How This Problem Helps You Land a Job

1. **Clear code + comments** – Recruiters love readable solutions.  
2. **Time‑complexity awareness** – Demonstrates that you can choose the right algorithm for constraints.  
3. **Problem‑decomposition** – Shows you can break a problem into sorting + greedy.  
4. **Testing mindset** – Mention how you’d write unit tests for the edge cases.  

Include the solution on your portfolio site or a GitHub repo with a brief README. Use keywords like **“LeetCode 2592”, “Greedy algorithm”, “Two pointers”, “Array manipulation”** to boost SEO.
