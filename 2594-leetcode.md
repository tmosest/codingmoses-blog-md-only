        ## üöó 2594 ‚Äì Minimum Time to Repair Cars  
**Medium ‚Äì LeetCode ‚Äì Binary Search**  

> *A mechanic with rank **r** repairs **n** cars in `r ¬∑ n¬≤` minutes.  
>  Given an array `ranks` and the number of cars `cars`, return the minimum time needed if all mechanics work simultaneously.*

---

### TL;DR ‚Äì One‚Äëliner solution idea

1. **Binary Search** over the answer (time).  
2. For a candidate time `t`, compute how many cars each mechanic can fix:  
   `cars_i = ‚åä‚àö(t / r_i)‚åã`.  
3. Sum over all mechanics; if the sum ‚â• `cars`, `t` is feasible.  
4. Narrow the search until the smallest feasible time is found.

## 1.  Algorithm Walk‚Äëthrough

| Step | Action | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **1** | Find lower & upper bounds of time | `1` (min possible) and `min(ranks) * cars¬≤` (fastest mechanic does everything). |
| **2** | Binary search between `left` and `right` | Classic `O(log(maxTime))` search. |
| **3** | `canRepair(t)` | For each mechanic `r`, `n = floor(sqrt(t / r))`. Add up `n`. |
| **4** | Return left when search converges | Guarantees minimal feasible time. |

> **Time Complexity**:  
> `O(m ¬∑ log(minRank ¬∑ cars¬≤))` where `m = ranks.length`.  
>  
> **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` (aside from input storage).

---

## 2.  Implementation

### 2.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public long repairCars(int[] ranks, int cars) {
        long left = 1;
        long right = (long) Collections.min(Arrays.stream(ranks).boxed().toList()) * cars * cars;
        // Helper to check if time 'mid' can finish all cars
        while (left < right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canRepair(mid, ranks, cars)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }

    private boolean canRepair(long time, int[] ranks, int cars) {
        long total = 0;
        for (int rank : ranks) {
            // n = floor(sqrt(time / rank))
            long n = (long) Math.floor(Math.sqrt((double) time / rank));
            total += n;
            if (total >= cars) return true;      // early exit
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

> **Why `long`?**  
> `cars ‚â§ 10‚Å∂` and `ranks[i] ‚â§ 100`; the upper bound may reach `10‚Å∏`.  
> Using `int` risks overflow when squaring.

---

### 2.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def repairCars(self, ranks: list[int], cars: int) -> int:
        left, right = 1, min(ranks) * cars * cars

        def can(time: int) -> bool:
            total = 0
            for r in ranks:
                # cars a mechanic can fix in 'time'
                n = int((time // r) ** 0.5)      # floor sqrt
                total += n
                if total >= cars:
                    return True
            return False

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if can(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```

> **Tip** ‚Äì `int((time // r) ** 0.5)` is faster than `math.isqrt()` for large numbers because it uses float sqrt and then truncates. For production, `math.isqrt` would be safer.

---

### 2.3 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long repairCars(vector<int>& ranks, int cars) {
        long long left = 1;
        long long right = *min_element(ranks.begin(), ranks.end())
                         * 1LL * cars * cars;

        auto can = [&](long long t)->bool {
            long long total = 0;
            for (int r : ranks) {
                long long n = sqrt((long double)t / r);
                total += n;
                if (total >= cars) return true;
            }
            return false;
        };

        while (left < right) {
            long long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (can(mid)) right = mid;
            else left = mid + 1;
        }
        return left;
    }
};
```

> **Note** ‚Äì use `long double` for the division to avoid precision loss.

### 3.2 Introduction

> **‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre tackling LeetCode‚Äôs *Minimum Time to Repair Cars*, you‚Äôre about to dive into a classic *binary search on the answer* problem.  
>  In this post we‚Äôll walk through the optimal algorithm, provide clean code in the three most popular languages, and break down what makes this problem *good*, *bad*, and *ugly* from an interview‚Äëperspective.‚Äù**

---

### 3.3 The Good ‚Äì Why the Problem is Valuable

| Aspect | Why it‚Äôs good |
|--------|---------------|
| **Conceptual clarity** | It isolates binary search on a *continuous* domain (time) ‚Äì a common interview theme. |
| **Math & math‚Äëintuitive** | The `rank * n¬≤` formula leads to a neat square‚Äëroot calculation. |
| **Performance** | With `O(m log(maxTime))` it scales to the constraints (`m = 1e5`). |
| **Real‚Äëworld analogy** | Similar to *factory scheduling*, *distributed processing* ‚Äì a practical mental model. |
| **Testing diversity** | Edge cases (1 mechanic, 1 car; all ranks equal; huge `cars` value) keep the solver sharp. |

> **Result:** Interviewers love it because it tests *algorithmic thinking* and *careful handling of bounds*.

---

### 3.4 The Bad ‚Äì Common Pitfalls & Misread

| Mistake | Why it hurts |
|---------|--------------|
| **Off‚Äëby‚Äëone in binary search** | Many candidates return `mid` or `mid+1` incorrectly, yielding wrong answers for tight bounds. |
| **Overflow** | Multiplying `cars¬≤` (up to `10¬π¬≤`) in an `int` variable blows up. |
| **Using float sqrt naively** | Precision errors when `time / rank` is huge; `math.isqrt` or `sqrtl` in C++ avoids this. |
| **Ignoring early exit** | Summing all cars even after reaching `cars` leads to wasted cycles in the worst case. |
| **Assuming `cars` fits in `int`** | When returning answer, use `long`/`long long` to be safe. |

> **Tip:** Start by writing a helper `canRepair()` and test it separately on corner cases.

---

### 3.5 The Ugly ‚Äì Subtle Edge Cases

1. **Minimal time is 0?**  
   *No, at least one car must be repaired; minimal feasible time is ‚â•1.*  
2. **All mechanics have the same high rank**  
   The answer may still be `cars¬≤ * rank`, stressing the search range.  
3. **Very large `cars` (1e6) with minimal rank 1**  
   Upper bound is `1e12`, which is fine for 64‚Äëbit but *not* for 32‚Äëbit.  
4. **Precision in sqrt**  
   For `t = 10¬π¬≤` and `r = 100`, `sqrt(1e10)` = 100000, which fits in `int`.  
   Yet if you accidentally cast to `float`, you get 99999.999, floor to 99999 ‚Äì wrong!  
5. **Negative or zero `cars`**  
   Not allowed by constraints, but defensive code can guard against it.
