## 1.  Problem Recap  

**LeetCode 2594 – Minimum Time to Repair Cars**  

You’re given:

| Variable | Meaning | Constraints |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ranks[i]` | Rank of the *i*‑th mechanic (`1 ≤ ranks[i] ≤ 100`) | `1 ≤ ranks.length ≤ 10⁵` |
| `cars` | Total number of cars that must be repaired (`1 ≤ cars ≤ 10⁶`) | – |

A mechanic of rank `r` repairs `n` cars in `r · n²` minutes.  
All mechanics work **simultaneously**.  
Return the *minimum* time needed to finish all `cars`.

---

## 2.  Algorithmic Idea  

The problem is a typical **“minimum feasible value”** problem – we can test whether a given time `T` is sufficient and then binary‑search for the smallest `T`.

1. **Feasibility Test**  
   For a candidate time `T`, how many cars can a mechanic of rank `r` repair?

   \[
   r \cdot n^2 \le T \;\;\Longrightarrow\;\; n \le \sqrt{\frac{T}{r}}
   \]

   So each mechanic can repair  
   `floor( sqrt(T / r) )` cars.

   Sum that over all mechanics; if the sum ≥ `cars`, then `T` is feasible.

2. **Binary Search**  
   * **Low** = 1 minute (the smallest possible time).  
   * **High** = `min(ranks) * cars²`.  
     (If the fastest mechanic worked alone, this would be the worst‑case time.)  

   While `low < high`:
   * `mid = (low + high) / 2`
   * If `mid` is feasible → `high = mid`
   * else → `low = mid + 1`

   The loop terminates with `low == high` = the minimal feasible time.

3. **Complexities**

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Feasibility test | `O(m)` (one pass over mechanics) | `O(1)` |
| Binary search | `O(m log(maxTime))` | `O(1)` |
| Overall | `O(m log(cars·minRank))` | `O(1)` |

With `m ≤ 10⁵` and `cars ≤ 10⁶`, this easily meets LeetCode’s limits.

## 3.  Code – 4 Languages

Below are self‑contained implementations for **Java, Python, C++**, and **HolyC** (TempleOS).  
All versions share the same logic, just adapted to each language’s syntax.

> **Tip for interviewers** – Mention the *logarithmic* search on the time domain, the closed‑form for `n`, and that the solution is `O(n log n)` in the number of mechanics, not `O(n²)` or worse.

### 3.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public long repairCars(int[] ranks, int cars) {
        int minRank = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int r : ranks) minRank = Math.min(minRank, r);

        long low = 1L;
        long high = (long) minRank * cars * cars;   // worst‑case

        while (low < high) {
            long mid = (low + high) >>> 1;          // (low+high)/2 without overflow
            if (canFinish(mid, ranks, cars)) {
                high = mid;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }

    private boolean canFinish(long time, int[] ranks, int cars) {
        long total = 0;
        for (int r : ranks) {
            long possible = (long) Math.floor(Math.sqrt((double) time / r));
            total += possible;
            if (total >= cars) return true;         // early exit
        }
        return total >= cars;
    }

    /*  Simple driver for quick sanity check
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution s = new Solution();
        System.out.println(s.repairCars(new int[]{4,2,3,1}, 10)); // 16
        System.out.println(s.repairCars(new int[]{5,1,8}, 6));   // 16
    }
    */
}
```

> **Why Java?** Java is the most commonly requested language in top tech interviews.  
> The solution uses `long` for safety (max time can be ~10¹⁰).

---

### 3.2 Python

```python
import math
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def repairCars(self, ranks: List[int], cars: int) -> int:
        min_rank = min(ranks)
        low, high = 1, min_rank * cars * cars

        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if self._can_finish(mid, ranks, cars):
                high = mid
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        return low

    def _can_finish(self, time: int, ranks: List[int], cars: int) -> bool:
        total = 0
        for r in ranks:
            total += int(math.isqrt(time // r))   # floor sqrt
            if total >= cars:
                return True
        return False

#  # quick sanity check
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     sol = Solution()
#     print(sol.repairCars([4, 2, 3, 1], 10))  # 16
#     print(sol.repairCars([5, 1, 8], 6))      # 16
```

> **Why Python?** LeetCode’s “Python 3” environment is used in many coding‑bootcamps and online tests.  
> Using `math.isqrt` keeps everything integer‑only and fast.

---

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long repairCars(vector<int>& ranks, int cars) {
        int minRank = *min_element(ranks.begin(), ranks.end());
        long long low = 1;
        long long high = 1LL * minRank * cars * cars;   // worst case

        while (low < high) {
            long long mid = (low + high) >> 1;
            if (canFinish(mid, ranks, cars)) high = mid;
            else                              low  = mid + 1;
        }
        return low;
    }

private:
    bool canFinish(long long time, const vector<int>& ranks, int cars) {
        long long total = 0;
        for (int r : ranks) {
            total += (long long) sqrt(time / (double)r);
            if (total >= cars) return true;
        }
        return total >= cars;
    }
};
```

> **Why C++?** Fast execution, explicit control of integer types.  
> Using `double` for `sqrt` is safe because the argument is at most `10¹⁰`; the cast to `long long` floors automatically.

### 3.4 HolyC (TempleOS)

HolyC is a very small, C‑like language used in the TempleOS project.  
The syntax is almost identical to C but with a few quirks.

```c
// HolyC – Minimum Time to Repair Cars
// compile: holyc -o repairCars repairCars.holy

void repairCars( long ranks[], long len, long cars, out long answer )
{
    long i, low, high, mid, total;
    long minRank = 1000;

    // find minimum rank
    for i = 0 to len-1 do
        if ranks[i] < minRank
            minRank = ranks[i]
        end
    end

    low = 1
    high = minRank * cars * cars

    while low < high do
        mid = (low + high) / 2

        total = 0
        for i = 0 to len-1 do
            total += Sqrt(mid / ranks[i])    // floor sqrt
            if total >= cars
                break
            end
        end

        if total >= cars
            high = mid
        else
            low = mid + 1
        end
    end

    answer = low
end
```

> **Why HolyC?**  
> It demonstrates that the algorithm is language‑agnostic; even in a niche language you can express it cleanly.  
> HolyC’s built‑in `Sqrt` returns a `float`; casting to `long` truncates automatically.

---

### 1. Introduction  
If you’ve ever stared at LeetCode’s “Minimum Time to Repair Cars” and felt like you’re staring at a black hole, you’re not alone. The problem appears simple, but its constraints (10⁵ mechanics, 10⁶ cars) trip up many naive solutions. In this post, I’ll walk through:

* The **good** – what makes the problem solvable
* The **bad** – common pitfalls
* The **ugly** – hidden traps you should watch out for

…and show a production‑ready solution you can drop straight into your interview.

---

### 2. The Good – Why Binary Search Wins  
**Closed‑Form Feasibility**  
The key is realizing that each mechanic’s repair time is a quadratic in `n`. By rearranging:

```
n <= sqrt(T / r)
```

you get an *exact* upper bound on the cars a mechanic can handle in `T` minutes. This eliminates loops inside loops.

**Logarithmic Time Search**  
Because the feasible times form a *monotonic* set (if 30 minutes works, 31+ do too), binary search is the natural choice. You’re searching in a **time** domain, not the usual array index domain.

**Simplicity & Reusability**  
The solution is just two functions: `canFinish` and a binary loop. You can port it to any language with ease—Java, Python, C++, HolyC, even Brainfuck (if you’re feeling adventurous).

---

### 3. The Bad – Common Traps  
| Pitfall | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **O(m·cars)** naive simulation | 10⁵ × 10⁶ = 10¹¹ operations → TLE | Use `sqrt` closed form |
| **Floating‑point rounding** | Small errors accumulate, potentially mis‑counting cars | Stick to integer math (`math.isqrt`, `floor(sqrt(...))`) |
| **Overflow** in high bound | `minRank * cars²` can exceed 32‑bit | Use 64‑bit integers (`long` / `long long`) |
| **Early exit omission** | Extra loops waste time | Break when total ≥ cars |

> **Interview hint** – If you’re asked to justify your approach, mention *why* early exit matters (worst‑case still O(n log n), but early exit can shave milliseconds).

---

### 4. The Ugly – Hidden Complexity That Surprises Even Experienced Coders  
* **Reading the problem statement carefully**  
  Many candidates misinterpret the “simultaneously” part and think of serial scheduling. Clarify: every mechanic runs their own `n²` formula independently; the total time is **max** of all, not sum.

* **Handling large squares**  
  When squaring `cars`, you risk 32‑bit overflow. In C/C++, use `1LL * …`; in Java, use `long`; in Python, integers are unbounded.

* **TempleOS / HolyC niche**  
  If your interview team uses a less common language, you need to adapt the solution. HolyC’s `Sqrt` returns float, so you must cast. In languages without integer `sqrt`, you risk floating‑point inaccuracies.

---

### 5. Implementation Checklist  

| Language | Common Issues | Checklist |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Java | `>>>` vs `/ 2`, overflow | Use `>>> 1` or `>>> 1` |
| Python | `math.sqrt` vs `math.isqrt` | Prefer `isqrt` for integer precision |
| C++ | `sqrt(double)` precision | Use `sqrt((double) value)` and cast to `long long` |
| HolyC | `Sqrt` returns float | Cast to `long` to floor |

---

### 6. Interview Prep & SEO Takeaway  
* **Algorithmic clarity** – Binary search + feasibility = interview‑ready pattern.  
* **Write clean code** – Keep helper functions small, use early exits.  
* **SEO‑friendly** – Use keyword “LeetCode 2594”, “binary search”, “O(n log n)” in headings and alt text for images.

---

### 7. Conclusion  
LeetCode 2594 is a textbook example of a problem that rewards *mathematical insight* over brute force. By turning the repair time into a feasibility test, and then binary‑searching on that time, we reduce a potential `10¹¹` operations to under `2 × 10⁶`.  

Whether you’re coding in Java, Python, C++, or even HolyC, the core logic stays the same. Master this pattern, and you’ll be ready for a whole host of similar “minimum feasible” interview questions.

Happy coding – and may your binary search always converge fast! 🚀
