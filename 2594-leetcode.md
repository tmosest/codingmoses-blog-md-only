        ## 1. Problem Recap – Minimum Time to Repair Cars  

**LeetCode 2594 – Minimum Time to Repair Cars**  
> *Medium*  

You are given `ranks[]`, the rank of each mechanic, and an integer `cars` that tells how many cars need to be repaired.  
A mechanic with rank `r` needs `r × n²` minutes to repair `n` cars.  
All mechanics can work **simultaneously** and we want the **minimum time** required to finish all `cars`.

| Example | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| `ranks = [4,2,3,1]`, `cars = 10` | Minimum time is `16` minutes |
| `ranks = [5,1,8]`, `cars = 6` | Minimum time is `16` minutes |

Constraints  
- `1 ≤ ranks.length ≤ 10⁵`  
- `1 ≤ ranks[i] ≤ 100`  
- `1 ≤ cars ≤ 10⁶`

The time limit is tight – a **brute‑force simulation** will not finish in time.

---

## 2. Solution Idea – Binary Search on Time  

The problem is a classic “feasibility‑check” + “binary search” pattern.

* For a fixed amount of time `t` we can ask: **How many cars can all mechanics repair together?**  
  *A mechanic with rank `r` can repair `n` cars iff `r × n² ≤ t`.  
   Thus `n = ⌊√(t / r)⌋`.*

* If the sum over all mechanics is **≥ cars**, then time `t` is feasible.  
  *Otherwise, we need more time.*

Because the answer is an integer and the feasibility function is **monotonic** (if a time works, every larger time works), we can binary‑search on `t`:

```
low  = 0                          // 0 minutes is always too small
high = min_rank * cars²           // fastest mechanic alone

while low < high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if can_repair_all(mid):   // feasibility test
        high = mid            // mid is enough – try smaller
    else:
        low = mid + 1         // mid is not enough – need more
return low
```

The complexity is  
- **Time:** `O(m log (min_rank · cars²))` where `m = ranks.length`.  
- **Space:** `O(1)` – only a few variables.

The logarithm is tiny (≈ 30 for the maximal constraints), so the solution easily fits the limits.

## 3. Reference Implementations  

Below are clean, ready‑to‑paste solutions in **Java, Python, and C++**.  
All three use the same binary‑search strategy and run in `O(m log …)` time.

### 3.1 Java (Long Arithmetic)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public long repairCars(int[] ranks, int cars) {
        long minRank = Arrays.stream(ranks).min().getAsInt();
        long left = 0;
        long right = minRank * (long) cars * cars;   // worst case

        while (left < right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canRepair(ranks, cars, mid)) {
                right = mid;          // mid works – try smaller
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;       // mid too small
            }
        }
        return left;
    }

    private boolean canRepair(int[] ranks, int cars, long time) {
        long total = 0;
        for (int r : ranks) {
            long maxCars = (long) Math.floor(Math.sqrt((double) time / r));
            total += maxCars;
            if (total >= cars) return true;   // early stop
        }
        return total >= cars;
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Python

```python
import math
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def repairCars(self, ranks: List[int], cars: int) -> int:
        min_rank = min(ranks)
        lo, hi = 0, min_rank * cars * cars

        while lo < hi:
            mid = (lo + hi) // 2
            if self._can_repair(ranks, cars, mid):
                hi = mid            # feasible, try smaller
            else:
                lo = mid + 1        # infeasible, need more time
        return lo

    def _can_repair(self, ranks: List[int], cars: int, time: int) -> bool:
        total = 0
        for r in ranks:
            total += int(math.isqrt(time // r))
            if total >= cars:
                return True
        return False
```

### 3.3 C++ (64‑bit)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long repairCars(vector<int>& ranks, int cars) {
        long long minRank = *min_element(ranks.begin(), ranks.end());
        long long low = 0, high = minRank * 1LL * cars * cars;

        while (low < high) {
            long long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (canRepair(ranks, cars, mid))
                high = mid;          // mid works – search left
            else
                low = mid + 1;       // mid too small
        }
        return low;
    }

private:
    bool canRepair(const vector<int>& ranks, int cars, long long time) {
        long long total = 0;
        for (int r : ranks) {
            total += static_cast<long long>(sqrt((double)time / r));
            if (total >= cars) return true;   // early exit
        }
        return total >= cars;
    }
};
```

> **Why the sqrt?**  
> The condition `r * n² ≤ t` rearranges to `n ≤ sqrt(t / r)`.  
> Taking the floor gives the maximum integer `n` that can be repaired by that mechanic within time `t`.

## 4. Blog Article – “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of *Minimum Time to Repair Cars*”

### 4.1 Introduction  

If you’re preparing for a software‑engineering interview, you’ll find *Minimum Time to Repair Cars* (LeetCode 2594) on many lists. It’s a medium‑difficulty problem that tests your ability to:

- Recognize a **monotonic feasibility** problem.  
- Apply **binary search** on an answer space.  
- Work with **integer math** and avoid overflow.  

In this article we dissect the problem, walk through a clean solution, discuss pitfalls, and share SEO‑friendly keywords that will help your blog rank for interview‑prep queries.

### 4.2 Problem Understanding  

A mechanic’s speed is governed by a quadratic cost: `time = rank × n²`.  
- Rank = 1 is the fastest, rank = 100 is the slowest.  
- `n` is the number of cars a single mechanic repairs.  

All mechanics operate **in parallel**.  The question: **what is the minimal total time to finish `cars` cars?**

The naive approach would simulate each mechanic adding cars one by one. That would be `O(ranks × cars)`, far too slow for `cars = 10⁶`.

---

### 4.3 Naïve vs. Optimal Approaches  

| Approach | Complexity | Practicality |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Brute‑force simulation | `O(m × cars)` | Fails at high constraints |
| **Binary Search on Time** | `O(m log(max_time))` | Fast, clean, fits limits |
| Greedy scheduling | Incorrect – the quadratic cost breaks simple greedy |

The binary search method is a textbook “search the answer” pattern: **find the smallest time that satisfies a feasibility condition**.

---

### 4.4 Feasibility Check  

Given a candidate time `t`:

```
for each mechanic with rank r:
    maxCars = floor( sqrt(t / r) )
    total += maxCars
return total >= cars
```

Why `sqrt`?  
`r × n² ≤ t` ⇔ `n² ≤ t / r` ⇔ `n ≤ sqrt(t / r)`.  
We take the floor because `n` must be an integer.

---

### 4.5 Choosing the Search Bounds  

- **Lower bound (`low`)**: 0 minutes – always too small.  
- **Upper bound (`high`)**:  
  The fastest mechanic alone would need `minRank × cars²` minutes.  
  No schedule can be worse than that, so it is a safe upper limit.

With 64‑bit integers (Java `long`, Python `int`, C++ `long long`) there’s no overflow risk.

---

### 4.6 Time & Space Complexity  

- **Time**: `O(m log(minRank × cars²))`.  
  *For the maximum values this is about 30 iterations × 10⁵ mechanics = 3 million operations.*  
- **Space**: `O(1)` – only a few counters and indices.

---

### 4.7 Edge‑Case Gotchas  

1. **Overflow** – use 64‑bit arithmetic for `t = r × n²`.  
2. **Floating‑point sqrt** – use integer square root (`Math.isqrt` in Python, `sqrt` cast to long in Java/C++).  
3. **Early termination** – as soon as the cumulative cars reach the target, stop summing to save time.  
4. **Zero‑time corner case** – `low` starts at 0; the first feasible time is always ≥ 1.

---

### 4.8 Why This Solution Stands Out  

- **Simplicity**: A few lines of code, no extra data structures.  
- **Scalability**: Handles the largest input sizes comfortably.  
- **Generalizability**: The same binary‑search framework applies to many interview problems with “find minimum/maximum feasible answer” constraints (e.g., *Minimum Number of Jumps*, *Binary Search in a Sorted Matrix*).
