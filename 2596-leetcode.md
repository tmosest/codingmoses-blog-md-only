        # 2596. Check Knight Tour Configuration  
**A full‑stack solution (Java / Python / C++) + a “good‑bad‑ugly” blog post**  

---

## 1. The Problem (in a nutshell)

You are given an `n × n` chessboard (`3 ≤ n ≤ 7`).  
The board is filled with **distinct** integers from `0` to `n²‑1`.  
`grid[row][col]` tells you *when* the knight landed on that square –  
`0` means the very first move (starting point), `1` the second, and so on.

**Goal**: Verify that the sequence of positions is a *valid knight tour* – i.e. the knight can travel from the square marked `0` to the square marked `1`, then to `2`, …, all the way to `n²‑1` using only legal knight moves.

A legal knight move is one of the 8 L‑shapes:

```
(±2, ±1)   or   (±1, ±2)
```

Return `true` if the whole configuration is legal, otherwise `false`.

---

## 2. Straight‑forward O(n²) solution

The brute‑force way would be to simulate the tour, but we can do it in one pass:

1. **Store coordinates of every number**  
   `pos[v] = (row, col)` for `v` in `[0, n²‑1]`.

2. **Verify every consecutive pair**  
   For every `i` from `0` to `n²‑2` check whether  
   `abs(row[i] - row[i+1])` and `abs(col[i] - col[i+1])` are `(1,2)` or `(2,1)`.

3. If *any* pair fails, return `false`.  
   If the loop completes, return `true`.

Both time and space are `O(n²)` – we touch each cell a constant number of times.

## 3. Code

### 3.1 Java

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkValidGrid(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int size = n * n;

        // pos[i] = {row, col} of the i‑th step
        int[][] pos = new int[size][2];

        // Build the lookup table
        for (int r = 0; r < n; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < n; c++) {
                int val = grid[r][c];
                if (val < 0 || val >= size) return false;   // safety check
                pos[val][0] = r;
                pos[val][1] = c;
            }
        }

        // Validate each consecutive move
        for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; i++) {
            int[] a = pos[i];
            int[] b = pos[i + 1];
            int dr = Math.abs(a[0] - b[0]);
            int dc = Math.abs(a[1] - b[1]);

            if (!((dr == 2 && dc == 1) || (dr == 1 && dc == 2))) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def checkValidGrid(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        n = len(grid)
        size = n * n
        pos = [(0, 0)] * size

        # Build coordinate table
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(n):
                val = grid[r][c]
                if not (0 <= val < size):
                    return False
                pos[val] = (r, c)

        # Validate moves
        for i in range(size - 1):
            r1, c1 = pos[i]
            r2, c2 = pos[i + 1]
            dr, dc = abs(r1 - r2), abs(c1 - c2)
            if not ((dr == 2 and dc == 1) or (dr == 1 and dc == 2)):
                return False

        return True
```

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkValidGrid(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        int size = n * n;

        // pos[v] = {row, col}
        vector<pair<int, int>> pos(size);

        for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
            for (int c = 0; c < n; ++c) {
                int val = grid[r][c];
                if (val < 0 || val >= size) return false;
                pos[val] = {r, c};
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; ++i) {
            auto [r1, c1] = pos[i];
            auto [r2, c2] = pos[i + 1];
            int dr = abs(r1 - r2);
            int dc = abs(c1 - c2);
            if (!((dr == 2 && dc == 1) || (dr == 1 && dc == 2))) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

## 4. Why this solution shines

| Aspect | What we do | Why it matters |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Time** | `O(n²)` | Only two linear scans, optimal for `n ≤ 7`. |
| **Space** | `O(n²)` | Constant additional space per cell (two ints). |
| **Readability** | One‑liner knight‑check | Easy to audit and extend. |
| **Deterministic** | No recursion or backtracking | No stack overflows or exponential blow‑up. |
| **Portability** | Same logic in Java / Python / C++ | Helps you show cross‑platform chops. |

## 5. The “Good, Bad, Ugly” of this problem

### Good  
* **Concrete constraints** – Small board, distinct values, no ambiguities.  
* **Clear definition of a valid move** – A pair of `(2,1)` or `(1,2)`.  
* **Testable in minutes** – No hidden state, simple to unit‑test.  

### Bad  
* **Edge‑case paranoia** – Board must start at `(0,0)` with `0`, values must be unique.  
* **Misleading brute‑force solutions** – Some people try to simulate the tour, which is unnecessary.  
* **Sparse input format** – `grid[row][col]` might mislead you into thinking you need to search for `i` instead of building a lookup.  

### Ugly  
* **Over‑engineering** – Recursive backtracking or BFS that actually *searches* the path, but the path is already encoded.  
* **Incorrect handling of indices** – Using 1‑based logic on a 0‑based board can cause off‑by‑one bugs.  
* **Assuming `grid[0][0] == 0` automatically** – Some solutions ignore this essential condition.

### Introduction  
If you’re preparing for coding interviews, **LeetCode 2596** (“Check Knight Tour Configuration”) is a quick‑fire problem that tests your understanding of 2‑D arrays, index manipulation, and algorithmic efficiency. This post gives you:

1. A bullet‑proof `O(n²)` solution in **Java, Python, and C++**.  
2. A deep dive into the **good, bad, ugly** pitfalls.  
3. Why this problem is a *must‑have* on your interview toolkit.

### Problem Recap (Quick)  
Given an `n × n` board (`3 ≤ n ≤ 7`) filled with distinct integers `[0, n²‑1]`, each number indicates the visit order of a knight. Verify whether the knight’s moves between consecutive numbers are legal.

### Why a Simple Lookup Works  
The trick is **not** to *simulate* the knight’s moves; the board already tells you *where* the knight is at each step. By storing the coordinates of each number in an array, we can validate all 8 knight moves in a single linear scan.

*Time*: `O(n²)`  
*Space*: `O(n²)`

### Code Walk‑through  

*Java*  
- Build `pos` array.  
- Iterate `0 … n²-2` and validate `(dr, dc)`.

*Python*  
- Same idea, but leveraging tuples for brevity.

*C++*  
- Use `std::pair` and `auto` for readability.

(Full code snippets are above.)

### The Good, Bad, Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Constraints** | Small `n` → simple algorithms | – | – |
| **Edge cases** | Check `grid[0][0] == 0`, uniqueness | Overlooked | Failing tests |
| **Implementation** | One‑liner move check | Over‑complicated search | Wrong index handling |
| **Testing** | Unit tests on all permutations | – | – |

### Take‑away & Interview Tips  

1. **Read the problem carefully** – don’t assume the start is always `0`.  
2. **Think in terms of data structures** – a lookup table beats backtracking here.  
3. **Write clean, language‑idiomatic code** – show that you can adapt a logic to Java, Python, or C++.  
4. **Prepare edge‑case tests** – show you’re not just printing “true”.

### Closing Thoughts  

LeetCode 2596 may look simple, but it’s a hidden gem for interview prep. By mastering this problem, you demonstrate:

- *Algorithmic thinking*: O(n²) vs. exponential.  
- *Language flexibility*: Java, Python, C++ all covered.
