# Vertical Farming

Still at it with the verticle farming. The Pip boy and Niimbot printer are working great!

I talk to my pi and tell it "I planted x sub y" and it will create that species and subspecies in the database if needed by calling through to the server with the custom Wordpress Plugin Moses Grows.
It then generates a plant in the database using a random name table that has a few hundred names from things like Disney, LOTR, etc with their origin and description.

After adding everything to my databse it calls through and makes a printer call (different server) and I have a label ready! Now that's awesome!!!
The label is right next to me. Prints one for the stick for the photographer robot and the other one is for the card.

Next up little bot that can walk the tight rope and take photos of your moms bush... es... photos of George Bush I mean... idk...

1. Need to update the database to have a concept of rooms.
2. Need to update the database to have a concept of containers.
3. Then a robot can be assigned to a room or set of containers and it will perform something like A* until it finds all the plants and has a daily photo.
4. Another robot will be able to read the basic information about the soil levels for the container and have a water pump deliver water if needed.

# Warp Tour Terminal

I now hate you a little Warp Terminal... I don't want to have to pay and I need an AI agent so I can eat, sleep and let my dog poop...
I am a hot chick I don't poop... lol... jk...

But this is another project to see how well I can make an AI termianl here soon...

There is a repo for make everything or make anything that has a really basic terminal tutorial and that is where I will probably start.
This will probably be a bit though...

# Raspberry PI Zero Case... and RC Crane!!!

- [Zero pi case wearable...](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1649799)
- [Crane](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2814042)
- [Winner!!!!](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2055788)

Ok the crane just looks amazing! For now all I need is pi case probably... but the crane with the pi on it is the ultimate winner for this!!!

Damn you different HDMI cable sizes! lol... we were happy with just HDMI... now we got mini and micro... wheres that new chinese thing?

# Octoprint... 

Well figured out part of the issue is that Swiss Micro Hot End was enabled and this printer doesn't have that.

Also the nozzle was clogged and needed to be heated up and then unclogged.

# Pip Boy

Now has a working screen and will soon have a case as well... which begin here soon.
