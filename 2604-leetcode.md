## Problem Recap
> **LeetCode 2604 – Minimum Time to Eat All Grains**  
> There are `n` hens and `m` grains positioned on a line (0 ≤ position ≤ 10⁹).  
> A hen can eat a grain instantly when it is on the same position.  
> In one second a hen can move one unit left or right; all hens move independently and simultaneously.  
> Return the *minimum* number of seconds required for the hens to eat **all** grains.

*Example*

```
hens   = [3,6,7]
grains = [2,4,7,9]
answer = 2
```

## Intuition & High‑Level Idea

1. **Binary Search on the answer**  
   The time required is an integer between `0` and `1.5 × 10⁹`.  
   If a given time `T` is enough for all hens to finish, any larger time will also be enough.  
   Therefore we can binary‑search the smallest feasible `T`.

2. **Greedy feasibility check**  
   For a fixed `T`, assign grains to hens greedily from left to right:  
   *A hen can cover a continuous interval `[L, R]` in `T` seconds.*  
   - If the nearest uncovered grain lies to the **left** of the hen, the hen must reach that grain first; the rest of the time can be used to move right.  
   - If there’s no left grain, the hen can only move right.  

   We compute the furthest grain the current hen can eat (`R`) and skip all grains within `[L, R]`. Repeat until all grains are covered or we run out of hens.

The greedy check is `O(n + m)` after sorting, and the binary search adds a `log` factor.

## The Good  
| Aspect | Why It’s Great |
|--------|----------------|
| **Time Efficiency** | `O((n+m) log M)` with `M ≤ 1.5 × 10⁹`. Handles 20 k hens/grains comfortably. |
| **Space Efficiency** | Only `O(1)` auxiliary space (apart from input arrays). |
| **Deterministic** | No randomization or probabilistic steps – perfect for interview rigor. |
| **Scalable** | The algorithm works for larger constraints if needed (just increase `M`). |
| **Language‑agnostic** | Clean implementation in Java, Python, and C++. |

---

## The Bad  
| Aspect | Caveat |
|--------|--------|
| **Binary Search Bound** | Setting an upper bound of `1.5 × 10⁹` is derived from worst‑case positions; forgetting to use it could lead to an infinite loop. |
| **Int Overflow** | In Java or C++ we must use `long`/`long long` for intermediate sums (`hen + T`, `hen + T/2`). |
| **Sorting Cost** | Although `O((n+m) log (n+m))` is acceptable, for extremely large inputs it dominates. |

---

## The Ugly  
| Issue | Work‑around |
|-------|--------------|
| **Edge Cases with Huge Distances** | The greedy formula `henRight = Math.max(henLeft + timeLeft, hens[h] + timeLeft / 2)` can be confusing; a wrong derivation leads to bugs. |
| **Negative TimeLeft** | When a grain is too far left, `timeLeft` becomes negative – we must immediately return `false`. |
| **Non‑intuitive Movement** | The hen may need to first go right, then left, which feels counter‑intuitive but is handled correctly by the formula. |
| **Python Performance** | Using lists with `while` loops is fine, but using `bisect` can also work. Keep the code simple for readability. |

## Complete Implementations

### 1. Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int minimumTime(int[] hens, int[] grains) {
        Arrays.sort(hens);
        Arrays.sort(grains);

        int low = 0, high = 1_500_000_000;  // safe upper bound
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (canFinishInTime(hens, grains, mid)) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }

    private boolean canFinishInTime(int[] hens, int[] grains, int time) {
        int h = 0, g = 0;
        int n = hens.length, m = grains.length;

        while (h < n && g < m) {
            int henPos = hens[h];
            int leftBound, rightBound;

            if (grains[g] < henPos) {            // grain on the left
                int distToLeft = henPos - grains[g];
                int remaining = time - distToLeft;
                if (remaining < 0) return false;

                leftBound = grains[g];
                // Two ways: go left first, or right first then back
                rightBound = Math.max(leftBound + remaining,
                                      henPos + remaining / 2);
            } else {                              // no left grain
                leftBound = henPos;
                rightBound = henPos + time;
            }

            // Consume all grains inside [leftBound, rightBound]
            while (g < m && grains[g] >= leftBound && grains[g] <= rightBound) {
                g++;
            }
            h++;
        }
        return g == m;
    }
}
```

### 2. Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumTime(self, hens: List[int], grains: List[int]) -> int:
        hens.sort()
        grains.sort()

        low, high = 0, 1_500_000_000
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if self._can_finish(hens, grains, mid):
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        return low

    def _can_finish(self, hens: List[int], grains: List[int], time: int) -> bool:
        h = g = 0
        n, m = len(hens), len(grains)

        while h < n and g < m:
            hen = hens[h]
            if grains[g] < hen:                     # grain on the left
                dist_left = hen - grains[g]
                remaining = time - dist_left
                if remaining < 0:
                    return False
                left = grains[g]
                right = max(left + remaining,
                            hen + remaining // 2)
            else:                                   # no left grain
                left = hen
                right = hen + time

            while g < m and left <= grains[g] <= right:
                g += 1
            h += 1

        return g == m
```

### 3. C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTime(vector<int>& hens, vector<int>& grains) {
        sort(hens.begin(), hens.end());
        sort(grains.begin(), grains.end());

        long long low = 0, high = 1500000000LL;
        while (low <= high) {
            long long mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (canFinish(hens, grains, mid)) high = mid - 1;
            else low = mid + 1;
        }
        return (int)low;
    }

private:
    bool canFinish(const vector<int>& hens,
                   const vector<int>& grains,
                   long long time) {
        int h = 0, g = 0;
        int n = hens.size(), m = grains.size();

        while (h < n && g < m) {
            long long henPos = hens[h];
            long long left, right;

            if (grains[g] < henPos) {               // grain to the left
                long long distLeft = henPos - grains[g];
                long long remaining = time - distLeft;
                if (remaining < 0) return false;

                left = grains[g];
                right = max(left + remaining,
                            henPos + remaining / 2);
            } else {                                 // no left grain
                left = henPos;
                right = henPos + time;
            }

            while (g < m && grains[g] >= left && grains[g] <= right)
                ++g;
            ++h;
        }
        return g == m;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Sorting hens & grains | `O((n+m) log (n+m))` | `O(1)` |
| Binary search (≤ 31 iterations) | `O(log M)` (`M` upper bound) | `O(1)` |
| Greedy feasibility check | `O(n+m)` | `O(1)` |
| **Total** | `O((n+m) log M)` | `O(1)` |

With `n, m ≤ 20 000`, the runtime is well below one second in all three languages.

## Why This Matters for Your Job Hunt

- **Interview Gold‑Standard**: Binary search + greedy checks are classic patterns that hiring managers love.  
- **Cross‑Language Fluency**: Knowing how to port the solution to Java, Python, or C++ shows you can think algorithmically *independent of syntax*.  
- **Handling Large Inputs**: Demonstrating awareness of overflow and bound selection proves you care about edge cases—a must‑have in production code.  
- **Talk‑through Ability**: Explaining the *why* behind the greedy bound (e.g., moving right first then left) shows deep understanding, which interviewers value highly.  

If you can articulate this solution clearly in an interview, you’ll stand out as a candidate who blends theoretical rigor with practical coding skills.
