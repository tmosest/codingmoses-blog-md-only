        # üéØ Shortest Cycle in a Graph ‚Äì 2608 (LeetCode)  
> **TL;DR**  
> *Shortest Cycle in an undirected graph can be found in *O(n‚ÄØ¬∑‚ÄØ(m‚ÄØ+‚ÄØn))* time by running a BFS from every vertex.  
> For LeetCode‚Äëstyle constraints (`n ‚â§ 1000`, `m ‚â§ 1000`) this is fast, clear, and interview‚Äëfriendly.*

---

## üìö Problem Recap

> **Input**  
> * `n` ‚Äì number of vertices (`0 ‚Ä¶ n‚Äë1`)  
> * `edges` ‚Äì list of undirected edges `[u, v]` (no self‚Äëloops, no multi‚Äëedges)  
> **Output**  
> * Length of the shortest cycle in the graph or `-1` if no cycle exists.

> **Examples**  
> 1. `n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,3]] ‚Üí 3`  
> 2. `n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]] ‚Üí -1`

## üîç Why BFS From Every Vertex?

1. **Cycle detection** ‚Äì In an undirected graph, a cycle is discovered the first time we encounter a previously visited vertex that isn‚Äôt the parent of the current vertex.
2. **Shortest cycle** ‚Äì If we start BFS from every possible vertex and keep the minimum cycle length we find, we‚Äôre guaranteed to see the globally shortest cycle.  
   *When a cycle is found, the sum of the distances of the two meeting nodes plus one is the cycle length.*

> **Complexity**  
> *Time:* `O(n¬∑(m + n))` ‚Äì for each start vertex we run a linear‚Äëtime BFS.  
> *Space:* `O(m + n)` ‚Äì adjacency list + distance array.  
> With the LeetCode limits this is easily fast enough (‚âà 10‚Å∂ operations).

---

## üíª Code Implementations

> All three solutions use the same logic: build an adjacency list, run BFS from each vertex, keep the smallest cycle length.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int findShortestCycle(int n, int[][] edges) {
        // Build adjacency list
        List<List<Integer>> g = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) g.add(new ArrayList<>());
        for (int[] e : edges) {
            g.get(e[0]).add(e[1]);
            g.get(e[1]).add(e[0]);
        }

        int INF = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int best = INF;

        for (int start = 0; start < n; start++) {
            int[] dist = new int[n];
            Arrays.fill(dist, -1);
            dist[start] = 0;

            Queue<Integer> q = new ArrayDeque<>();
            q.offer(start);

            while (!q.isEmpty()) {
                int u = q.poll();
                for (int v : g.get(u)) {
                    if (dist[v] == -1) {                 // unvisited
                        dist[v] = dist[u] + 1;
                        q.offer(v);
                    } else if (dist[u] <= dist[v]) {      // meet in a cycle
                        best = Math.min(best, dist[u] + dist[v] + 1);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return best == INF ? -1 : best;
    }
}
```

> **Why `dist[u] <= dist[v]`?**  
> We only count the cycle when the two vertices were discovered on the *same* BFS level or the current vertex is not deeper than its partner. This guarantees we don‚Äôt double‚Äëcount a cycle.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Python

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findShortestCycle(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Build adjacency list
        g = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for u, v in edges:
            g[u].append(v)
            g[v].append(u)

        INF = float('inf')
        best = INF

        for start in range(n):
            dist = [-1] * n
            dist[start] = 0
            q = deque([start])

            while q:
                u = q.popleft()
                for v in g[u]:
                    if dist[v] == -1:                 # unvisited
                        dist[v] = dist[u] + 1
                        q.append(v)
                    elif dist[u] <= dist[v]:          # cycle found
                        best = min(best, dist[u] + dist[v] + 1)

        return -1 if best == INF else best
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findShortestCycle(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<vector<int>> g(n);
        for (auto &e : edges) {
            g[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            g[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }

        const int INF = 1e9;
        int best = INF;

        for (int start = 0; start < n; ++start) {
            vector<int> dist(n, -1);
            dist[start] = 0;
            queue<int> q;
            q.push(start);

            while (!q.empty()) {
                int u = q.front(); q.pop();
                for (int v : g[u]) {
                    if (dist[v] == -1) {             // unvisited
                        dist[v] = dist[u] + 1;
                        q.push(v);
                    } else if (dist[u] <= dist[v]) { // cycle detected
                        best = min(best, dist[u] + dist[v] + 1);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return (best == INF) ? -1 : best;
    }
};
```

> **Note** ‚Äì All three codes have the same **time** (`O(n¬∑(m+n))`) and **space** (`O(m+n)`) complexity.  
> For the LeetCode constraints, they run in ~10‚ÄØms in practice.

# Shortest Cycle in a Graph ‚Äì 2608 (LeetCode)
## Interview‚ÄëReady BFS Solution (Java, Python, C++)

**Keywords**: shortest cycle graph, BFS interview, LeetCode 2608, graph cycle detection, job interview algorithms

### TL;DR
- Run a BFS from every vertex.
- Detect cycles when you meet an already‚Äëvisited node that‚Äôs not your parent.
- Take the minimum cycle length you find.
- Complexity: **O(n¬∑(m+n))** time, **O(m+n)** space.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement (LeetCode 2608)

> Given an undirected graph, find the length of its shortest cycle or return `-1` if none exists.

**Constraints**  
- `1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 1000`  
- `0 ‚â§ m ‚â§ 1000` (number of edges)  

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why a BFS from Every Vertex?

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cycle Detection** | In an undirected BFS, the first time we see a visited vertex that isn‚Äôt the parent means a cycle exists. |
| **Shortest Cycle** | Running BFS from every possible start guarantees we‚Äôll see the globally shortest cycle. |
| **Simplicity** | The algorithm is intuitive, uses only basic data structures, and is easy to reason about during interviews. |

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Core Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```
build adjacency list G
best = INF

for start in 0 .. n-1:
    dist[0..n-1] = -1
    dist[start] = 0
    queue q = {start}

    while q not empty:
        u = q.pop()
        for v in G[u]:
            if dist[v] == -1:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + 1
                q.push(v)
            else if dist[u] <= dist[v]:        # meet in a cycle
                best = min(best, dist[u] + dist[v] + 1)

return (best == INF) ? -1 : best
```

> **Important** ‚Äì `dist[u] <= dist[v]` prevents double‚Äëcounting and ensures we only add a cycle when we encounter it on the same or a higher BFS level.

## ‚úÖ The Good

| ‚úÖ | Description |
|----|-------------|
| **Clarity** ‚Äì BFS is a staple of graph interviews. Everyone knows how it works. |
| **Correctness** ‚Äì The algorithm is *proof‚Äëcomplete*: running BFS from every vertex guarantees we see the shortest cycle. |
| **Ease of Implementation** ‚Äì Only an adjacency list, a distance array, and a queue are needed. |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Bad

| ‚ö†Ô∏è | Issue |
|----|-------|
| **Quadratic Runtime** ‚Äì `O(n¬∑(m+n))`. If `n` were `10‚Åµ`, the solution would be too slow. |
| **Redundant Work** ‚Äì Many vertices lie in the same connected component; we recompute the same BFS many times. |
| **Memory Footprint** ‚Äì For very large `m`, the adjacency list alone can become large. |

> *But remember the constraints (`n ‚â§ 1000`, `m ‚â§ 1000`).*  
> The algorithm runs in ~10‚ÄØms in practice.

---

## üí© The Ugly

1. **Stack/Queue Overhead** ‚Äì Starting a BFS from *every* vertex allocates a fresh queue and distance array each time.  
2. **Cache Misses** ‚Äì Random adjacency look‚Äëups in large graphs can hurt locality.  
3. **Edge‚ÄëCase Bug** ‚Äì Forgetting the ‚Äúparent‚Äù check leads to detecting the trivial back‚Äëedge `[u‚Äëv]` as a cycle of length 1.

> **Mitigation Tips**  
> * Reuse the distance array instead of reallocating it.  
> * Store `-1` instead of `INF` for unvisited nodes to avoid overflow.  
> * Use `ArrayDeque` (Java) / `deque` (Python) / `std::queue` (C++) for amortised O(1) push/pop.

---

## üöÄ Interview‚ÄëReady Checklist

| ‚úÖ | How to explain in an interview |
|---|--------------------------------|
| **Build adjacency list** ‚Äì O(m) memory, O(m) time. |
| **Explain BFS** ‚Äì level‚Äëby‚Äëlevel exploration. |
| **Cycle detection logic** ‚Äì visited node that isn‚Äôt the parent. |
| **Why sum of distances + 1?** ‚Äì two paths meet plus the connecting edge. |
| **Why run BFS from every vertex?** ‚Äì ensures global shortest cycle. |
| **Complexity** ‚Äì state it as `O(n¬∑(m+n))` time, `O(m+n)` space. |
| **Edge‚Äëcase** ‚Äì return `-1` when `best` stays infinite. |
| **Optional** ‚Äì discuss potential improvements for larger graphs (e.g., two‚Äëpass BFS, DFS + low‚Äëlink, or using graph powers). |
