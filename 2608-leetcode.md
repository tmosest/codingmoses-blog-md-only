## 2. Why this problem is a *gold‚Äëmine* for interviews

| ‚úÖ  | Reason |
|-----|--------|
| üîç  | It forces you to think about graph traversal, distance tracking, and cycle detection in one sweep. |
| üí¨  | Discussable ‚Äì DFS vs. BFS, time/space trade‚Äëoffs, graph representations. |
| üéØ  | Solvable in O(n¬∑(n+m)) with simple BFS ‚Äì perfect for a 5‚Äëminute coding interview. |
| üìö  | You can showcase your mastery of BFS, queues, and clean code patterns. |

## 3. The ‚ÄúGood‚Äù ‚Äì A clean, BFS‚Äëbased solution

### 3.1 Intuition

1. **Root the BFS at every vertex**.  
2. Keep two arrays:  
   * `dist[v]` ‚Äì distance from the root to `v`.  
   * `parent[v]` ‚Äì the node from which we first discovered `v`.  
3. While exploring an edge `u ‚Äì v`:  
   * If `v` is unvisited ‚Üí set its distance and parent.  
   * If `v` is already visited **and** `parent[u] != v` ‚Üí a cycle is detected.  
     The cycle length is `dist[u] + dist[v] + 1`.  

Because BFS explores vertices in increasing distance from the root, the first time we find a non‚Äëparent neighbor we‚Äôre guaranteed to have the *shortest* cycle that passes through the root. Repeating for all roots gives the global minimum.

### 3.2 Complexity

| | Time | Space |
|---|------|-------|
| For a single BFS | `O(n + m)` | `O(n)` |
| For all roots | `O(n ¬∑ (n + m))` | `O(n)` (reused per BFS) |

With `n, m ‚â§ 1000`, this is comfortably fast.

## 4. The ‚ÄúBad‚Äù ‚Äì Common pitfalls

| ‚ö†Ô∏è | Pitfall | Fix |
|----|----------|-----|
| **Infinite loop** | Forget to mark visited nodes before enqueueing. | Use a `dist` array initialized to `-1` and check before enqueue. |
| **Wrong cycle length** | Mixing up the parent check (`dist[u] <= dist[v]` vs `parent[u] != v`). | Explicitly compare parents; or, if using only `dist`, keep the invariant `dist[u] <= dist[v]` when a cycle is found. |
| **TLE** | Using a na√Øve adjacency matrix for `n=1000`. | Use adjacency lists. |
| **Incorrect handling of disconnected components** | Skipping nodes that are never reached from the chosen root. | Iterate over **all** nodes as roots. |

---

## 5. The ‚ÄúUgly‚Äù ‚Äì When you go overboard

- Mixing DFS and BFS code in the same function ‚Äì leads to hard‚Äëto‚Äëread logic.  
- Using recursion for BFS (queue stored in a list) ‚Äì can be confusing.  
- Hard‚Äëcoding ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù as a magic number (`1e9`) instead of a clear constant.  
- Writing separate helper classes for the three languages without a single shared design pattern.  

*Lesson:* Keep the implementation *simple* and *documented*. A clean queue‚Äëbased BFS is the most maintainable solution.

## 6. Reference Implementations  

Below you‚Äôll find **three** fully‚Äëcommented solutions.  
All three follow the same BFS strategy, just adapted to Java, Python, and C++ idioms.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    // Infinity sentinel ‚Äì larger than any possible cycle length
    private static final int INF = 1_000_000_000;

    public int findShortestCycle(int n, int[][] edges) {
        // Build adjacency list
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        for (int[] e : edges) {
            graph.get(e[0]).add(e[1]);
            graph.get(e[1]).add(e[0]);
        }

        int best = INF;

        // Run BFS from every vertex as the root
        for (int root = 0; root < n; ++root) {
            best = Math.min(best, bfs(root, graph, n));
        }

        return best == INF ? -1 : best;
    }

    /** BFS from root, returns shortest cycle that passes through root, or INF if none. */
    private int bfs(int root, List<List<Integer>> graph, int n) {
        int[] dist = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(dist, -1);          // -1 ‚Üí unvisited
        Queue<Integer> q = new ArrayDeque<>();
        q.offer(root);
        dist[root] = 0;

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int u = q.poll();
            for (int v : graph.get(u)) {
                if (dist[v] == -1) {          // first time visiting v
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + 1;
                    q.offer(v);
                } else if (dist[u] <= dist[v]) {   // visited and not parent
                    // We found a cycle: u ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí v ‚Üí u
                    return dist[u] + dist[v] + 1;
                }

class Solution:
    INF = 10 ** 9

    def findShortestCycle(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # adjacency list
        g = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for u, v in edges:
            g[u].append(v)
            g[v].append(u)

        best = self.INF

        for root in range(n):
            best = min(best, self._bfs(root, g, n))

        return -1 if best == self.INF else best

    def _bfs(self, root: int, g: List[List[int]], n: int) -> int:
        dist = [-1] * n
        q = deque([root])
        dist[root] = 0

        while q:
            u = q.popleft()
            for v in g[u]:
                if dist[v] == -1:                     # first visit
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + 1
                    q.append(v)
                elif dist[u] <= dist[v]:              # visited & not parent
                    return dist[u] + dist[v] + 1
        return self.INF

public:

## ‚úÖ The Good ‚Äì A **BFS** Solution that Everyone Loves

The BFS approach is the cleanest way to detect cycles while simultaneously computing shortest paths.  

1. **Root the search** at every vertex (`0 ‚Ä¶ n-1`).  
2. **Track** `dist[]` (distance from the root) and implicitly the parent via the BFS order.  
3. **Detect** a cycle when you encounter an already‚Äëvisited node that is *not* the parent.  
4. **Compute** the cycle length as `dist[u] + dist[v] + 1`.

```java
// Java snippet (see section 6.1 above)
```

```python
# Python snippet (see section 6.2 above)
```

```cpp
// C++ snippet (see section 6.3 above)
```

**Time**: `O(n¬∑(n + m))` ‚Äì fast enough for `n, m ‚â§ 1000`.  
**Space**: `O(n)` ‚Äì distance array reused for each BFS.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Bad ‚Äì What to Avoid

| Pitfall | Why It Breaks | Quick Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Not marking nodes visited before pushing to queue | BFS gets stuck in infinite loops | `dist[v] == -1` check |
| Using a parent array that gets overwritten | Wrong cycle length (parent vs. distance check) | Compare parents explicitly |
| Adjacency matrix for 1000 nodes | Memory blow‚Äëup | Use adjacency lists |
| Skipping disconnected components | Missed cycles in separate components | Iterate all vertices as roots |

---

## üò± The Ugly ‚Äì Over‚Äëengineering That Spoils Readability

- Mixing DFS & BFS logic in one method.  
- Writing recursive BFS that uses a list as a queue.  
- Hard‚Äëcoding ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù values instead of named constants.  
- Adding unrelated helper classes that clutter the repository.

> **Pro Tip:** Keep your code *single‚Äëpurpose* and *self‚Äëdocumented*.  

---

## üéØ How to Use This in Your Next Interview

1. **Start with a quick sketch** of the BFS idea.  
2. **Show your code** in a language you‚Äôre comfortable with.  
3. **Discuss** edge cases (disconnected components, no cycles).  
4. **Compare** BFS vs. DFS ‚Äì highlight BFS‚Äôs guarantee of the shortest cycle.  
5. **Mention** possible optimisations (bidirectional BFS, early exit) ‚Äì even if you don‚Äôt implement them.

## üì£ Final Thought

The *Shortest Cycle* problem is a *show‚Äëcase* for your graph‚Äëalgorithm chops.  
A clean BFS solution like the one above demonstrates:

- **Understanding of data structures** (adjacency lists, queues).  
- **Algorithmic thinking** ‚Äì distance tracking + parent checks.  
- **Coding style** ‚Äì clear constants, modular helper functions.

Add the snippet to your GitHub, commit it to a ‚ÄúGraph Algorithms‚Äù folder, and include a comment explaining the approach. Recruiters love seeing not just a working solution, but also the *why* behind your choices.
