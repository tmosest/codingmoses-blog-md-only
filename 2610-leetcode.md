        ## 1. Code – Three Languages

Below are clean, production‑ready solutions for LeetCode 2610  
`Convert an Array Into a 2D Array With Conditions`.  
All three solutions run in **O(n)** time and use **O(n)** auxiliary space.

> **Key Insight**  
> If a number appears `k` times in `nums`, it has to occupy `k` *different* rows.  
> Therefore, the **maximum frequency** of any element is exactly the minimum
> number of rows the resulting matrix must contain.

| Language | Time | Space | Why it’s good |
|----------|------|-------|----------------|
| **Java** | O(n) | O(n) | Uses a `HashMap` for counting and a list of lists for the result. |
| **Python** | O(n) | O(n) | Leverages `collections.Counter` and list‑of‑lists. |
| **C++** | O(n) | O(n) | Uses `unordered_map` and a `vector<vector<int>>`. |

> The code below implements the *frequency‑based* algorithm described in the
> official editorial.  
> It is easier to understand, requires no extra libraries, and guarantees the
> minimal number of rows.

### 1.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findMatrix(int[] nums) {
        // 1. Count frequencies
        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        int maxFreq = 0;
        for (int x : nums) {
            int f = freq.getOrDefault(x, 0) + 1;
            freq.put(x, f);
            if (f > maxFreq) maxFreq = f;
        }

        // 2. Prepare empty rows (min number of rows = maxFreq)
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < maxFreq; i++) result.add(new ArrayList<>());

        // 3. Distribute numbers into rows
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : freq.entrySet()) {
            int val = entry.getKey(), cnt = entry.getValue();
            for (int i = 0; i < cnt; i++) {
                result.get(i).add(val);          // put into the i‑th row
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

### 1.2 Python

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findMatrix(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # 1. Frequency count
        freq = Counter(nums)
        max_freq = max(freq.values())

        # 2. Create empty rows
        result = [[] for _ in range(max_freq)]

        # 3. Fill rows – each number occupies distinct rows
        for val, cnt in freq.items():
            for i in range(cnt):
                result[i].append(val)

        return result
```

### 1.3 C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> findMatrix(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // 1. Count frequencies
        std::unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        int maxFreq = 0;
        for (int x : nums) {
            int f = ++freq[x];
            maxFreq = std::max(maxFreq, f);
        }

        // 2. Prepare result with 'maxFreq' rows
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> res(maxFreq);

        // 3. Distribute each value across rows
        for (auto &p : freq) {
            int val = p.first, cnt = p.second;
            for (int i = 0; i < cnt; ++i)
                res[i].push_back(val);          // put into i‑th row
        }

        return res;
    }
};

### Introduction

You’ve just solved **LeetCode 2610 – Convert an Array Into a 2D Array With Conditions**.  
The problem sounds deceptively simple: “Put numbers in rows, no duplicates per row.”  
But the real challenge is to do it *efficiently* and *with minimal rows*.  
In this article, I’ll walk you through the *good* (why the problem is great), the *bad* (common pitfalls), and the *ugly* (why naïve approaches fail), plus the clean, production‑ready solution that’s job‑interview ready.

---

### The Good – Why It Matters

| Why It’s Good | Interview Takeaway |
|---------------|--------------------|
| **Conceptual Clarity** – It forces you to think about *frequency* vs. *row count*. | Talk about how “frequency = number of times an element must appear in distinct rows” – demonstrates insight. |
| **Scalable Solution** – O(n) time, O(n) space. | Interviewers love solutions that scale; you can easily explain the algorithmic complexity. |
| **Real‑World Analogy** – Scheduling tasks across workers without conflicts. | Connect to real‑world systems like job schedulers, resource allocation. |
| **Language‑agnostic** – Easy to implement in Java, Python, C++. | Show that you can port the logic across languages – a strong signal of a well‑understood algorithm. |

---

### The Bad – Common Mistakes

1. **Treating it as a Sorting Problem**  
   - *Mistake*: Sort the array and then try to split it.  
   - *Why it fails*: Sorting does nothing to reduce the number of rows; you’ll still need `maxFrequency` rows.
2. **Over‑complicating with Nested Loops**  
   - *Mistake*: Double‑loop to add elements row by row, reducing counters inside.  
   - *Result*: O(n²) time – unacceptable for 200‑length arrays when interviews expect linear solutions.
3. **Ignoring the “Minimal Rows” Requirement**  
   - *Mistake*: Allocate as many rows as there are distinct elements.  
   - *Why it’s wrong*: You’re not using the *maximum frequency* as the true row limit.

---

### The Ugly – Why Naïve Distributions Crash

Consider a naïve implementation:

```text
for each row i:
    for each element j:
        if count[j] > 0:
            put element j into row i
            count[j]--
```

This works *in theory*, but the inner `for each element` loop runs over *all distinct elements* for every row, which leads to a complexity of `O(maxFreq * distinctElements)`.  
When `maxFreq` equals `n`, the worst case becomes `O(n²)`.  
In an interview setting, such a solution will trigger red flags: “Why did you write an O(n²) algorithm when the problem is trivial for O(n)?”

---

### The Ugly – Why You Should Avoid the `unordered_map`‑only Approach

Another tempting approach is to keep a simple `unordered_map` (or `Counter`) and, for each row, iterate over *all* keys, decrementing when you place a value.  
That yields a perfectly correct result but it still has `O(maxFreq * distinct)` complexity.  
In practice, you can hit the upper bound (n = 200) in milliseconds, but the interview panel wants **clear, linear‑time reasoning** – the clean frequency‑distribution trick beats it.

---

### The Clean Solution – Frequency‑Based Distribution

**Step 1 – Count frequencies**

```text
freq[value] = number of occurrences of value
maxFreq = maximum of all freq values
```

**Step 2 – Pre‑allocate rows**

```text
rows = [ [] for _ in range(maxFreq) ]   # minimal number of rows
```

**Step 3 – Distribute**

For each `(value, count)` pair, append the value to the first `count` rows:

```text
for i in 0 .. count-1:
    rows[i].append(value)
```

This guarantees:

- Every row contains no duplicate (each value only appears once per row).
- All numbers are used exactly `count` times.
- The number of rows equals `maxFreq` – the minimal possible.

**Complexity**

- **Time** – O(n) – each number is processed once for counting, then once for distribution.
- **Space** – O(n) – frequency map + result matrix.

### Why It’s Interview‑Ready

- **Linear Time** – Interviewers can immediately spot the O(n) nature and ask for a proof.
- **Simple Data Structures** – Only a map and a list of lists; no custom classes or helper functions needed.
- **Language‑agnostic Code** – All three languages above are ready‑to‑copy, making you look like a versatile engineer.
- **Edge‑Case Coverage** – Handles empty arrays, all‑identical arrays, and the maximum allowed size.
- **Test‑Driven** – You can run the sample tests (e.g., `[1,2,3,4,5,5,4,3,2,1]` → `[[1,2,3,4,5],[1,2,3,4,5]]`) instantly.

### How to Ace the Interview

1. **State the Problem Clearly** – “We need to place each element into distinct rows without intra‑row duplicates.”  
2. **Explain the Frequency‑Row Equivalence** – “The maximum frequency forces the minimal number of rows.”  
3. **Present the Algorithm Visually** – Show a quick diagram or pseudocode.  
4. **Analyze Complexity** – O(n) time, O(n) space.  
5. **Address Edge Cases** – Empty input, all unique, all same.  
6. **Show Multi‑Language Portability** – “Here’s how I’d do it in Java, Python, and C++.”

### Closing Thought

LeetCode 2610 is a textbook example of a problem that turns a *simple* statement into an *elegant* algorithmic lesson.  
Mastering it shows you can:

- Read a problem statement carefully,
- Spot the key mathematical property (frequency → rows),
- Deliver a linear‑time solution,
- Explain it across multiple languages.

If you’re preparing for software‑engineer interviews or looking to land that coveted job, remember: **the best solutions are often the ones that translate a subtle observation into a clean, linear algorithm.**  

Happy coding—and may your rows always be minimal!
