        # 2651‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØCalculate Delayed Arrival Time  
**LeetCode ID:**‚ÄØ2651 | **Difficulty:**‚ÄØEasy | **Category:**‚ÄØMath

> **Problem** ‚Äì Given an `arrivalTime` (0‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØarrivalTime‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ24) and a `delayedTime` (1‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØdelayedTime‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ24) in hours, return the hour (0‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØ23) at which the train will finally arrive.  
> **Time is expressed in 24‚Äëhour format**.

> **Example**  
> ```
> arrivalTime = 13, delayedTime = 11  ‚Üí  (13 + 11) % 24 = 0
> ```

The solution is a single arithmetic operation and is therefore O(1) in time and space.

| Language | Code | Complexity | Notes |
|----------|------|------------|-------|
| **Java** | [See below](#java) | O(1) time, O(1) space | Uses `% 24` for wrap‚Äëaround. |
| **Python** | [See below](#python) | O(1) time, O(1) space | Modulo works on integers. |
| **C++** | [See below](#cpp) | O(1) time, O(1) space | `int` arithmetic; no overflow risk. |

## 2Ô∏è‚É£  The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

| Aspect | What to Highlight | Common Pitfalls | How to Fix It |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Good** | ‚Ä¢ O(1) arithmetic ‚Üí fast in interview<br>‚Ä¢ No loops or data structures ‚Üí minimal code<br>‚Ä¢ Edge‚Äëcase handling (`24 ‚Üí 0`) shows understanding of modulo | | |
| **Bad** | ‚Ä¢ Problem may look trivial but can trip people who forget the wrap‚Äëaround<br>‚Ä¢ Over‚Äëengineering with loops or string formatting can lead to unnecessary bugs | ‚Ä¢ Writing `arrivalTime + delayedTime` and forgetting `% 24` | ‚Ä¢ Always use modulo or check if sum ‚â• 24. |
| **Ugly** | ‚Ä¢ Using `if` statements for every hour (0‚Äë23) is a code smell<br>‚Ä¢ Ignoring the constraint `delayedTime <= 24` leads to potential overflow in other languages (not a problem here) | ‚Ä¢ Code that prints the full time string (e.g., `"20:00"`) when only the hour is needed | ‚Ä¢ Stick to the problem spec: return an integer. |

## 3Ô∏è‚É£  Why This Problem Rocks for Interviews

1. **Mathematical Thinking** ‚Äì The core idea is to recognize that time ‚Äúwraps‚Äù after 24 hours. This tests a candidate‚Äôs ability to map a real‚Äëworld scenario to a simple arithmetic formula.

2. **Constant‚ÄëTime Brilliance** ‚Äì Interviewers love O(1) solutions because they demonstrate a clean, optimal thought process.

3. **Edge‚ÄëCase Awareness** ‚Äì The hidden trick is the wrap‚Äëaround; many candidates silently assume that 24‚Äëhour addition always stays <‚ÄØ24. A robust answer must explicitly handle the boundary.

4. **Cross‚ÄëLanguage Mastery** ‚Äì The same logic translates to Java, Python, and C++. Showing the same concise solution in multiple languages is a great resume booster.

### üìÑ Introduction

If you‚Äôre prepping for a software engineering interview, you‚Äôll soon encounter *LeetCode 2651 ‚Äì Calculate Delayed Arrival Time*. It‚Äôs a deceptively simple problem that tests your ability to reason about 24‚Äëhour time wrap‚Äëaround and your command of basic arithmetic in code. Below you‚Äôll find **clean, production‚Äëready solutions** in **Java, Python, and C++**, along with an interview‚Äëstyle analysis of the *good, the bad, and the ugly*.

---

### üîç Problem Recap

You‚Äôre given two integers:

| Variable | Range | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `arrivalTime` | 0‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØ23 | Hour a train arrives |
| `delayedTime` | 1‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØ24 | Extra hours of delay |

Return the hour (0‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØ23) when the train finally arrives. In 24‚Äëhour format, 24 is represented as `0`.

**Example**

```text
arrivalTime = 13, delayedTime = 11
Result = (13 + 11) % 24 = 0  // 00:00
```

---

### üìå Core Insight

The **only** operation needed is **addition followed by a modulo 24**. This ensures that any overflow beyond 23 wraps around to the start of the next day.

---

### üß© Solutions

#### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findDelayedArrivalTime(int arrivalTime, int delayedTime) {
        return (arrivalTime + delayedTime) % 24;
    }
}
```

#### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def findDelayedArrivalTime(self, arrivalTime: int, delayedTime: int) -> int:
        return (arrivalTime + delayedTime) % 24
```

#### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findDelayedArrivalTime(int arrivalTime, int delayedTime) {
        return (arrivalTime + delayedTime) % 24;
    }
};
```

All three solutions run in **O(1) time** and **O(1) space**.

---

### üèÜ The Good

- **Simplicity** ‚Äì One line of code plus a method wrapper.
- **Optimality** ‚Äì Constant time & space.
- **Clear reasoning** ‚Äì Easy to explain in an interview.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è The Bad

- **Common forget** ‚Äì Omitting the modulo leads to wrong answers for inputs like `arrivalTime = 20, delayedTime = 5`.
- **Over‚Äëengineering** ‚Äì Adding loops or string formatting bloats the solution.

### üî• The Ugly

- **Hard‚Äëcoded checks** ‚Äì Writing an `if` block for each hour is a maintenance nightmare.
- **Wrong return type** ‚Äì Returning `"20:00"` as a string when the spec requires an integer.

### üéØ Interview Tips

1. **State the edge case** ‚Äì ‚ÄúWe need to wrap around after 23, so we‚Äôll take the sum modulo 24.‚Äù
2. **Mention constraints** ‚Äì ‚ÄúBecause `delayedTime` ‚â§ 24, integer overflow isn‚Äôt an issue in these languages.‚Äù
3. **Show the solution** ‚Äì Write the single line and highlight its elegance.
4. **Ask clarifying questions** ‚Äì ‚ÄúDo we need to handle minutes? Should 24 be returned as 0?‚Äù

### üìö Takeaway

LeetCode 2651 is a classic ‚Äúmath‚Äëin‚Äëcode‚Äù problem that rewards clean, constant‚Äëtime solutions. By mastering this problem in **Java, Python, and C++**, you demonstrate:

- Cross‚Äëlanguage proficiency
