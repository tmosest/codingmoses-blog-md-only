## 1. The LeetCode Problem in a Nutshell

> **Goal**: Given a board of size *m × n* and a starting cell *(r, c)*, fill the board with the visit order (0‑based) of a knight that visits **every** cell exactly once.  
> **Constraints**: 1 ≤ *m, n* ≤ 5.  
> **Guarantee**: A tour exists for the test cases.

> **Sample**  
> Input: `m = 3, n = 4, r = 0, c = 0`  
> Output:  

```
[[0,3,6,9],
 [11,8,1,4],
 [2,5,10,7]]
```

## 2. The Algorithm – Backtracking + Warnsdorff’s Heuristic

Because the board is tiny, a plain DFS backtracking is enough.  
Still, to avoid needless work we use **Warnsdorff’s rule**: always try the next cell that has the fewest onward moves. This dramatically cuts the branching factor.

### Steps

1. **Define the 8 knight moves**  
   ```text
   (+2,+1), (+2,-1), (-2,+1), (-2,-1),
   (+1,+2), (+1,-2), (-1,+2), (-1,-2)
   ```

2. **DFS helper** `dfs(step, row, col)`  
   * Mark `board[row][col] = step`.  
   * If `step == m*n - 1` → tour finished → return `true`.  
   * Generate all legal next positions.  
   * Sort them by the number of legal moves from that position (Warnsdorff).  
   * Recurse on each.  
   * If a recursion fails → backtrack: reset `board[row][col] = -1`.

3. **Starter**  
   * Initialise `board` with `-1`.  
   * Call `dfs(0, r, c)`.  
   * Return the board (guaranteed to have a solution).

### Why It Works

- The search space is tiny (≤ 25 cells), so backtracking is fast.  
- Warnsdorff’s heuristic keeps the recursion depth shallow; most test cases finish in milliseconds.  
- The board guarantees a solution, so we stop at the first full tour we find.

### 3.1 Java (LeetCode Signature)

```java

### 3.2 Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    # 8 knight moves
    moves = [(2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),
             (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)]

    def tourOfKnight(self, m: int, n: int, r: int, c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        board = [[-1] * n for _ in range(m)]

        def dfs(step, x, y):
            board[x][y] = step
            if step == m * n - 1:
                return True

            # Generate next legal cells
            nxt = []
            for dx, dy in self.moves:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == -1:
                    nxt.append((nx, ny))

            # Warnsdorff ordering
            nxt.sort(key=lambda p: self._degree(p[0], p[1]))

            for nx, ny in nxt:
                if dfs(step + 1, nx, ny):
                    return True

            board[x][y] = -1  # backtrack
            return False

        def degree(x, y):
            cnt = 0
            for dx, dy in self.moves:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == -1:
                    cnt += 1
            return cnt

        self._degree = degree
        dfs(0, r, c)
        return board

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> tourOfKnight(int m, int n, int r, int c) {
        static const int dr[8] = { 2, 2,-2,-2, 1, 1,-1,-1};
        static const int dc[8] = { 1,-1, 1,-1, 2,-2, 2,-2};

        vector<vector<int>> board(m, vector<int>(n, -1));
        function<int(int,int)> dfs = [&](int step, int x, int y) -> int {

### 4.1 Introduction (≈ 150 words)

Knights are iconic in chess, and their L‑shaped moves have fascinated computer scientists for decades. When LeetCode turned this classic into **Problem 2664 – The Knight’s Tour**, it tested two vital skills: *recursive thinking* and *optimization tricks*.  
In this post we’ll:

* Break down the problem statement and constraints.  
* Present a clean backtracking solution with Warnsdorff’s heuristic.  
* Provide ready‑to‑copy code in **Java, Python, and C++**.  
* Discuss pitfalls (“the bad”) and edge‑case tricks (“the ugly”).  
* Finish with interview‑friendly talking points and SEO‑keywords to boost your résumé visibility.

Whether you’re prepping for a coding interview or simply love puzzles, this guide gives you everything you need to ace the Knight’s Tour.

---

### 4.2 Problem Deconstruction

- **Board size**: 1 ≤ *m, n* ≤ 5 → at most 25 cells.  
- **Start**: any cell (r, c).  
- **Goal**: label every cell with the visit order (0‑based).  
- **Guarantee**: a tour always exists for the test cases.

Because the board is tiny, brute‑force DFS is acceptable. The challenge lies in pruning the search efficiently.

---

### 4.3 The Good – Why Backtracking Works

- **Exhaustive search** guarantees finding a valid tour when one exists.  
- With **Warnsdorff’s rule**, the recursion depth shrinks dramatically: at each step we choose the cell that has the fewest onward moves, steering the search toward “bottleneck” areas first.  
- Implementation is straightforward, with only 8 constant‑size moves to consider.

---

### 4.4 The Bad – Why Naïve Backtracking Fails

- Without pruning, the worst‑case branching factor is 8⁽²⁵⁻¹⁾, still acceptable but slow.  
- If you ignore the “first‑cell‑visited‑once” rule, you’ll waste time exploring cycles that revisit the starting cell.  
- For boards larger than 5×5 (hypothetical extension), plain DFS would be infeasible.

---

### 4.5 The Ugly – Edge Cases & Common Pitfalls

| Problem | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Board 1×N or M×1** | DFS gets stuck because knights can’t move | Handle 1×1 separately; otherwise, the recursion will immediately return because there are no legal moves. |
| **Wrong degree calculation** | Wrong sorting → poor pruning, slower run | Ensure degree counts only *unvisited* cells. |
| **Mutable global state** | Accidental sharing between test cases | Reset the board and degree function per test call. |
| **Recursive stack overflow** | In languages with low recursion limits | Not a problem here (max depth 25) but good to be aware. |

---

### 4.6 Code Walk‑through (Java)

```java
private boolean dfs(int step, int r, int c) {
    board[r][c] = step;                 // mark visited
    if (step == m * n - 1) return true; // tour complete

    List<int[]> next = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {        // collect legal moves
        int nr = r + DR[i], nc = c + DC[i];
        if (valid(nr, nc) && board[nr][nc] == -1) next.add(new int[]{nr, nc});
    }

    next.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(p -> countMoves(p[0], p[1]))); // Warnsdorff

    for (int[] p : next) {
        if (dfs(step + 1, p[0], p[1])) return true;
    }

    board[r][c] = -1; // backtrack
    return false;
}
```

Key points:

1. **Base case** – immediately return when all cells are labeled.  
2. **Move collection** – constant‑time O(1).  
3. **Sorting** – `Comparator.comparingInt` uses degree; sorting a list of at most 8 elements is cheap.

---

### 4.7 Interview Talking Points

1. **Explain your recursion** – base case, marking, and backtracking.  
2. **Highlight Warnsdorff** – “I use the fewest‑degree heuristic to cut down the search space.”  
3. **Edge‑case handling** – “I handle 1×1 boards early to avoid dead‑ends.”  
4. **Time complexity** – O(8⁽²⁵⁻¹⁾) worst‑case, but practically < 1 ms due to pruning.  
5. **Space** – O(m × n) for the board, constant additional arrays.

---

### 4.8 Interview‑Friendly FAQ (≈ 50 words)

**Q:** *Is Warnsdorff’s rule a standard interview trick?*  
**A:** Yes—many interviewers value clever pruning. Explain that it’s a classic heuristic used for the open knight’s tour problem.

**Q:** *Can we solve this without recursion?*  
**A:** Iterative DFS or BFS is possible, but recursion makes the code cleaner and easier to explain.
