## üìñ Blog Post ‚Äì ‚ÄúMaximum OR (LeetCode 2680): The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly‚Äù

### 1. Introduction  

> **Problem Title**: *Maximum OR*  
> **LeetCode ID**: 2680  
> **Difficulty**: Medium  

You‚Äôre given an array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation you can double (multiply by 2) any element of the array. You can perform at most `k` operations. After all operations, you must return the maximum possible value of `nums[0] | nums[1] | ‚Ä¶ | nums[n‚Äë1]`.  

> *Why is this interview‚Äëfriendly?*  
> It tests bit manipulation, greedy reasoning, and an understanding of how to keep the algorithm linear. The constraints (n‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ10‚Åµ, k‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ15) hint that a naive exponential search will fail.

---

### 2. Problem Breakdown  

- **Bitwise OR** combines bits: if any number has a 1 at a position, the result will have a 1 there.  
- **Doubling an element** is the same as left‚Äëshifting by one: `x * 2 == x << 1`.  
- You may perform the shift on *any* element, possibly the same element multiple times.  
- `k` is small (‚â§‚ÄØ15), but `n` can be large (‚â§‚ÄØ10‚Åµ).

---

### 3. Brute‚ÄëForce Approach  

You could try all `k`-length sequences of indices to shift (each of the `n` elements can be chosen).  
- Complexity: O(n·µè) ‚Üí impossible for n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ10‚Åµ.  
- Even enumerating all subsets of indices is 2‚Åø.  

**Good**: Easy to understand.  
**Bad**: Completely infeasible.

---

### 4. Insight ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhy Double Only One Element?‚Äù  

- Doubling moves a set bit one position left.  
- The **most significant set bit (MSB)** contributes the biggest value to the OR result.  
- If we split the `k` shifts among several numbers, each individual number‚Äôs MSB can only move `k‚ÇÅ, k‚ÇÇ,‚Ä¶` places, never exceeding `k` shifts.  
- The OR of all numbers can never have a bit set beyond the furthest shift of a single number.  
- Hence, *putting all `k` shifts on the element with the highest MSB* maximizes the final OR.  

> **Ugly part**: Proving the greedy choice formally might feel non‚Äëintuitive. But a quick counter‚Äëexample shows any distribution that isn‚Äôt all‚Äëto‚Äëone leaves a higher bit unset.

---

### 5. Optimal One‚ÄëPass Solution  

Instead of choosing which element to shift, we can pre‚Äëcompute the OR of all elements **before** and **after** each position.  

#### 5.1 Prefix & Suffix OR  

- `prefix[i]` = OR of `nums[0 ‚Ä¶ i-1]`.  
- `suffix[i]` = OR of `nums[i+1 ‚Ä¶ n-1]`.  

These can be built in a single pass each.

#### 5.2 Candidate for Each Index  

For index `i`, if we apply all `k` shifts to `nums[i]`:

```
candidate = prefix[i] | (nums[i] << k) | suffix[i]
```

Take the maximum `candidate` over all `i`.

#### 5.3 Why This Works  

- `prefix[i]` and `suffix[i]` already contain all the bits from numbers *outside* `i`.  
- Shifting `nums[i]` by `k` positions only potentially sets new high bits that were not set elsewhere.  
- The OR of these three parts is the best we can achieve if we double `nums[i]` `k` times.  
- Checking all indices ensures we consider the best element to double.

#### 5.4 Complexity  

- **Time**: O(n) ‚Äì one pass to build `suffix`, one pass to evaluate candidates.  
- **Space**: O(n) ‚Äì arrays `prefix` & `suffix` (can be compressed to O(1) by building `suffix` on‚Äëthe‚Äëfly if you‚Äôre memory‚Äëtight).  
- The `k` value only influences a constant shift operation.

---

### 6. Edge‚ÄëCase Checklist  

| Edge Case | What to Watch For |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `k == 0` | No shift ‚Üí answer is the plain OR of the array. |
| `n == 1` | Shifting the single element gives `nums[0] << k`. |
| Numbers may already have high bits set at positions ‚â•‚ÄØk | Shifting still can set even higher bits. |
| Negative numbers? | The problem guarantees non‚Äënegative ints (0‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØnums[i]‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ2¬≥¬π). |

---

### 7. Pros & Cons (Good & Bad)

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Conceptual clarity** | Greedy intuition + OR pre‚Äëcomputation is neat. | Requires understanding that MSB dominates. | The greedy proof can feel like a ‚Äúhorror‚Äù step if not explained. |
| **Scalability** | Works for n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ10‚Åµ easily. | ‚Äì | ‚Äì |
| **Memory** | O(n) extra arrays. | Might be a concern for strict memory limits. | Could be trimmed to O(1) by keeping the running suffix OR while iterating left‚Äëto‚Äëright. |
| **Implementability** | Straightforward loops. | None. | The left‚Äëshift cast to 64‚Äëbit (`long` in Java / `long long` in C++) is a tiny detail that can trip beginners. |
| **Interview‚Äëtalk** | You can talk about bitwise OR, greedy, prefix/suffix. | None. | The proof‚Äëof‚Äëoptimality can be a conversation starter; be ready to explain it clearly. |

---

### 8. Alternate O(1) Space Variant  

You can avoid storing the entire suffix array by building the suffix OR in reverse and evaluating immediately:

```java
int suffixOr = 0;          // OR of elements after the current
for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
    long candidate = ((long)nums[i] << k) | suffixOr | prefixOr;
    best = Math.max(best, candidate);
    suffixOr |= nums[i];
    prefixOr |= nums[i];
}
```

This uses only a few integer variables.

---

### 9. Real‚ÄëWorld Interview Talk  

- **Highlight** the bit‚Äëshifting equivalence to left‚Äëshift.  
- **Explain** the greedy ‚Äúall‚Äëshifts‚Äëto‚Äëone‚Äù intuition.  
- **Show** the prefix/suffix trick as a classic O(n) pattern.  
- **Mention** the small `k` ‚Üí we could do an O(k‚ÄØ¬∑‚ÄØn) DP if we wanted constant space, but the current solution is clean.  
- **Prepare** a quick counter‚Äëexample if the interviewer asks ‚Äúwhy not split shifts?‚Äù

### 10. Take‚ÄëAway Checklist for Your Next Interview

| ‚úÖ Item | Why it matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Bitwise operations** | Core of many system‚Äëdesign/algorithms interviews. |
| **Greedy proof** | Shows you can reason about optimality. |
| **Linear solution** | Demonstrates ability to handle large `n`. |
| **Multiple‚Äëlanguage implementation** | Interviewers love seeing you can adapt to language constraints. |
| **Complexity analysis** | Always discuss time/space. |
