        # Remove Trailing Zeros From a String – 2710 LeetCode  
*Java | Python | C++ – Interview‑Ready Solution + SEO‑Optimised Blog Post*

## 🚀 Why This Problem Matters

- **Common Interview Question** – “Remove trailing zeros from a number represented as a string.”  
- **Demonstrates**:  
  - Understanding of string manipulation.  
  - Efficient loop logic (no regex, no integer conversion).  
  - Edge‑case awareness (all zeros, no zeros, short strings).  
- **SEO Tags**: *LeetCode 2710*, *Remove Trailing Zeros*, *Java solution*, *Python solution*, *C++ solution*, *Job interview coding*, *String manipulation*, *O(n) time*, *O(1) space*

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `num` represented as a string, return the integer `num` **without trailing zeros** as a string.

```
Input   : num = "51230100"
Output  : "512301"

Input   : num = "123"
Output  : "123"
```

**Constraints**

- `1 ≤ num.length ≤ 1000`
- `num` consists of digits only.
- `num` does not have leading zeros.

## ✅ The “Good” – A Clean, O(n) Solution

The fastest way is to walk the string **backwards** until we hit a non‑zero digit, then return the substring up to that point.

### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public String removeTrailingZeros(String num) {
        int i = num.length() - 1;          // start from the end
        while (i >= 0 && num.charAt(i) == '0') {
            i--;                            // skip zeros
        }
        // substring(0, i+1) -> end is exclusive
        return num.substring(0, i + 1);
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def removeTrailingZeros(self, num: str) -> str:
        i = len(num) - 1
        while i >= 0 and num[i] == '0':
            i -= 1
        return num[:i+1]
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeTrailingZeros(string num) {
        int i = static_cast<int>(num.size()) - 1;
        while (i >= 0 && num[i] == '0')
            --i;
        return num.substr(0, i + 1);
    }
};
```

#### Complexity

- **Time**: `O(n)` – single pass from the end.  
- **Space**: `O(1)` – we only use an index variable.

## ⚠️ The “Bad” – Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It’s Bad | What to Avoid |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **Regex `num.rstrip('0')`** | Still linear, but adds overhead and readability suffers. | Avoid when interviewers want algorithmic clarity. |
| **`Integer.parseInt(num)` then `String.valueOf(... / 10^k)`** | Overflows for large strings, and requires costly integer math. | Never convert huge numbers to primitives. |
| **Loop from the start** | You’d need to store all digits until you hit the first non‑zero, which is wasteful. | Always process from the end when removing suffixes. |
| **Off‑by‑one errors** | Returning `num.substring(0, i)` (missing `+1`) will drop the last non‑zero digit. | Remember that `substring` is *exclusive* at the end. |
| **Ignoring all‑zero string** | Though constraints forbid, defensive coding is good practice. | Handle “0” → “0”. |

## 🐛 The “Ugly” – Over‑Complicated Variants

Sometimes people over‑engineer:

1. **Creating an ArrayList of Characters** – unnecessary memory, adds complexity.
2. **Recursion** – stack depth equals string length, risk of `StackOverflowError`.
3. **Custom Stack Implementation** – re‑implements built‑in string manipulation.
4. **Multiple Passes** – first count zeros, second trim.

These approaches are fun academically but **never** in a coding interview. Keep it simple.

## 📦 Quick Test Suite

```python
tests = [
    ("51230100", "512301"),
    ("123", "123"),
    ("1000", "1"),
    ("10", "1"),
    ("5", "5"),
    ("0", "0")          # defensive, though not in constraints
]

for inp, exp in tests:
    res = Solution().removeTrailingZeros(inp)
    assert res == exp, f"Failed {inp}: got {res}"
print("All tests passed!")
```

## 💡 Interview Take‑aways

1. **Explain the O(n) logic** – “I walk from the end until I hit a non‑zero.”
2. **Mention edge cases** – all zeros, single digit, no zeros.
3. **Show the time/space analysis** – “O(n) time, O(1) space.”
4. **Why not use `int`** – overflow risk, not allowed by constraints.
5. **Why not use regex** – still linear, but extra overhead; interviewers often prefer explicit loops.
