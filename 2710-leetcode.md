        ## 1. The Code – 3 Languages, 1 Problem  
**Problem ID:** 2710 – *Remove Trailing Zeros From a String*  
**Difficulty:** Easy

---

### 1.1 Java – 100 % Pass, 1 Line Idea

```java
// 2710. Remove Trailing Zeros From a String – Java
public class Solution {
    public String removeTrailingZeros(String num) {
        // Start from the last character and move left until a non‑zero is found
        int i = num.length() - 1;
        while (i >= 0 && num.charAt(i) == '0') i--;
        return num.substring(0, i + 1);   // i+1 is safe because i == -1 -> empty string
    }
}
```

*Why it works*:  
`num.substring(0, i+1)` returns the original string up to the last non‑zero.  
If all digits are zeros, `i` becomes `-1` and the substring is empty – exactly the desired result.

---

### 1.2 Python – Concise & Pythonic

```python
# 2710. Remove Trailing Zeros From a String – Python
class Solution:
    def removeTrailingZeros(self, num: str) -> str:
        # rstrip removes trailing characters; here only '0' is targeted
        return num.rstrip('0')
```

`rstrip` is a built‑in O(n) method that scans from the end until a non‑matching char appears, matching the Java logic.

---

### 1.3 C++ – Fast & Modern

```cpp
// 2710. Remove Trailing Zeros From a String – C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string removeTrailingZeros(string num) {
        // Find last non‑zero using rfind
        size_t pos = num.find_last_not_of('0');
        return (pos == string::npos) ? "" : num.substr(0, pos + 1);
    }
};
```

*Key points*:
- `find_last_not_of` returns the index of the last character that is **not** `'0'`.
- If all characters are zeros, the function returns an empty string.

### 2.3 Problem Overview

> **Remove Trailing Zeros From a String**  
> **Input:** a positive integer `num` represented as a string.  
> **Output:** the same integer string with all trailing `'0'` characters removed.

This problem appears frequently in *Leetcode* lists under “String Manipulation” and is a classic interview warm‑up that tests your ability to handle edge cases and write clean code.

---

### 2.4 Constraints & Edge Cases

| Constraint | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| `1 <= num.length <= 1000` | The string can be as short as one digit or up to 1000 digits. |
| `num` consists only of digits `0–9`. | No need for regex or custom parsing. |
| No leading zeros. | Simplifies the problem; we only need to care about the end. |
| **Edge case**: All zeros (e.g., `"0000"`). | The expected result is an empty string (`""`). |
| **Edge case**: No trailing zeros (e.g., `"123"`). | Return the original string unchanged. |

---

### 2.5 The Core Idea – One Scan from the End

The most efficient approach is to *scan from right to left* until the first non‑zero digit is found. The position of that digit defines the cut‑off for the substring we want to keep. This yields:

- **Time**: O(n) – each character is inspected at most once.
- **Space**: O(1) – only a few integer variables, not counting the result string.

All three provided solutions (Java, Python, C++) follow this same logic, each utilizing a language‑specific method (`substring`, `rstrip`, `substr`).

---

### 2.6 Detailed Walk‑through of the Java Solution

```java
int i = num.length() - 1;          // Start at the last index
while (i >= 0 && num.charAt(i) == '0') i--;  // Move left while we see zeros
return num.substring(0, i + 1);    // i+1 is the end index (exclusive)
```

1. **Initialization**: `i` is the index of the last character.
2. **Loop**: The `while` stops when `i` is `-1` (all zeros) or the character at `i` is not `'0'`.
3. **Substring**: `substring(0, i+1)` extracts characters from the start up to `i`.  
   - If `i == -1`, the substring is empty.  
   - Otherwise, it contains the original number minus trailing zeros.

---

### 2.7 Alternative Implementations

| Language | Alternative | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| Python | `num.rstrip('0')` | One‑liner, idiomatic | Slightly less explicit, but perfectly fine |
| C++ | `string::find_last_not_of('0')` | Built‑in search | Returns `string::npos` if all zeros |
| Java | `StringBuilder` reverse and trim | Demonstrates mutable ops | Unnecessary complexity for this simple task |

---

### 2.8 Time & Space Complexity

| Algorithm | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Scan from end (all solutions) | **O(n)** | **O(1)** (ignoring output string) |

The algorithm is optimal: you must look at each character at least once to guarantee correctness.

### 2.9 Interview Talk‑Points

1. **State the Problem Clearly**  
   *“We’re given a numeric string with no leading zeros, and we need to strip trailing zeros. If the string is all zeros, return an empty string.”*

2. **Explain Constraints**  
   *“Length up to 1000 ensures we can afford a linear scan.”*

3. **Outline the Approach**  
   *“Scan from right to left until a non‑zero is found. Return the prefix up to that index.”*

4. **Discuss Edge Cases**  
   *“All zeros → empty string. No zeros → original string.”*

5. **Complexity Talk**  
   *“O(n) time, O(1) space – optimal.”*

6. **Show Code**  
   *Pick the language the interviewer prefers; demonstrate the solution with clean comments.*

7. **Mention Alternatives**  
   *“Python’s `rstrip`, C++’s `find_last_not_of`.”*

### 2.10 Common Pitfalls (The Ugly)

| Pitfall | Why it Happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Off‑by‑one errors** | Forgetting that `substring` is exclusive | Use `i + 1` carefully |
| **Assuming all zeros is impossible** | Not handling `num = "0000"` | Check for `i == -1` |
| **Using regex or heavy string operations** | Extra time/memory | Stick to simple loops or built‑ins |
| **Ignoring empty result** | Returning `num` unchanged when it should be empty | Explicitly handle `n == 0` case |
