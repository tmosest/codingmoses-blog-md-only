        # 🚀 Remove Trailing Zeros From a String – A Simple LeetCode “Easy” ✅  
**Problem**: 2710 – Remove Trailing Zeros From a String  
**Difficulty**: Easy | **Time**: O(n) | **Space**: O(1) (excluding output)  

> “Given a positive integer num represented as a string, return the integer num without trailing zeros as a string.”  

---

## TL;DR

- Scan the string from the end until the first non‑zero digit is found.  
- Return the substring from the start up to that index (inclusive).  
- Handles up to 1 000 digits, so a linear scan is fast enough.

## Why This Problem Is a “Job‑Ready” Interview Question

1. **String Manipulation** – Every developer works with strings daily.  
2. **Edge‑Case Awareness** – Think about numbers with no zeros, all zeros, or only one zero.  
3. **Clean Code** – Short, readable logic shows you can write maintainable code.  
4. **Algorithmic Thinking** – You’re showing that you can reduce the problem to a simple O(n) operation.  

If you nail this problem, interviewers will see you as a quick, reliable candidate who can handle typical interview tasks with ease.

## 1. The “Good” – Clear, Elegant Code

```java
// Java – O(n) time, O(1) space
public class Solution {
    public String removeTrailingZeros(String num) {
        int i = num.length() - 1;          // start at the last character
        while (i >= 0 && num.charAt(i) == '0') {
            i--;                           // skip all trailing zeros
        }
        return num.substring(0, i + 1);    // i + 1 because substring is exclusive
    }
}
```

```python
# Python – concise, idiomatic
def remove_trailing_zeros(num: str) -> str:
    i = len(num) - 1
    while i >= 0 and num[i] == '0':
        i -= 1
    return num[:i + 1]
```

```cpp
// C++17 – O(n) time, O(1) space
#include <string>
class Solution {
public:
    std::string removeTrailingZeros(std::string num) {
        int i = static_cast<int>(num.size()) - 1;
        while (i >= 0 && num[i] == '0')
            --i;
        return num.substr(0, i + 1);   // substr uses length, not index
    }
};
```

**Why these are “good”:**  
- **Single pass** – No extra data structures.  
- **Readability** – Loop condition directly states the intent.  
- **Edge‑case safe** – Works for `"0"`, `"000"`, `"123"`, `"51230100"`, etc.

## 2. The “Bad” – Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| Using `StringBuilder.reverse()` and then trimming | Over‑engineering, unnecessary copy | Avoid reverse; just scan from end |
| `return num.substring(0, i);` when `i` ends up at `-1` | Off‑by‑one error when all digits are zero | Use `i + 1` or handle empty result separately |
| Recursion on strings | Stack overflow for 1000 digits | Iterative solution is preferable |
| Forgetting that `substring` in Java is *exclusive* at the end | Off‑by‑one error | Use `i + 1` or `substring(0, i)` after `i++` in loop |

---

## 3. The “Ugly” – Over‑Optimized or Messy

```java
// 100% Java – but unreadable
public String removeTrailingZeros(String num) {
    int i = num.length();
    for (; i > 0 && num.charAt(i-1) == '0'; --i);
    return num.substring(0, i);
}
```

While this compiles, it is hard to read because the loop uses a **post‑decrement** and the condition references `i-1`. Clean code wins in interviews.

## 4. Complexity Analysis

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Scan from end to first non‑zero | O(n) | O(1) |
| Return substring (constant time in Java & C++, O(1) for Python’s slice) | O(1) | O(1) |

Total: **O(n)** time, **O(1)** auxiliary space.

## 5. Extending the Idea – Variants You Might See

| Variant | Approach | Key Insight |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Remove all zeros** | `num.replaceAll("0", "")` | Regular expression, but O(n) still, simpler to understand |
| **Remove leading zeros** | `num.replaceFirst("^0+", "")` | Regex for leading zeros |
| **Check if number is a multiple of 10** | `num.charAt(num.length()-1) == '0'` | Simple check, no removal needed |
