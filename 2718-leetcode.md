        ## üöÄ LeetCode 2718 ‚Äì Sum of Matrix After Queries  
**TL;DR** ‚Äì The trick is to walk through the queries *backwards*, keep a ‚Äúseen‚Äù flag for each row and column, and add the contribution of every *unique* row/column only once.  
Complexity: **O(queries‚ÄØ+‚ÄØn)** time, **O(n)** space.  
Below you‚Äôll find ready‚Äëto‚Äëcopy solutions in **Java, Python, and C++** (all annotated), followed by a short SEO‚Äëfriendly blog post that explains the idea, why it works, and how you can use it to impress interviewers.

## 1. The Code

### 1.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    /**
     * Returns the sum of all cells in an n x n matrix after applying
     * a list of row/column overwrite queries.
     *
     * @param n      matrix size (n x n)
     * @param queries list of queries, each query = [type, index, val]
     * @return total sum as long
     */
    public long matrixSumQueries(int n, int[][] queries) {
        boolean[] rowSeen = new boolean[n];
        boolean[] colSeen = new boolean[n];
        int rowCount = 0, colCount = 0;
        long sum = 0;

        // Process from last query to first ‚Äì ‚Äúlast wins‚Äù
        for (int i = queries.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int type = queries[i][0];
            int idx  = queries[i][1];
            int val  = queries[i][2];

            if (type == 0) { // row overwrite
                if (!rowSeen[idx]) {
                    sum += (long) (n - colCount) * val; // only fresh columns
                    rowSeen[idx] = true;
                    rowCount++;
                }
            } else { // column overwrite
                if (!colSeen[idx]) {
                    sum += (long) (n - rowCount) * val; // only fresh rows
                    colSeen[idx] = true;
                    colCount++;
                }
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### 1.2 Python

```python
def matrixSumQueries(n: int, queries: list[list[int]]) -> int:
    """
    Return the sum of an n x n matrix after processing all queries.
    queries: [[type, index, val], ...]
    """
    row_seen = [False] * n
    col_seen = [False] * n
    row_cnt = col_cnt = 0
    total = 0

    for typ, idx, val in reversed(queries):
        if typ == 0 and not row_seen[idx]:
            total += (n - col_cnt) * val
            row_seen[idx] = True
            row_cnt += 1
        elif typ == 1 and not col_seen[idx]:
            total += (n - row_cnt) * val
            col_seen[idx] = True
            col_cnt += 1

    return total
```

### 1.3 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long matrixSumQueries(int n, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<bool> rowSeen(n,false), colSeen(n,false);
        int rowCnt = 0, colCnt = 0;
        long long sum = 0;

        // Traverse from end ‚Äì last operation ‚Äúwins‚Äù
        for (int i = (int)queries.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            int type = queries[i][0];
            int idx  = queries[i][1];
            int val  = queries[i][2];

            if (type == 0 && !rowSeen[idx]) {
                sum += 1LL * (n - colCnt) * val;
                rowSeen[idx] = true;
                ++rowCnt;
            } else if (type == 1 && !colSeen[idx]) {
                sum += 1LL * (n - rowCnt) * val;
                colSeen[idx] = true;
                ++colCnt;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

> **All three implementations run in O(queries + n) time and O(n) memory** ‚Äì easily fast enough for the limits `n ‚â§ 10‚Å¥` and `queries ‚â§ 5¬∑10‚Å¥`.

## 2. Blog Article ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Sum of Matrix After Queries‚Äù

### 2.1 Introduction  

LeetCode 2718 ‚Äì *Sum of Matrix After Queries* ‚Äì is a classic interview problem that tests your ability to think about ‚Äúoverwrites‚Äù in a 2‚ÄëD space.  
The task is simple to state: you start with an all‚Äëzero `n √ó n` matrix, then a series of **row** or **column** assignments are applied. After all queries, compute the total sum of the matrix.

Why does this matter?  
* In real‚Äëworld systems you often *overwrite* entire rows or columns (think spreadsheet updates, GPU shaders, or database bulk operations).  
* Interviewers love problems that require you to avoid an obvious `O(n¬≤)` simulation, because they reveal your awareness of algorithmic optimization.

Below I‚Äôll walk through the **good** (what‚Äôs right), the **bad** (common pitfalls), and the **ugly** (the messy, but possible, solutions).

---

### 2.2 The Good ‚Äì A Clean O(queries + n) Solution  

**Key Insight:**  
The *last* query that touches a particular row or column is the only one that matters for the final matrix.  

Hence, we can process the queries **backwards**.  
While iterating from the end:

1. Keep two boolean arrays ‚Äì `rowSeen[n]` and `colSeen[n]`.  
2. Maintain counts of how many distinct rows/columns have already been ‚Äúfixed‚Äù (`rowCnt`, `colCnt`).  
3. When you encounter a row query `[0, r, val]` that hasn‚Äôt been seen:
   * Every column that **has not** yet been overwritten contributes `val` to the sum.
   * That contribution is `val * (n - colCnt)`.
4. Do the symmetric logic for a column query.

Because each row or column is counted **once** (the first time you see it in reverse order), the algorithm is linear.

**Why it‚Äôs ‚Äúgood‚Äù:**  
* Linear time, linear space ‚Äì well within LeetCode limits.  
* Intuitive once you understand ‚Äúlast wins‚Äù.  
* Works for the maximum constraints (`n = 10‚Å¥`, `queries = 5¬∑10‚Å¥`).

### 2.3 The Bad ‚Äì Na√Øve Approaches That Die

| Approach | Time | Space | Why it fails |
|----------|------|-------|--------------|
| **Full matrix simulation** | O(n¬≤ ¬∑ q) | O(n¬≤) | `n¬≤` can be 10‚Å∏ cells ‚Äì impossible. |
| **Track per‚Äëcell last writer** | O(n¬≤) | O(n¬≤) | Same issue ‚Äì too many cells. |
| **Forward scan with set** | O(q ¬∑ n) | O(n) | Still quadratic in worst case because you recompute each row/column many times. |
| **Ignoring duplicate queries** | O(q ¬∑ n) | O(n) | Still too slow; you‚Äôre doing 5√ó10‚Å¥ √ó 10‚Å¥ ‚âà 5√ó10‚Å∏ ops ‚Äì borderline or over. |

Interviewers often give the ‚Äúfull matrix‚Äù solution as an example of what *not* to do.  
Even a Python implementation that naively writes to the matrix cell‚Äëby‚Äëcell will TLE on the bigger tests.

---

### 2.4 The Ugly ‚Äì Messy Variants That Work but Are Hard to Explain

1. **Using `unordered_map` to record last write time** ‚Äì  
   *Store for every row/column the *time stamp* of its last assignment and then reconstruct the matrix.*  
   * Still requires `O(n¬≤)` for the final sum unless you do a clever math trick.  

2. **Bitset compression + BFS** ‚Äì  
   *Use a bitset to mark seen rows/columns and BFS to propagate values.*  
   * Works, but code becomes a labyrinth of bit manipulations that are hard to debug.

These solutions are technically correct but bring **verbosity** and **hidden bugs** (e.g., off‚Äëby‚Äëone errors in the multiplier `(n - colCnt)`).

> **Bottom line:** If you can finish the reverse‚Äëiteration solution in <‚ÄØ2‚ÄØminutes, you‚Äôve out‚Äëperformed the ‚Äúbad‚Äù ones by a wide margin.  

---

### 2.4 Why the Reverse Trick Works (Proof by Induction)

Let‚Äôs prove the backwards scan works:

- **Base case:** The very last query in the list touches some row `r`. In the forward simulation, after this assignment all cells `(r, c)` for all `c` become `val`. Since no later query overwrites `r`, the final value for row `r` is exactly `val`.  

- **Inductive step:** Assume that for every row/column processed so far (from the end) the sum contributed by *unique* rows/columns is correct.  
  When we next hit a new row `r`, every column `c` *not yet processed* (i.e., not seen in reverse) is still at its original ‚Äúprevious‚Äù value.  
  Thus, adding `val * (n - colCnt)` captures exactly the fresh cells that row `r` will own in the final matrix.  

By induction, each unique row/column contributes correctly, and duplicates are ignored.

---

### 2.5 Variations You Might Hear in an Interview

| Variant | Strategy |
|---------|----------|
| **Queries that add to a row/column instead of overwrite** | Keep *cumulative* sums for rows/columns, apply them in order, use prefix‚Äësums to compute final values. |
| **Sparse matrix (n is huge but few active rows/columns)** | Only keep dictionaries for rows/columns that actually appear; the complexity reduces to O(queries). |
| **Dynamic matrix size** | Use *hash maps* for seen flags; still O(q) time, O(#distinct rows/cols). |

If you can explain how the reverse‚Äëiteration idea adapts to any of these, you‚Äôll be a star candidate.

### 2.6 How to Use This Solution in an Interview

1. **Explain the ‚Äúlast query wins‚Äù property** ‚Äì it demonstrates you‚Äôre not just writing code, you‚Äôre reasoning about the problem.  
2. **Show the O(n + q) complexity** ‚Äì ask the interviewer if that is acceptable for the constraints.  
3. **Walk through the sample input** ‚Äì step‚Äëby‚Äëstep (e.g., `[0,1,5]`, `[1,3,2]`, ‚Ä¶) ‚Äì to show how the multiplier works.  
4. **Mention edge cases** ‚Äì e.g., duplicate queries, all rows then all columns, single‚Äëcell matrix.  
5. **Bonus:** Offer a Python or Java snippet on the spot.  

> Interviewers often look for *explainability* more than *speed*, so keep the explanation concise but complete.
