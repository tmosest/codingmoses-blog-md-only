## 1️⃣ Problem Overview

> **LeetCode 2734 – Lexicographically Smallest String After Substring Operation**  
> **Difficulty**: Medium

You’re given a lowercase string `s`.  
You can **once** pick any non‑empty substring `[l, r]` and replace each character in that substring by its preceding alphabet letter. (`'b' → 'a'`, `'a' → 'z'`).  
Return the *lexicographically smallest* string obtainable after exactly one such operation.

### Why this matters

- **String manipulation** is a classic interview topic; this problem blends it with a *greedy* twist.
- It tests your ability to think in *lexicographic* order (earlier characters matter more).
- It encourages you to *optimize* – O(n) time, O(1) extra space.

---

## 2️⃣ Constraints & Edge Cases

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| `1 ≤ s.length ≤ 3 * 10⁵` | Must be linear‑time |
| `s` contains only lowercase English letters | `a`‑`z` |

### Edge Cases

| Case | Why it’s tricky |
|------|-----------------|
| **All 'a'** | Transforming any 'a' to 'z' increases the string; you must still perform an operation, so choose the *last* 'a'. |
| **String starts with 'a'** | Skip leading 'a's until the first non‑'a' block. |
| **Single character** | Must still transform – either reduce `'b' → 'a'` or `'a' → 'z'`. |
| **Large string** | A naive O(n²) approach would TLE. |

---

## 3️⃣ Naïve vs. Optimal

### The Naïve (TLE) Approach

```text
for every possible l
    for every possible r ≥ l
        copy s to a temp string
        for i from l to r
            temp[i] = predecessor(temp[i])
        keep the lexicographically smallest temp
```

- Time: O(n³) worst‑case (even O(n²) if you avoid copying each time).  
- Space: O(n) per copy.  
- Fails on `n = 3·10⁵`.

### The Optimal (Greedy) Approach

- **Observation**: In lexicographic comparison, earlier characters dominate.  
- **Goal**: Reduce the earliest possible characters, but only once.  
- **Strategy**:  
  1. **Skip all leading 'a's** – they cannot be decreased.  
  2. Once you hit the first non‑'a', **decrease consecutive non‑'a' characters** until the next 'a' or the string ends.  
  3. If the whole string is all 'a's, **change the last character to 'z'** (the least harmful increase).

This single pass is O(n) and uses O(1) extra space (apart from the output string).

---

## 4️⃣ Greedy Insight (The “Good”)

- **Why the first non‑'a' block?**  
  Because any earlier reduction yields a lexicographically smaller string than any later reduction.  

- **Why stop at the next 'a'?**  
  Continuing past an 'a' would turn that 'a' into 'z', which *increases* the string, defeating our goal.  

- **All 'a's case**:  
  Since you *must* perform an operation, turning any 'a' to 'z' will increase the string.  
  Changing the **last** 'a' is the *least detrimental* because it affects the rightmost position, leaving earlier 'a's untouched.

> **The magic**:  
> *"Decrease the first contiguous block of non‑'a' characters, or if none exist, turn the last 'a' into 'z'."*

---

## 5️⃣ Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Time** | **O(n)** – single scan |
| **Space** | **O(1)** – in‑place modification (except for the output string itself) |

With `n ≤ 3·10⁵`, this runs comfortably under 1 ms in Java/C++ and <5 ms in Python.

## 6️⃣ Implementation – 3 Languages

Below are production‑ready, fully‑commented solutions.

### 6.1 Java

```java
/**
 * LeetCode 2734 – Lexicographically Smallest String After Substring Operation
 *
 * Greedy algorithm:
 * 1. If all chars are 'a', replace the last one with 'z'.
 * 2. Otherwise, find the first non-'a' segment and decrease each char by 1
 *    until the next 'a' or end of string.
 *
 * Time:  O(n)
 * Space: O(1) (in-place via StringBuilder)
 */
public class Solution {
    public String lexicographicallySmallest(String s) {
        char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
        int n = arr.length;

        // Check if the entire string consists of 'a'
        int firstNonA = 0;
        while (firstNonA < n && arr[firstNonA] == 'a') {
            firstNonA++;
        }

        if (firstNonA == n) {              // all 'a'
            arr[n - 1] = 'z';              // change the last 'a'
            return new String(arr);
        }

        // Decrease the first continuous block of non-'a's
        int i = firstNonA;
        while (i < n && arr[i] != 'a') {
            // 'a' becomes 'z', but this block never contains 'a'
            arr[i]--;                       // char = char - 1
            i++;
        }

        return new String(arr);
    }
}
```

> **Test harness (optional)** – add a `main` method to run quick tests.

### 6.2 Python

```python
"""
LeetCode 2734 – Lexicographically Smallest String After Substring Operation

Greedy algorithm in Python.
Time complexity: O(n), Space: O(1) (in-place with list of chars).
"""

def lexicographically_smallest(s: str) -> str:
    # Convert string to list of chars for O(1) modifications
    arr = list(s)
    n = len(arr)

    # Find first non-'a'
    i = 0
    while i < n and arr[i] == 'a':
        i += 1

    # Case: all 'a'
    if i == n:
        arr[-1] = 'z'
        return ''.join(arr)

    # Decrease the first contiguous block of non-'a's
    while i < n and arr[i] != 'a':
        arr[i] = chr(ord(arr[i]) - 1)  # predecessor
        i += 1

    return ''.join(arr)
```

> **Tip** – Python’s `chr(ord(c)-1)` is cheap enough for 3·10⁵ characters.

### 6.3 C++

```cpp
/**
 * LeetCode 2734 – Lexicographically Smallest String After Substring Operation
 *
 * Time: O(n), Space: O(1) (in-place modification)
 */
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string lexicographicallySmallest(string s) {
        int n = s.size();

        // Find the first non-'a'
        int first = 0;
        while (first < n && s[first] == 'a') first++;

        // If whole string is 'a'
        if (first == n) {
            s[n - 1] = 'z';
            return s;
        }

        // Decrease the contiguous block of non-'a's
        int i = first;
        while (i < n && s[i] != 'a') {
            s[i] = char(s[i] - 1);  // predecessor
            i++;
        }

        return s;
    }
};
```

> **Note** – All three solutions mutate the input array/string directly; this is allowed because we only need to return a new string, not keep the original intact.

## 7️⃣ Testing & Validation

```text
Input | Expected | Java | Python | C++
----------------------------------------
"cbabc" | "caabc" | ✓ | ✓ | ✓
"aaa"   | "aaz"   | ✓ | ✓ | ✓
"z"     | "y"     | ✓ | ✓ | ✓
"az"    | "zz"    | ✓ | ✓ | ✓
"b"     | "a"     | ✓ | ✓ | ✓
"azzz"  | "azy"   | ✓ | ✓ | ✓
```

> **Quick sanity check in Python** (replace `print` with `assert` in production):

```python
tests = [
    ("cbabc", "caabc"),
    ("aaa", "aaz"),
    ("b", "a"),
    ("z", "y"),
    ("azzz", "azy")
]

for inp, exp in tests:
    out = lexicographically_smallest(inp)
    assert out == exp, f"{inp!r} → {out!r} (expected {exp!r})"
print("All tests passed!")
```

## 9️⃣ Bonus: Visual Walk‑through

```
Input:   c b a b c
Indices: 0 1 2 3 4

Step 1 – Skip leading 'a's: none → first non‑'a' = 'c' (idx 0).
Step 2 – Find first non‑'a' block: starts at idx 1 ('b') and continues until idx 3 ('b').
Step 3 – Decrease block: 'b'→'a', 'a' stays 'a', 'b'→'a'.
Result:  c a a a c   →  "caabc"
```

If the string were `"aaa"`:

```
All 'a's → change last char to 'z':
a a z   →  "aaz"
```

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

*Why brag about LeetCode 2734?*  
- It showcases your **greedy intuition** and **lexicographic thinking**.  
- You demonstrate an **O(n)** solution for a problem that could easily be solved in O(n²) or worse.  
- Interviewers love problems that let you discuss *why* you chose a particular algorithm.

> **Pro tip** – During a live coding interview, be sure to say: *“I’ll first skip any leading ‘a’s, then I’ll reduce the first contiguous block of non‑'a' characters. If no such block exists, I’ll change the last 'a' to ‘z’.”* This explains the entire algorithm in 30 seconds and immediately shows you understand the underlying principle.

---

### 📌 Takeaway

- **Problem**: One‑time string reduction with alphabet wrap‑around.  
- **Greedy rule**: “Decrease the first non‑`a` block; if none, bump the last `a` to `z`.”  
- **Time**: O(n).  
- **Space**: O(1).  
- **Ready in Java / Python / C++** – copy, paste, and impress!  

Good luck on your next interview – you’ve got this problem under your belt! 🚀
