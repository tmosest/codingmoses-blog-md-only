        ## 1.  Problem Recap  
**LeetCode 2740 – Find the Value of the Partition**  
Given a positive integer array `nums`, split it into two non‑empty arrays `nums1` and `nums2` such that  

```
value = | max(nums1) – min(nums2) |
```

is **as small as possible**.  
Return that minimal value.

---

## 2.  Solution Overview  
1. **Sort** the array – `O(n log n)`.  
2. After sorting, the optimal split will always be *between two adjacent elements*.  
   *If you split after `i‑1` and before `i`, then `max(nums1) = nums[i‑1]` and `min(nums2) = nums[i]`.  
   Any other split would leave a larger difference.*  
3. Scan all adjacent pairs and keep the minimum difference.  

**Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)` (dominated by sorting).  
**Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (in‑place sort for Java/C++; Python’s sort is in‑place).

## 3.  Code

Below are clean, production‑ready implementations in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.

### 3.1 Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int findValueOfPartition(int[] nums) {
        // 1️⃣ Sort the array
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        // 2️⃣ Initialize answer with the first adjacent pair
        int minDiff = nums[1] - nums[0];

        // 3️⃣ Iterate over remaining pairs
        for (int i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, nums[i] - nums[i - 1]);
        }

        return minDiff;
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findValueOfPartition(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # 1️⃣ Sort the list
        nums.sort()

        # 2️⃣ Compute min difference between consecutive elements
        return min(nums[i] - nums[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(nums)))
```

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findValueOfPartition(vector<int>& nums) {
        // 1️⃣ Sort the vector
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        // 2️⃣ Start with the first pair
        int minDiff = nums[1] - nums[0];

        // 3️⃣ Scan the rest
        for (size_t i = 2; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            minDiff = min(minDiff, nums[i] - nums[i - 1]);
        }
        return minDiff;
    }
};
```

## 4.  Blog Article – “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of LeetCode 2740”

### 4.1 Introduction  

If you’re preparing for a software‑engineering interview, you’ll find yourself tackling a wide range of problems on LeetCode. **2740 – Find the Value of the Partition** is one such “medium” problem that tests a candidate’s ability to identify optimal partitions while keeping an eye on algorithmic efficiency.  

In this post, we’ll dissect the problem, walk through the most elegant solution, discuss common pitfalls (the “ugly”), and highlight interview‑ready talking points. We’ll also sprinkle in SEO keywords that recruiters love: *LeetCode, 2740, sorting, partition, interview, algorithm, O(n log n), coding challenge, coding interview question*.

### 4.2 The Good – Why This Problem is a Goldmine

| Aspect | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Simplicity of the final answer** | The minimal value is simply the smallest difference between two consecutive sorted elements. Easy to explain. |
| **Sorting mastery** | Demonstrates mastery of a core algorithmic tool. Sorting is a staple in many interview questions. |
| **Optimal‑substructure reasoning** | Shows you can reason about why an adjacent split is optimal—an excellent proof‑sketch skill. |
| **O(n log n) efficiency** | Acceptable for n ≤ 10⁵. Candidates can discuss how they achieve the required performance. |
| **Clean code** | The solution is short (≤ 5 lines per language) and easy to read, letting you focus on talking points. |

*Interview tip:* When you present the solution, start by saying “First, sort the array; this guarantees that the best split is between two adjacent numbers. That’s because…”. A concise explanation demonstrates deep understanding.

### 4.3 The Bad – Common Misconceptions & Edge Cases

| Pitfall | What to Watch For |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Assuming any split is optimal** | Some candidates incorrectly think they need to try all `n-1` splits, resulting in an `O(n²)` solution. |
| **Neglecting the “non‑empty” constraint** | Splitting before the first element or after the last is invalid. |
| **Off‑by‑one errors in indexing** | Using `nums[0]` as a candidate for `min(nums2)` is wrong. |
| **Misreading the absolute value** | Since `max(nums1)` is always ≤ `min(nums2)` after sorting, the absolute value can be omitted, but you should still justify this. |

*Interview tip:* “Because the array is sorted, `max(nums1)` will always be the last element of the left side, and `min(nums2)` will be the first element of the right side. Thus the difference is non‑negative, so the absolute value is unnecessary.”

### 4.4 The Ugly – Things That Can Go Wrong

| Scenario | Why It Breaks |
|----------|---------------|
| **Large inputs exceeding `int` range** | In languages like C++/Java, the difference between two 32‑bit integers can overflow if both are close to `10⁹`. Use `long` or `int64` to be safe. |
| **Stability of sort** | If you’re using a stable sort, it doesn’t matter; but an unstable sort could scramble equal elements, though the answer remains unchanged. |
| **Non‑uniform distribution** | If all numbers are equal, the minimal difference is `0`. Your code must handle this without underflow. |
| **Unsorted input with negative numbers** | Not a problem for this LeetCode problem, but good to discuss in general. |
| **Python’s default recursion limit** | Not applicable here, but a reminder that recursion depth matters in interview problems. |

*Interview tip:* “I used `int` in the C++ version, but since the maximum value is `10⁹`, the difference will always fit in a 32‑bit signed integer. Still, I’ll keep an eye on overflow if the constraints change.”

### 4.5 Step‑by‑Step Walkthrough (Python Example)

```python
class Solution:
    def findValueOfPartition(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()                      # 1️⃣ Sort
        # 2️⃣ Minimum adjacent difference
        return min(nums[i] - nums[i-1] for i in range(1, len(nums)))
```

1. **Sort** – `O(n log n)`  
2. **Scan** – `O(n)` – only one linear pass.  

If you want to avoid the generator overhead in Python, you can keep a variable:

```python
min_diff = float('inf')
for i in range(1, len(nums)):
    diff = nums[i] - nums[i-1]
    if diff < min_diff:
        min_diff = diff
return min_diff
```

### 4.6 Interview‑Ready Talking Points

| Question | Answer Outline |
|----------|----------------|
| *Why does sorting guarantee the optimal split?* | Because in a sorted array, the maximum of the left side will always be ≤ the minimum of the right side. Therefore, the only possible differences are between consecutive elements. |
| *What is the time complexity?* | `O(n log n)` due to sorting. The linear scan is `O(n)` and negligible. |
| *Can we do better?* | For this problem, `O(n log n)` is optimal because any comparison‑based algorithm must sort or find a minimum difference. |
| *How would you handle duplicates?* | The difference becomes `0`. Our algorithm naturally handles this. |
| *What if we had a `long` array?* | Just use a `long` type for the difference to avoid overflow. |
