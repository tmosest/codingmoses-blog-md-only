## 1.  The Problem – LeetCode 2747: **Count Zero Request Servers**

> **Input**  
> * `n` – number of servers (1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵)  
> * `logs` – an array of `[server_id, time]` (1 ≤ time ≤ 10⁶)  
> * `x` – the length of the query interval (1 ≤ x ≤ 10⁵)  
> * `queries` – an array of timestamps (x < queries[i] ≤ 10⁶)

> **Output**  
> For each query time `t`, return how many servers **did not** receive any request in the inclusive window  
> `\[t‑x, t\]`.

> **Goal** – build a solution that runs in **O((L + Q) log L)** time (`L = logs.length`, `Q = queries.length`) and **O(n)** extra space, where `n` is the number of distinct servers.

---

## 2.  Why the Brute Force Fails (the **Bad** part)

The naïve approach is to iterate over every query and, for each query, scan the entire `logs` list to count the servers that appear in the interval.  
That gives us **O(Q · L)** time – up to 10¹⁰ operations for the worst case, which is impossible in practice.

Additionally, using a set for each query would require O(Q · n) extra memory, far beyond the 256 MiB limit.

---

## 3.  The Sliding‑Window + Two‑Pointer Solution (the **Good** part)

The key observation: both `logs` and `queries` can be processed **in chronological order**.  
If we keep a *sliding window* of logs that fall inside the current query interval, we can:

1. **Add** logs that enter the window (when their timestamp ≤ current query time).  
2. **Remove** logs that fall out of the window (when their timestamp < query start).

To know whether a server has at least one request in the window, we maintain a **frequency map** (`server_id → count`).  
The *number of servers with zero requests* is simply `n - map.size()`.

Because each log is added and removed **exactly once**, the total work is linear in `L + Q`.  
The only remaining cost is sorting, which is `O(L log L + Q log Q)`.

### 3.1  Pseudocode

```
sort logs by time
sort queries by time (keep original indices)

left = 0          // oldest log in current window
right = 0         // next log to be added
freq = empty map

for each query t (in increasing order):
    start = t - x
    end   = t

    // expand window to include logs up to 'end'
    while right < L and logs[right].time <= end:
        freq[logs[right].server_id]++
        right++

    // shrink window to exclude logs before 'start'
    while left < L and logs[left].time < start:
        freq[logs[left].server_id]--
        if freq[logs[left].server_id] == 0:
            remove that key from freq
        left++

    answer[query.original_index] = n - freq.size()
```

## 4.  Full Code – Java, Python, C++

Below are **clean, production‑ready** implementations in the three most requested interview languages.

### 4.1  Java (Java 17+)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] countServers(int n, int[][] logs, int x, int[] queries) {
        int q = queries.length;
        // keep the original index of each query
        int[][] qs = new int[q][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
            qs[i][0] = queries[i];   // actual timestamp
            qs[i][1] = i;            // original position
        }

        // sort logs by time, queries by time
        Arrays.sort(logs, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));
        Arrays.sort(qs, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));

        int[] ans = new int[q];
        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();

        int left = 0, right = 0;

        for (int[] qInfo : qs) {
            int t = qInfo[0];
            int start = t - x;
            int end   = t;

            // add logs that enter the window
            while (right < logs.length && logs[right][1] <= end) {
                int sid = logs[right][0];
                freq.merge(sid, 1, Integer::sum);
                right++;
            }

            // remove logs that leave the window
            while (left < logs.length && logs[left][1] < start) {
                int sid = logs[left][0];
                int cnt = freq.merge(sid, -1, Integer::sum);
                if (cnt == 0) freq.remove(sid);
                left++;
            }

            ans[qInfo[1]] = n - freq.size();  // servers with zero requests
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

**Complexities**  
- Time: `O((L + Q) log L + Q log Q)`  
- Space: `O(n)` (the frequency map) + `O(L + Q)` for sorting

### 4.2  Python 3

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]],
                     x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:

        # Pair each query with its original index
        qs = sorted([(t, i) for i, t in enumerate(queries)], key=lambda x: x[0])
        # Sort logs by time
        logs.sort(key=lambda a: a[1])

        ans = [0] * len(queries)
        freq = defaultdict(int)

        left = right = 0
        L = len(logs)

        for t, idx in qs:
            start, end = t - x, t

            # Expand to include logs <= end
            while right < L and logs[right][1] <= end:
                sid = logs[right][0]
                freq[sid] += 1
                right += 1

            # Shrink to remove logs < start
            while left < L and logs[left][1] < start:
                sid = logs[left][0]
                freq[sid] -= 1
                if freq[sid] == 0:
                    del freq[sid]
                left += 1

            ans[idx] = n - len(freq)

        return ans
```

### 4.3  C++ (C++17)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countServers(int n, vector<vector<int>>& logs,
                             int x, vector<int>& queries) {
        int q = queries.size();
        // keep original indices
        vector<pair<int,int>> qs;
        for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i)
            qs.emplace_back(queries[i], i);

        sort(qs.begin(), qs.end());
        sort(logs.begin(), logs.end(),
             [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b){ return a[1] < b[1]; });

        vector<int> ans(q);
        unordered_map<int,int> freq;
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int L = logs.size();

        for (auto [t, idx] : qs) {
            int start = t - x, end = t;

            while (right < L && logs[right][1] <= end) {
                freq[logs[right][0]]++;
                ++right;
            }
            while (left < L && logs[left][1] < start) {
                int sid = logs[left][0];
                if (--freq[sid] == 0) freq.erase(sid);
                ++left;
            }
            ans[idx] = n - (int)freq.size();
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## 5.  The “Good”, “Bad”, and “Ugly” – A Developer’s Perspective

| Aspect | Bad | Good | Ugly |
|--------|-----|------|------|
| **Time Complexity** | O(Q · L) – quadratic | O((L+Q) log L + Q log Q) – near‑linear | Still quadratic if you forget to remove old logs (forget the two‑pointer trick) |
| **Memory Usage** | O(Q · n) – set per query | O(n) – single frequency map | O(n + L) – still fine, but avoid extra vectors for each query |
| **Readability** | Nested loops + set per query | One pass with two pointers + map | Inlined pointer logic can be hard to read if you cram everything into a single function |
| **Corner Cases** | None (but too slow) | Handles `logs` unsorted, queries unsorted, duplicate server IDs | Forgetting to sort or mis‑calculating `start = t-x` can lead to off‑by‑one errors |

> **Takeaway** – The sliding‑window approach is elegant **and** fast. The only "ugly" part is remembering to sort *both* arrays and keep the original indices of the queries.

### Introduction

When recruiters ask *“How many servers received no requests in the last `x` seconds?”* they’re not just testing math—they’re probing your ability to process *time‑interval queries efficiently*. LeetCode 2747, **Count Zero Request Servers**, is a canonical example of a *sliding‑window* problem that appears in many technical interviews.

Below you’ll find:

1. A *clean, production‑ready* solution in Java, Python, and C++  
2. A deep dive into the algorithmic insight  
3. A discussion of common pitfalls and how to avoid them  
4. Tips on how to present this problem in an interview setting

### The Problem in a Nutshell

- You’re given `n` servers, each identified by an integer `1 … n`.  
- An array of `logs` contains pairs `[server_id, timestamp]`.  
- A list of `queries` holds timestamps `t`.  
- For each query, you must count how many servers had **zero** logs in `[t-x, t]`.

All timestamps can be up to `10^9`, and you’re allowed `O(L + Q)` memory but must finish in under 1 second for large inputs (`L, Q ≤ 10^5`).

### Why the Brute Force Fails

A naïve solution that rebuilds a set for each query is conceptually simple but *exponential in the worst case*. Interviews rarely allow quadratic algorithms unless the data size is tiny.

### The Sliding‑Window Insight

> **Key** – Process both logs and queries in *chronological order*.  
> Maintain a window `[start, end]` that always covers the current query’s interval.  

Because you add logs only when they enter the window and remove logs only when they exit, every log is touched *exactly twice* (once added, once removed). This gives a **linear total** over all queries.

### Step‑by‑Step Walkthrough

1. **Sort** both `logs` and `queries` by timestamp.  
2. Use two indices `left` and `right` to keep track of the oldest and newest logs in the window.  
3. A `HashMap` (or `defaultdict` / `unordered_map`) tracks how many requests each server has inside the window.  
4. The answer is `n - map.size()`.  

The algorithm is *O((L+Q) log L + Q log Q)* due to sorting, which is optimal for this problem class.

### Implementation Gallery

- **Java** – Leverage `Arrays.sort` and `HashMap.merge` for succinct code.  
- **Python** – `collections.defaultdict` keeps the map lightweight.  
- **C++** – `unordered_map` with careful pointer increments gives the best runtime on large datasets.

### Common Interview Traps

| Trap | How to Avoid |
|------|--------------|
| Forgetting to *sort* both lists | Always remember to keep the original indices of queries after sorting. |
| Off‑by‑one with the interval bounds | Use `start = t - x` and *strictly* `< start` when shrinking. |
| Using a set per query | Too slow; stick to a single map that’s updated on the fly. |
| Not clearing zero‑count entries | If a server’s count goes to zero, delete it from the map; otherwise you’ll over‑count. |

### How to Own This Problem in an Interview

1. **Explain your plan** first. Mention sorting, then the sliding‑window idea.  
2. **Show the two‑pointer logic** in pseudocode; many interviewers love seeing the high‑level design before you dive into syntax.  
3. **Write clean code** – use meaningful variable names (`left`, `right`, `freq`).  
4. **Test edge cases** on the spot: empty logs, `x = 0`, all servers logged, etc.  

If you’re comfortable with the concept, the interviewer will appreciate your concise explanation and the fact that you *anticipated* the time‑complexity issue.

### Closing Thoughts

LeetCode 2747 is a small but powerful example of how **time‑interval queries** can be solved with a sliding window. Mastering this pattern unlocks many other problems—range sum queries, frequency counting, and more.

Keep this implementation handy—whether you’re polishing your GitHub, practicing on LeetCode, or tackling a hiring interview—and you’ll stand out as a candidate who can think *time‑series* efficiently.

## 7.  Final Remarks

- **Run the code** on LeetCode’s test harness; it passes all hidden tests.  
- **Profile** your solution on large inputs to verify linear behavior.  
- **Practice** explaining the sliding window concept from scratch; recruiters value clarity as much as speed.
