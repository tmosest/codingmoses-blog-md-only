## TL;DR  
> **Problem** ‚Äì Given a 2‚ÄëD array `nodes = [[id, parentId], ‚Ä¶]` that represents a binary tree, determine whether the array is a *preorder* traversal of **any** binary tree.  
> **Answer** ‚Äì Yes ‚Äì the solution is to simulate a preorder walk with a stack and verify that the parent of each visited node is still on the stack.  
> **Complexities** ‚Äì `O(N)` time, `O(N)` extra space (`N` = number of nodes).  

The following sections contain a full walkthrough, a ‚Äúgood, bad, ugly‚Äù analysis, and the code in **Java, Python, and C++**. At the end you‚Äôll find a SEO‚Äëoptimized blog article that you can copy‚Äëpaste to Medium, Dev.to, or your own blog to land your next interview gig.

## üìå Problem Summary

You are given a list of `nodes`.  
Each entry is `[id, parentId]` where:

| index | `id` | `parentId` |
|-------|------|------------|
| i     | node identifier (unique) | identifier of its parent or `-1` if it is the root |

The input is guaranteed to describe a binary tree (every node has at most two children).  
Your task: **Return `true` if the array is a preorder traversal of *some* binary tree, otherwise return `false`.**

> **Preorder** ‚Äì visit current node ‚Üí traverse left subtree ‚Üí traverse right subtree.

## üîç Key Insight

During a preorder walk you always keep the *ancestors* of the current node on a stack.  
When you visit a node:

1. All its ancestors are already on the stack (in order from root to the node‚Äôs parent).  
2. The node‚Äôs parent must be **exactly** the *top* element of that stack (unless it‚Äôs the root).

So we can validate the array by:

1. Pushing the first node (root) onto a stack.  
2. For each subsequent node `[cur, parent]`  
   * Pop stack elements until the top equals `parent`.  
   * If the stack becomes empty before finding `parent`, the array cannot be a preorder.  
   * Push `cur` onto the stack.

If we finish without failure, the array is a valid preorder traversal.

## üì¶ Code

> **Important** ‚Äì All three implementations are written for **LeetCode‚Äôs** Java, Python, and C++ templates.  
> They use the same logic but follow language‚Äëspecific idioms.

### Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean isPreorder(List<List<Integer>> nodes) {
        // The first node must be the root.
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        stack.addLast(nodes.get(0).get(0));

        for (int i = 1; i < nodes.size(); i++) {
            int cur = nodes.get(i).get(0);
            int parent = nodes.get(i).get(1);

            // Pop until the stack's top is the parent.
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peekLast() != parent) {
                stack.pollLast();
            }

            // If we couldn't find the parent, not a valid preorder.
            if (stack.isEmpty()) {
                return false;
            }

            // Current node becomes the new active node.
            stack.addLast(cur);
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def isPreorder(self, nodes: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        stack = [nodes[0][0]]                # root id

        for cur, parent in nodes[1:]:
            # Pop until the top equals the parent
            while stack and stack[-1] != parent:
                stack.pop()

            if not stack:                    # parent not found
                return False

            stack.append(cur)

        return True
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPreorder(vector<vector<int>>& nodes) {
        vector<int> stack;
        stack.push_back(nodes[0][0]);               // root

        for (size_t i = 1; i < nodes.size(); ++i) {
            int cur = nodes[i][0];
            int parent = nodes[i][1];

            while (!stack.empty() && stack.back() != parent) {
                stack.pop_back();
            }

            if (stack.empty()) return false;       // parent missing

            stack.push_back(cur);
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

## üöÄ Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Java | Python | C++ |
|--------|------|--------|-----|
| **Time** | `O(N)` ‚Äì each node is processed once. | `O(N)` | `O(N)` |
| **Space** | `O(N)` ‚Äì stack holds at most the current ancestor chain. | `O(N)` | `O(N)` |
| **Auxiliary** | Stack | Stack | Stack |

## üß© ‚ÄúGood, Bad, Ugly‚Äù Discussion

| Category | What Worked | What Didn‚Äôt Work | Lessons Learned |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Good** | *Linear* algorithm ‚Äì perfect for `n <= 10^5`. <br> *Simple* stack logic ‚Äì easy to reason and debug. <br> *Deterministic* ‚Äì no back‚Äëtracking, no recursion stack overflow. |  |  |
| **Bad** | The stack may grow to depth `n` in a degenerate tree (all nodes on one side). This still fits within `O(N)` space but can hit memory limits on extreme test cases. |  | Use an iterative stack; avoid recursion. |
| **Ugly** | The problem statement guarantees a *valid* binary tree, but if it were not, we‚Äôd need to verify binary‚Äëness (max 2 children) too. |  | Add child count checks if required. |

## üìö Practical Interview Take‚Äëaway

1. **Always think about the traversal invariant**. Preorder keeps a stack of ancestors.  
2. **Avoid naive tree construction** ‚Äì you can validate on the fly.  
3. **Consider edge cases** ‚Äì root, single child, deep skewed tree.  
4. **Explain complexity** ‚Äì interviewers love seeing `O(N)` reasoning.

### Introduction

If you‚Äôre hunting for a new role as a software engineer or just sharpening your data‚Äëstructure skills, LeetCode problems are a staple. One of the trickier ones is **2764 ‚Äì Is Array a Preorder of Some Binary Tree**. In this post, I‚Äôll walk you through the problem, give you a clean stack‚Äëbased solution, and share some interview‚Äëstyle insights. By the end, you‚Äôll have a ready‚Äëto‚Äëcopy code snippet in **Java, Python, and C++** ‚Äì perfect for your next coding interview.

### Problem Recap

You‚Äôre given a list `nodes = [[id, parentId], ‚Ä¶]` describing a binary tree.  
Your job: **Decide if the list is a preorder traversal of *any* binary tree.**  

Preorder means you visit the current node, then its left subtree, then its right subtree. The input is guaranteed to form a binary tree (each node has at most two children), but you don‚Äôt know the shape.

---

### Why the Stack Approach Works

During a preorder traversal you *always* visit an ancestor before any of its descendants.  
Thus, if you look at the current node you just visited, the stack of ancestors **must** contain its parent at the top.

By simulating this walk:

1. **Push the root** onto the stack.  
2. For each subsequent node:
   * While the stack‚Äôs top isn‚Äôt the node‚Äôs parent, pop ‚Äì that means we finished exploring a subtree.  
   * If the stack becomes empty before we find the parent ‚Üí the order is invalid.  
   * Push the current node onto the stack ‚Äì it becomes the new ‚Äúactive‚Äù node.

If you finish processing all nodes, the order is valid.

### Code ‚Äì Java, Python, C++

```java
// Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPreorder(List<List<Integer>> nodes) {
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        stack.addLast(nodes.get(0).get(0));          // root

        for (int i = 1; i < nodes.size(); i++) {
            int cur = nodes.get(i).get(0);
            int parent = nodes.get(i).get(1);

            while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peekLast() != parent) {
                stack.pollLast();
            }

            if (stack.isEmpty()) return false;      // parent missing
            stack.addLast(cur);
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

```python
# Python
class Solution:
    def isPreorder(self, nodes: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        stack = [nodes[0][0]]                    # root

        for cur, parent in nodes[1:]:
            while stack and stack[-1] != parent:
                stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.append(cur)
        return True
```

```cpp
// C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPreorder(vector<vector<int>>& nodes) {
        vector<int> stack;
        stack.push_back(nodes[0][0]);             // root

        for (size_t i = 1; i < nodes.size(); ++i) {
            int cur = nodes[i][0], parent = nodes[i][1];
            while (!stack.empty() && stack.back() != parent) {
                stack.pop_back();
            }
            if (stack.empty()) return false;      // parent missing
            stack.push_back(cur);
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time** ‚Äì `O(N)`  
  Each node is processed once; stack operations are constant‚Äëtime.  
- **Space** ‚Äì `O(N)`  
  In the worst case (skewed tree) the stack holds all nodes.

|----------|------|-----|------|
| Algorithm | Linear, simple stack logic | Stack may reach depth N | If the input wasn‚Äôt guaranteed to be a tree, we‚Äôd need extra child‚Äëcount checks |
| Implementation | Clean, idiomatic for each language | None | None |
| Interview Insight | Demonstrates understanding of traversal invariants | None | None |
