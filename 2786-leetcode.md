### TL;DR

| Language | Time | Space | Code |
|----------|------|-------|------|
| **Java** | **O(n)** | **O(1)** | `public long maxScore(int[] nums, int x)` |
| **Python** | **O(n)** | **O(1)** | `def maxScore(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int` |
| **C++** | **O(n)** | **O(1)** | `long long maxScore(vector<int>& nums, int x)` |

The algorithm keeps **two running scores** ‚Äì one for the best total if the last visited number is **even** and one for **odd**.  
At each position we decide whether to come from the same parity (no penalty) or from the opposite parity (pay `x`).  
The key is the simple recurrence:

```
dp[parity] = max(
                dp[parity]          + nums[i],     // same parity
                dp[parity^1] - x    + nums[i]      // opposite parity
            )
```

Because we only keep two numbers, the space cost is constant.

## üìö Problem Recap

> **You‚Äôre standing at index 0 of an array `nums`.**  
> You can jump forward to any index `j > i`.  
> Visiting index `i` adds `nums[i]` to your score.  
> If you jump from `i` to `j` and `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have different parities, you lose `x` points.  
> **Goal:** maximize the total score after any number of jumps (including staying at the start).

## ü§î Why DP Works

The decision at index `i` only depends on:

1. The **maximum score** achievable ending with an even number before `i`.
2. The **maximum score** achievable ending with an odd number before `i`.

All future moves are independent of the exact indices visited, only of the parity of the last number.  
Hence a two‚Äëstate DP is sufficient.

## üß© Algorithm Walk‚Äëthrough

| Step | What we store | Update rule | Why it works |
|------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Initial** | `dp[0] = dp[1] = -x` | `dp[nums[0]&1] = nums[0]` | We start at index 0. The other parity is impossible yet, so set it to a very small value (`-x`). |
| **Iterate i = 1 ‚Ä¶ n-1** | For the current number `cur = nums[i]` | `dp[cur&1] = max(dp[cur&1], dp[cur&1^1] - x) + cur` | Two options: come from same parity (no penalty) or from opposite parity (subtract `x`). Take the better. |
| **Result** | `max(dp[0], dp[1])` | ‚Äî | The best score regardless of the parity of the last visited element. |

> **Note:** All operations are `O(1)` per element, giving an overall linear time algorithm.

## üìå Code in Three Languages

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Java

```java
class Solution {
    public long maxScore(int[] nums, int x) {
        long[] dp = new long[]{-x, -x};      // dp[0] = even, dp[1] = odd
        dp[nums[0] & 1] = nums[0];           // start at index 0
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int parity = nums[i] & 1;
            dp[parity] = Math.max(dp[parity], dp[parity ^ 1] - x) + nums[i];
        }
        return Math.max(dp[0], dp[1]);
    }
}
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Python

```python
class Solution:
    def maxScore(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:
        dp = [-x, -x]                 # dp[0] even, dp[1] odd
        dp[nums[0] & 1] = nums[0]     # start at index 0
        for num in nums[1:]:
            p = num & 1
            dp[p] = max(dp[p], dp[p ^ 1] - x) + num
        return max(dp)
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxScore(vector<int>& nums, int x) {
        long long dp[2] = {-x, -x};          // dp[0] even, dp[1] odd
        dp[nums[0] & 1] = nums[0];           // start
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            int p = nums[i] & 1;
            dp[p] = max(dp[p], dp[p ^ 1] - x) + nums[i];
        }
        return max(dp[0], dp[1]);
    }
};
```

## üìà Complexity Analysis

| Complexity | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| **Time**   | `O(n)` ‚Äì one pass through the array. |
| **Space**  | `O(1)` ‚Äì only two long integers. |

Even for `n = 10^5` this runs comfortably under 0.1‚ÄØs in all three languages.

## üí° Why This Beats Brute‚ÄëForce

A naive approach would try all subsets or all jump sequences ‚Äì exponential time (`O(2^n)`).  
Even a dynamic programming that stores the maximum score for every index (`dp[i]`) would need to consider all previous indices, resulting in `O(n^2)` time.  

Our two‚Äëstate DP collapses the exponential possibilities into two numbers because parity is the only state that matters for future transitions.  This is the ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment that turns a hard interview problem into a clean, optimal solution.

## üìä Key Takeaways

- Two‚Äëstate DP (even/odd) reduces complexity from O(n¬≤) to O(n).
- Space can be dropped to O(1) by keeping only the last scores.
- The recurrence is simple: `dp[p] = max(dp[p], dp[p^1] - x) + cur`.

## üí¨ Common Interview Pitfalls

1. Forgetting to initialise the impossible parity with a very negative number.
2. Mixing up parity bitwise operations.
3. Thinking a `dp[i]` array is required ‚Äì it isn‚Äôt.

## üéì How to Master Similar Problems

- Focus on *state compression*: look for a minimal set of variables that capture future decisions.
- Practice parity and bit manipulation ‚Äì many DP problems hinge on them.

## üéâ Bonus: Visual Explanation (Optional)

You can add a simple diagram:

```
Index 0 (even/odd) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Index 1 (even) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Index 2 (odd) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ ‚Ä¶
          |               |               |
          ‚îî‚îÄ penalty = x  ‚îî‚îÄ no penalty ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫

```

Mark the two running scores and show how the transition takes the max of the two options.
