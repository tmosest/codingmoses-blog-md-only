        # 1.  Problem Overview – LeetCode 2799 “Count Complete Subarrays”

**Goal** – Count how many contiguous sub‑arrays of an integer array contain *exactly* the same number of distinct elements as the whole array.

| # | Example | `nums` | `distinct(nums)` | Complete sub‑arrays |
|---|---------|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | `[1,3,1,2,2]` | `3` | `[1,3,1,2] , [1,3,1,2,2] , [3,1,2] , [3,1,2,2]` |
| 2 | `[5,5,5,5]` | `1` | **10** (every sub‑array) |

**Constraints**

* `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 1000`
* `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 2000`

The challenge is to solve it faster than the naïve `O(n²)` brute‑force, which would be fine for `n=1000` but still feels like an interview “red flag”.

---

## 2.  The “Good, The Bad, and The Ugly” of Common Solutions

| Approach | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|---|---|---|---|
| Brute‑force (`O(n²)`) | Simple to write, easy to understand | Quadratic time – not ideal for larger `n` | None (not needed) |
| Sliding window with hash map (`O(n)`) | Linear time, minimal extra space | Requires careful handling of the window size | None – clean if coded correctly |
| Two‑pointer with array frequency (`O(n)`) | No hash maps – constant‑time updates | Needs pre‑determined maximum value (2000) | Harder to adapt for larger ranges |

> **Conclusion:** The *sliding window* approach is the sweet spot – linear time, simple logic, and straightforward to explain in an interview.

---

## 3.  Sliding‑Window Insight (Pseudo‑Code)

1. **Compute `k`** – the number of distinct elements in the whole array.  
   `k = size(set(nums))`
2. **Traverse with two pointers** `left` and `right`.  
   Keep a frequency map `cnt` for the current window.
3. Whenever the window contains **exactly `k` distinct values**:
   * Every sub‑array that starts between `left` and the current `right` (inclusive) and ends at `right` is *complete*.
   * Count them: `answer += right - left + 1`.
   * Shrink the window from the left to find the next possible start.
4. Continue until `right` reaches the end.

This gives an **`O(n)`** time algorithm and `O(k)` space.

## 4.  Full Code – Three Languages

Below are production‑ready, concise implementations in **Java, Python, and C++**.  
All three solve the problem in linear time.

> ⚡️Tip: The C++ version uses a `vector<int>` of size `2001` for O(1) frequency updates, avoiding unordered_map overhead.

### 4.1 Java (LeetCode style)

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int countCompleteSubarrays(int[] nums) {
        // 1. distinct count of whole array
        Set<Integer> all = new HashSet<>();
        for (int x : nums) all.add(x);
        int k = all.size();

        // 2. sliding window
        int[] freq = new int[2001];     // 1 <= nums[i] <= 2000
        int distinct = 0, left = 0, ans = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            if (freq[nums[right]]++ == 0) distinct++;

            // shrink until window has exactly k distinct values
            while (distinct == k) {
                ans += nums.length - right;          // all subarrays ending at 'right'
                if (--freq[nums[left]] == 0) distinct--;
                left++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

> **Why `ans += nums.length - right`?**  
> Once the window `[left … right]` has exactly `k` distinct elements, extending it to the right preserves the property.  
> All sub‑arrays `[i … right]` where `i` ranges from `left` to `right` are complete.  
> The number of such sub‑arrays equals `right - left + 1`.  
> The loop above does the same in reverse: for each `right`, we count the number of *starting positions* that produce a complete sub‑array ending at `right`.  
> Adding `nums.length - right` counts all sub‑arrays that end **after** `right` as well (the algorithm’s invariant ensures correctness).

---

### 4.2 Python 3

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def countCompleteSubarrays(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        k = len(set(nums))          # distinct elements in whole array
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        distinct = 0
        left = 0
        ans = 0

        for right, val in enumerate(nums):
            if freq[val] == 0:
                distinct += 1
            freq[val] += 1

            while distinct == k:
                # all subarrays ending at 'right' that start from 'left' or later
                ans += len(nums) - right
                freq[nums[left]] -= 1
                if freq[nums[left]] == 0:
                    distinct -= 1
                left += 1
        return ans
```

> **Pythonic touches**:  
> *`defaultdict(int)`* replaces manual map initialization.  
> *`len(nums) - right`* is the same idea as the Java version.

---

### 4.3 C++17

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countCompleteSubarrays(vector<int>& nums) {
        // 1. distinct count of whole array
        unordered_set<int> all(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int k = all.size();

        // 2. sliding window
        vector<int> freq(2001, 0);      // 1 <= nums[i] <= 2000
        int distinct = 0, left = 0, ans = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < (int)nums.size(); ++right) {
            if (freq[nums[right]]++ == 0) distinct++;

            while (distinct == k) {
                ans += (int)nums.size() - right;    // complete subarrays ending at 'right'
                if (--freq[nums[left]] == 0) distinct--;
                ++left;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

> **Why not `unordered_map`?**  
> `vector<int>` gives a constant‑time frequency update and keeps memory usage predictable – perfect for LeetCode’s input limits.

## 5.  Complexity Recap

| Language | Time | Space |
|---|---|---|
| Java | `O(n)` | `O(k)` (frequency array) |
| Python | `O(n)` | `O(k)` (dict) |
| C++ | `O(n)` | `O(k)` (array of size 2001) |

Both the algorithmic *time* and *space* complexities are well within the constraints and can be confidently pitched in an interview.

> **Keywords:** LeetCode 2799, Count Complete Subarrays, sliding window, interview coding, Java solution, Python solution, C++ solution

## Why This Problem Matters
In most coding interviews, interviewers look for two things:

1. **Correctness** – does your algorithm always return the right answer?
2. **Elegance** – is the code short, readable, and explainable?

“Count Complete Subarrays” scores high on both counts when solved with a sliding window.  
It forces you to reason about **how many sub‑arrays start at each index**—exactly the kind of *counting* trick interviewers love.

---

## 1. Problem Recap

Given an integer array `nums`, count how many contiguous sub‑arrays contain **exactly** the same number of distinct integers as the whole array.

> *Example:*  
> `nums = [1,3,1,2,2]` → 3 distinct numbers → 4 complete sub‑arrays.

---

## 2. The Good, The Bad, The Ugly

| Approach | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|----------|------|------|--------------|
| Brute‑force (`O(n²)`) | ✅ Easy to code | ❌ Quadratic, can fail on 10⁵ size arrays | Rarely used in interviews; only for small constraints |
| Sliding window (`O(n)`) | ✅ Linear, clear logic | ❌ Must understand window‑shrink invariants | **Best** for interview & production |
| Two‑pointer with frequency array | ✅ No hash maps | ❌ Needs fixed value bound | Use when `max(nums[i])` is small (like 2000) |

> **Bottom line:** The sliding‑window trick is the go‑to solution that you should always show in an interview.

---

## 3. Sliding‑Window Intuition

1. Compute `k` = number of distinct elements in the whole array.  
2. Walk through the array with two pointers (`left`, `right`).  
3. Maintain a frequency map `cnt` for the window `[left … right]`.  
4. When the window has exactly `k` distinct elements:
   * Every sub‑array that starts between `left` and `right` (inclusive) and ends at `right` is “complete”.
   * Count them: `answer += right - left + 1`.
   * Slide `left` to the right until the window contains fewer than `k` distinct elements, then continue.

This logic runs in `O(n)` time and uses only `O(k)` extra memory.

---

## 4. Code in Three Languages

### 4.1 Java (LeetCode ready)

```java
class Solution {
    public int countCompleteSubarrays(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> all = new HashSet<>();
        for (int x : nums) all.add(x);
        int k = all.size();

        int[] freq = new int[2001]; // 1 <= nums[i] <= 2000
        int distinct = 0, left = 0, ans = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            if (freq[nums[right]]++ == 0) distinct++;

            while (distinct == k) {
                ans += nums.length - right;          // all sub‑arrays ending at 'right' and beyond
                if (--freq[nums[left]] == 0) distinct--;
                left++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Python 3

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def countCompleteSubarrays(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        k = len(set(nums))
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        distinct = 0
        left = 0
        ans = 0

        for right, v in enumerate(nums):
            if freq[v] == 0: distinct += 1
            freq[v] += 1

            while distinct == k:
                ans += len(nums) - right
                freq[nums[left]] -= 1
                if freq[nums[left]] == 0: distinct -= 1
                left += 1
        return ans
```

### 4.3 C++17

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countCompleteSubarrays(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> all(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int k = all.size();

        vector<int> freq(2001, 0);
        int distinct = 0, left = 0, ans = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < (int)nums.size(); ++right) {
            if (freq[nums[right]]++ == 0) distinct++;

            while (distinct == k) {
                ans += (int)nums.size() - right;
                if (--freq[nums[left]] == 0) distinct--;
                ++left;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

All three compile under the LeetCode environment and run in **`O(n)`** time.

## 7.  How to Explain This in an Interview

1. **State the problem in one sentence.**  
   *“Count sub‑arrays that have the same number of distinct elements as the whole array.”*
2. **Show the `k` pre‑computation step.**  
   `k = len(set(nums))`
3. **Draw a quick diagram** of the sliding window:  
   ```
   nums:  1  3  1  2  2
   idx:   0  1  2  3  4
   left →          right
   ```
4. **Explain the invariant** – “When the window has exactly `k` distinct numbers, extending it to the right keeps the property.”  
   Thus we can count all sub‑arrays ending at `right` in one shot.
5. **Mention edge cases** – e.g. when `k == 1` every sub‑array is valid; the algorithm still works because the window will always reach `k` at the first element.

---

## 8.  Final Thoughts & Interview Take‑away

* **Why Sliding Window is Interview‑Friendly**  
  * It’s a classic pattern; interviewers love seeing you spot it.  
  * It shows you understand **time–space trade‑offs**.  
  * You can explain the intuition quickly (under 2 min).

* **Common Mistake** – Forgetting to shrink the window properly.  
  * Fix: Keep a counter of distinct elements and slide `left` until the count drops below `k`.

* **Practice Idea** – “Count Complete Subarrays” can be a great warm‑up for problems like *“Count sub‑arrays with exactly K distinct integers”* (LeetCode 992) and *“Subarray product less than K”* (LeetCode 713).  

---

### Suggested Next Steps

1. **Run the code on LeetCode’s test cases** – copy‑paste the Java, Python, or C++ snippet.  
2. **Add more test cases** in your own IDE:  
   * `[1,1,1]` → `6` (all sub‑arrays).  
   * `[1,2,3,4]` → `1` (only the whole array).  
3. **Explore variations** – e.g., “at most K distinct” vs. “exactly K distinct”.  
4. **Add the solution to your GitHub repo** and link it in your LinkedIn profile as a “Coding Interview Readme”.
