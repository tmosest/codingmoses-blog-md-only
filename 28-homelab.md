# Vertical Farming

Crane is coming along really nice! Had to print all 8 tower pieces unfortunately...

Also found a youtube channel

# LeetCode Solver... 

Got throttled... no worries there are some adaptations and pivots to be made.

I needed to stop just submitting witout running first... that was risky and I think what broke it... Got like 1K solutions for now...
and I missed my day streak... I need to force a reload on TODO page or it won't always see that the daily button isn't lite up...

Did that and throttling is fixed.

# Spider Man...

I now have a pet spider that I found in my kitchen... They are doing good still after a few days... fed them a dead bug and some water....
They made a web... which I want to look at under a microscope... still want a home made DNS snyth... one day!!!

Um IDK I made a 3D printed Spiderman mask that blinks when you touch the buttons on the checks! I just got to finish assembling it..

But that is not the priority!!!

# Lurtz HiWonder Robots

Made a git hub repo. The links needed are there. Got distracted from there several times because of dog and life...

Plus I wanted the Pipboy to have a batter and shell. And another wearable tech that I am working on...

# Steve Jobs... Monsanto...

I have a hypothesis that Monsanto accidentally killed Steve Jobs since he was a vegatarian and their presticides cause cancer...

Especially after seeing this YouTube documentary... they probably killed a bunch of people that I know...

I feel like fasting is probably the best solution to cancer at the moment... like weekly fast and 3 day fast onece a month or so...

Also there is a fungi that can kill humans if overexposed to it but it is amazing at killing cancer.
