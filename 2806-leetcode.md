        # 🚀 2806. Account Balance After Rounded Purchase – Easy LeetCode Problem  
**Languages**: Java | Python | C++  
**Goal**: Write a clean, one‑liner solution, explain the logic, and turn it into a blog post that’s SEO‑friendly and job‑ready.

---

## 1️⃣ Problem Overview  

- **Initial balance**: \$100.  
- **Input**: `purchaseAmount` (0 ≤ purchaseAmount ≤ 100).  
- **Process**:  
  1. Round the purchase to the nearest multiple of 10.  
     * If the last digit is 5 or more → round **up**.  
     * Otherwise → round **down**.  
  2. Subtract the rounded amount from the balance.  
- **Return** the final balance.

---

## 2️⃣ Example  

| purchaseAmount | Rounded | Final Balance |
|-----------------|---------|---------------|
| 9  | 10 | 90 |
| 15 | 20 | 80 |
| 10 | 10 | 90 |

---

## 3️⃣ Constraints  

- 0 ≤ purchaseAmount ≤ 100  
- Time complexity: **O(1)**  
- Space complexity: **O(1)**

---

## 4️⃣ One‑liner Logic  

The rounded amount can be computed directly:

```text
rounded = purchaseAmount + (10 - purchaseAmount % 10) % 10
```

- `purchaseAmount % 10` gives the last digit.  
- If it’s 0‑4, `(10 - digit) % 10` → 0 → round down.  
- If it’s 5‑9, the expression → 10‑digit → round up.  

Final balance: `100 - rounded`.

## 5️⃣ Code Implementations  

### 📚 Java  

```java
class Solution {
    public int accountBalanceAfterPurchase(int purchaseAmount) {
        int rounded = purchaseAmount + (10 - purchaseAmount % 10) % 10;
        return 100 - rounded;
    }
}
```

### 📚 Python  

```python
class Solution:
    def accountBalanceAfterPurchase(self, purchaseAmount: int) -> int:
        rounded = purchaseAmount + (10 - purchaseAmount % 10) % 10
        return 100 - rounded
```

### 📚 C++  

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int accountBalanceAfterPurchase(int purchaseAmount) {
        int rounded = purchaseAmount + (10 - purchaseAmount % 10) % 10;
        return 100 - rounded;
    }
};
```

All three snippets run in **O(1)** time and **O(1)** space.

---

## 6️⃣ Edge‑Case Testing  

| purchaseAmount | Expected | Output |
|-----------------|----------|--------|
| 0   | 100 | 100 |
| 5   | 90  | 90  |
| 45  | 60  | 60  |
| 50  | 50  | 50  |
| 100 | 0   | 0   |

The formula works for every boundary condition because the modulo operation and the addition of `10` always produce a valid multiple of 10.

## 7️⃣ The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly  

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Good** | O(1) solution; no loops or extra space; intuitive rounding logic | • | • |
| **Bad** | Some candidates over‑engineer with conditional statements; still O(1) but longer | Overly verbose solutions that confuse interviewers | |
| **Ugly** | Using `Math.round` or `DecimalFormat` in Java → unnecessary overhead | Hard‑to‑read nested ternary operators | Code that modifies the input parameter or uses global state |

**Takeaway**: Keep it simple, readable, and mathematically sound. One‑liner solutions are great for coding interviews, but never sacrifice clarity.
