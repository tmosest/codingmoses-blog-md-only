        ## ✅ 2807. Insert Greatest Common Divisors in Linked List  
> *LeetCode Medium | Time O(n) | Space O(1)*  

> **TL;DR** – Traverse the list once, compute the GCD of each adjacent pair with the Euclidean algorithm, and splice a new node between them.  

Below you’ll find a complete, production‑ready solution in **Java, Python, and C++** plus a **SEO‑friendly blog article** that breaks down the problem, its pitfalls, and interview‑friendly take‑aways.

## 🧩 Problem Recap

You are given the head of a singly‑linked list where each node contains an integer value.  
Between every pair of consecutive nodes you must insert a new node whose value equals the **greatest common divisor (GCD)** of the two nodes.

```
Input : 18 → 6 → 10 → 3
Output: 18 → 6 → 6 → 2 → 10 → 1 → 3
```

*If the list has only one node, return it unchanged.*

Constraints  
- `1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 5000`  
- `1 ≤ node.val ≤ 1000`

## 🔍 High‑Level Strategy

| Step | What to do | Why it works |
|------|------------|--------------|
| 1️⃣  | **Edge‑case check** – if `head.next == null`, just return `head`. | No pair → no insertions. |
| 2️⃣  | **Iterate** with two pointers `prev` (current) and `curr` (next). | Allows constant‑time insertion. |
| 3️⃣  | **Compute GCD** of `prev.val` and `curr.val` using Euclid’s algorithm. | GCD is O(log min(a,b)) which is effectively constant for values ≤ 1000. |
| 4️⃣  | **Create new node** `gcdNode` and splice it between `prev` and `curr`. | Keeps list intact while inserting. |
| 5️⃣  | **Advance pointers**: `prev = curr; curr = curr.next;` | Move to the next pair. |
| 6️⃣  | **Return head**. | The modified list is now ready. |

---

## 📈 Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Formula | Result |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Time** | `O(n)` traversal + `O(1)` per GCD | **O(n)** |
| **Space** | Only a handful of variables | **O(1)** (aside from the new nodes which are part of the output) |

---

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Gotchas

| Edge case | Why it matters | Fix |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| Single node | No adjacent pair | Return early (`head.next == null`) |
| All equal values | GCD equals the same number | Still works – just inserts identical nodes |
| Negative values (not allowed by constraints) | Euclid handles positives only | Guard with `Math.abs()` if needed |
| Large chains (up to 5000 nodes) | Stack depth if recursion used | Use iterative approach (our solution) |

---

## 🎯 Interview‑Ready Takeaways

1. **Explain Euclid** – Interviewers love seeing the mathematical foundation.  
2. **Mention pointer manipulation** – Shows you can safely modify a linked list in O(1) per operation.  
3. **Discuss time/space** – Always bring up the complexity analysis.  
4. **Talk about edge cases** – Demonstrates defensive coding.

## 📦 Full Code

Below are clean, self‑contained solutions in Java, Python, and C++.  
All three use an **iterative** two‑pointer traversal and a helper function to compute the GCD.

        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;

        ListNode prev = head;
        ListNode curr = head.next;

        while (curr != null) {
            int gcdVal = gcd(prev.val, curr.val);
            ListNode gcdNode = new ListNode(gcdVal);

            // splice gcdNode between prev and curr
            prev.next = gcdNode;
            gcdNode.next = curr;

            // move forward
            prev = curr;
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        return head;
    }

    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int tmp = b;

# LeetCode 2807: Insert Greatest Common Divisors in Linked List  
*A Complete Guide for Java, Python, and C++ Developers*

---

## 📌 Problem Overview  

The problem asks you to **insert a GCD node between each pair of consecutive nodes** in a singly‑linked list.  
If the list has only one node, nothing should change.  

---

## 🚩 Constraints Worth Noting

- 1 ≤ #nodes ≤ 5 000  
- 1 ≤ node.val ≤ 1 000  

These limits make the Euclidean GCD algorithm practically constant‑time, and an iterative solution guarantees O(1) auxiliary space.

---

## 📊 Complexity Cheat Sheet

| Operation | Complexity |
|-----------|------------|
| Traversal | **O(n)** |
| GCD (Euclid) | **O(log min(a,b))** – effectively constant for ≤ 1 000 |
| Total | **O(n)** |
| Extra Space | **O(1)** (excluding new nodes) |

---

## 📚 Step‑by‑Step Approach

1. **Early return** for empty or single‑node lists.  
2. **Two‑pointer iteration** (`prev` and `curr`) to always know the current pair.  
3. **Compute GCD** using Euclid’s algorithm.  
4. **Splice** a new `ListNode` between `prev` and `curr`.  
5. **Move forward** to the next pair and repeat.  

This strategy ensures that we only touch each node a constant number of times and avoid stack overflow.

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why it Happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| Using recursion → stack overflow on long lists | LeetCode allows up to 5 000 nodes | Use iterative method |
| Forgetting to handle single‑node lists | No adjacent pair | Early `return head` |
| Using a naive GCD implementation (division by 0) | Wrong base case | Ensure `b != 0` loop |
| Mishandling `next` pointers after splicing | Dangling references | Set `prev.next = gcdNode; gcdNode.next = curr;` |

---

## 👩‍💻 Interview‑Friendly Discussion

> **“Explain Euclid.”**  
> The interviewer will check if you understand why `gcd(a,b)` is found via `a % b`.  

> **“Why did you use two pointers?”**  
> It shows you can modify a linked list in place with O(1) per insertion.  

> **“What’s the complexity?”**  
> Emphasize that the solution is linear in the number of nodes, and uses constant extra memory.  

> **“Any edge cases?”**  
> Mention single node, all equal values, and potential negative inputs.  

---

## 🔧 Implementation Details per Language

### Java
- Uses `class ListNode` as defined by LeetCode.  
- GCD implemented with a helper method `gcd(int a, int b)`.  
- Iterative while‑loop to avoid recursion depth issues.

### Python
- `ListNode` constructor mirrors LeetCode’s signature.  
- GCD via `_gcd` helper using tuple unpacking.  
- Inline comments for clarity.

### C++
- `ListNode` is a plain struct.  
- Uses pointer manipulation (`prev->next = gcdNode; gcdNode->next = curr`).  
- `gcd` function uses the same Euclidean loop.

---

## 🌱 Tips for Mastery

1. **Write a helper GCD function first** – it keeps the main loop clean.  
2. **Test with small lists** (1, 2, 3 nodes) to verify pointer logic.  
3. **Profile memory usage** – LeetCode limits total output size, but our algorithm never stores more than the input size plus the new nodes.  
4. **Practice explaining the algorithm** – Interviewers want you to articulate the logic, not just deliver code.

## 🎉 Summary (Good, Bad, Ugly)

| Category | What we did | Potential improvements |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Good** | Linear scan, constant space, simple Euclid. | None – the baseline is optimal. |
| **Bad** | Recursive solutions are easy to write but blow the stack for 5 000 nodes. | Replace recursion with iteration. |
| **Ugly** | Over‑engineering by pre‑computing all GCDs into an array then re‑building the list. | Avoid; splice in place instead. |
