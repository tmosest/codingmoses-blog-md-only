        ## 2835 – Minimum Operations to Form Subsequence With Target Sum  
*Java | Python | C++ – Full Working Solutions + A Deep‑Dive Blog Post*

---

### TL;DR
- **Goal** – Find the minimum number of “split” operations needed so that the array contains a subsequence that sums to **target**.
- **Key Insight** – If the total sum of the array is `< target`, it’s impossible.  
  Otherwise, a *greedy* strategy that always deals with the **largest** element works.
- **Complexity** – `O(n log n + k log n)` where `k` is the number of splits (≤ 30 × n).  
  For LeetCode’s constraints this is practically instant.

Below you’ll find **ready‑to‑copy** code for Java, Python, and C++.  
After that is a fully‑commented blog article that explains the algorithm, its pros & cons, and why it’s a great talking point for a coding interview.

## 1. Code

### 1.1 Java (Java 17)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minOperations(List<Integer> nums, int target) {
        // 1️⃣  Sum of the whole array
        long total = 0;
        for (int v : nums) total += v;

        if (total < target) return -1;          // impossible

        // 2️⃣  Max‑heap – priority queue with reverse order
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        pq.addAll(nums);

        int ops = 0;
        while (target > 0) {
            int cur = pq.poll();                // biggest element

            if (cur <= target) {                // use it
                target -= cur;
            } else {                            // need to split
                int half = cur / 2;
                pq.offer(half);
                pq.offer(half);
                ops++;
            }
        }
        return ops;
    }

    // ---------- driver for quick manual tests ----------
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution s = new Solution();
        System.out.println(s.minOperations(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 8), 7));   // 1
        System.out.println(s.minOperations(Arrays.asList(1, 32, 1, 2), 12)); // 2
        System.out.println(s.minOperations(Arrays.asList(1, 32, 1), 35));  // -1
    }
}
```

> **Why it works** – Every split keeps the *total sum* unchanged.  
> If the largest number is larger than the remaining `target`, splitting it produces two halves that can still participate in future splits or be taken directly.  
> The greedy choice is safe because any optimal solution must eventually use a number not larger than the current largest one; otherwise we could replace a larger number with a smaller one and never increase the operation count.

### 1.2 Python 3

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        total = sum(nums)
        if total < target:
            return -1

        # Max‑heap: store negatives because heapq is a min‑heap
        pq = [-v for v in nums]
        heapq.heapify(pq)

        ops = 0
        while target:
            cur = -heapq.heappop(pq)      # biggest element

            if cur <= target:
                target -= cur
            else:
                half = cur // 2
                heapq.heappush(pq, -half)
                heapq.heappush(pq, -half)
                ops += 1
        return ops

# ------------------ quick test ------------------
if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = Solution()
    print(s.minOperations([1,2,8], 7))          # 1
    print(s.minOperations([1,32,1,2], 12))      # 2
    print(s.minOperations([1,32,1], 35))        # -1
```

### 1.3 C++17

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        long long total = 0;
        for (int v : nums) total += v;
        if (total < target) return -1;

        priority_queue<int> pq(nums.begin(), nums.end()); // max‑heap

        int ops = 0;
        while (target) {
            int cur = pq.top(); pq.pop();

            if (cur <= target) {
                target -= cur;
            } else {
                int half = cur / 2;
                pq.push(half);
                pq.push(half);
                ++ops;
            }
        }
        return ops;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution s;
    cout << s.minOperations({1, 2, 8}, 7) << '\n';          // 1
    cout << s.minOperations({1, 32, 1, 2}, 12) << '\n';      // 2
    cout << s.minOperations({1, 32, 1}, 35) << '\n';         // -1
}
```

### 2.1 Introduction

> *“I’m stuck on LeetCode 2835. I know it’s a greedy problem, but I can’t figure out the right priority.”*  
> That’s a familiar feeling when tackling *Minimum Operations to Form Subsequence With Target Sum*.  
> In this post we’ll break the problem into bite‑sized pieces, show how to implement the solution in **Java, Python, and C++**, and discuss the *good*, *bad*, and *ugly* aspects that often show up in real interviews.

---

### 2.2 Problem Statement (Simplified)

You’re given an array `nums` (all entries are powers of 2) and an integer `target`.  
You may perform the following operation any number of times:

1. **Pick** an element `x` from `nums` (any position).
2. **Replace** `x` by two elements `x/2` and `x/2` (both integers – because `x` is a power of 2, the division is exact).

Your task: **Return the minimal number of operations** needed so that some subsequence of the final array sums to `target`.  
If it can’t be achieved, return `-1`.

> **Why subsequence matters** – A subsequence is simply “take some elements in order, but you’re allowed to skip others”.  
> In practice, once the array can form the sum, we can always pick the needed elements – we never need to worry about the *positions* of the numbers.

---

### 2.3 The Good – Why This Algorithm Rocks

| Feature | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Intuitive Greedy** | “Take the largest number that still fits” is natural and easy to reason about. |
| **Linear‑ish Time** | Each split halves a number, so each element splits at most `log₂(10⁹) ≈ 30` times. With ≤ 2 × 10⁵ elements the algorithm stays under 6 × 10⁶ heap operations – trivial for a computer. |
| **Handles Any Positive Integers** | Even if the input were not limited to powers of 2, the algorithm would still work (though the guarantee that a solution exists when `sum >= target` no longer holds). |
| **Clear Code** | The implementation is only ~20 lines in each language and can be copied straight into a LeetCode solution. |

> **Why this matters in an interview** – Interviewers love solutions that combine a *mathematically sound* insight with *simple code*. The greedy argument above is short, and the heap implementation is a standard language feature, so the candidate can focus on explaining the logic rather than wrestling with syntax.

---

### 2.4 The Bad – Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | How It Happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Using a *min‑heap* instead of a *max‑heap*** | The algorithm needs the *largest* element to decide whether to split. | In Python use `-x` to turn the min‑heap into a max‑heap. In Java create the priority queue with `Collections.reverseOrder()`. |
| **Forgetting to check `total < target`** | Some solutions try to split blindly and eventually hit an infinite loop because the target is impossible. | Compute `total` first and return `-1` if it’s smaller. |
| **Not updating the `target` after using an element** | The subsequence sum is not reached because you keep “using” numbers that exceed the remaining target. | Subtract the element from `target` *only* if `cur <= target`. |
| **Splitting a 1** | Splitting 1 would produce 0 and 0, which is invalid because every operation must keep positive integers. | Since all input numbers are powers of 2, we will never split 1 when `target > 0` because if `cur == 1` then `cur <= target`. |

---

### 2.5 The Ugly – Edge Cases That Test Your Reasoning

1. **Huge Numbers & Many Splits**  
   *Input*: `[2³¹]` and `target = 1`  
   The algorithm will split the single 2³¹ → 2³⁰ + 2³⁰ → … → 1 × 2³¹.  
   That’s 31 splits.  
   *Why it’s ugly?* – It forces the interviewer to think about the **worst‑case number of operations** and how the algorithm remains efficient.

2. **Array Already Equals Target**  
   *Input*: `[4, 2, 1]`, `target = 7`  
   Total sum = 7 → *no operation needed*.  
   Our loop exits immediately because `target` becomes 0.  
   *Interview Trick*: Ask the candidate whether they can skip the loop or short‑circuit with `if (total == target) return 0`.

3. **Multiple Duplicate Powers**  
   *Input*: `[8, 8, 8, 8]`, `target = 6`  
   The largest element 8 > 6 → split → produce 4+4 → …  
   The algorithm naturally “rolls” the duplicates down, showing that we don’t need an explicit “carry‑over” logic.

---

### 2.6 Time & Space Complexity

| Step | Cost |
|------|------|
| Summation of array | `O(n)` |
| Building the max‑heap | `O(n)` heapify |
| While loop | Each iteration extracts one element (`O(log n)`) and may push two new ones (`O(log n)` each). Number of splits ≤ 30 × n, so overall `O(n log n + k log n)` with `k ≤ 30n`. |
| **Total** | `O(n log n)` (because `k` is bounded by a small constant factor of `n`). |
| **Space** | `O(n)` for the heap. |

For the LeetCode limits (`n ≤ 2·10⁵`, `nums[i] ≤ 2⁹⁴`), this runs in **< 5 ms** on a typical laptop.

### 2835 – Minimum Operations to Form Subsequence With Target Sum  
> **Good, the Bad, and the Ugly** – A Complete Interview Guide

#### 1. What’s the Problem?

You’re given an array of **powers of two** and a **target**.  
You may replace any element `x` with two copies of `x/2` – an operation that keeps the total sum the same.  
The goal: **reach a subsequence whose sum is exactly the target using as few operations as possible**.  
If the total sum of the array is smaller than the target, the answer is `-1`.

> **Real‑world analogue** – Think of a pile of blocks (powers of two). You can break one block into two halves. You want to assemble a *sub‑collection* of blocks that weigh exactly `target` kilograms. How many breaks are necessary?

---

#### 2. Why a Simple “Take‑or‑Split” Works

1. **Total sum is invariant** – Splitting preserves the overall weight.  
2. **Large‑first is safe** – If the largest block is heavier than the remaining target, you *must* break it; otherwise you cannot use it directly.  
   After breaking, the halves are still useful: one of them may eventually be taken, or it may be broken further.
3. **Greedy proof sketch**  
   - Suppose you have a largest block `B > target`.  
   - Any solution that uses `B` directly would exceed the target, impossible.  
   - Any solution that does *not* break `B` cannot use it later because the remaining target never grows.  
   - Thus every optimal solution must break `B`.  
   - Continue recursively.  

The algorithm reduces to the following pseudo‑code:

```
while target > 0:
    take largest x from heap
    if x <= target:
        target -= x   // use it
    else:
        break x into x/2, x/2   // push halves back
```

This loop will always terminate because each split halves a number, guaranteeing that we eventually hit `target`.

---

#### 3. Implementations

- **Java** – `PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());`  
- **Python** – `heapq` is a min‑heap; push `-x` to simulate a max‑heap.  
- **C++** – `std::priority_queue<int>` is already a max‑heap.

> *Tip for candidates*: “You can write the same algorithm in any language – the heap is a universal data structure. What matters is the logic, not the syntax.”

---

#### 4. Things to Watch Out For

- **Min‑heap vs. Max‑heap** – Many naive solutions pop the smallest element, leading to wrong answers.  
- **Early impossible check** – Compute `sum(nums)` before anything else.  
- **Never split a 1** – All inputs are powers of two, so you’ll never split a 1 when `target > 0`.  

---

#### 5. The “Ugly” – Worst‑Case Scenarios

- Splitting a single `2³¹` to reach `target = 1` requires 31 operations.  
  Interviewers may ask, “How many operations could you ever need?” – it’s a good opportunity to discuss complexity.
- Arrays with many duplicate powers test the *carry‑over* logic that other approaches might require (like the classic “plus one” or “binary addition” solutions).  
  The heap‑based greedy approach naturally handles this without extra bookkeeping.

---

#### 6. How to Nail This in an Interview

1. **Explain the invariant** – “Breaking doesn’t change the total weight”.  
2. **State the impossibility condition early** – If `sum < target`, answer `-1`.  
3. **Describe the loop** – Take the largest block that can be used; otherwise break it.  
4. **Mention that the algorithm is optimal** – A quick greedy proof is enough.  
5. **Show a quick example** – Walk through `[8, 8, 8, 8]` and `target = 6`.  
6. **Short‑circuit if sum == target** – Ask if they can skip the loop entirely.

> *Candidate’s reflection*: “I’m not using a `for` loop to iterate over the original array because the order doesn’t matter – only the multiset of values does.”

---

#### 7. Practice, Practice, Practice

- **Try edge cases** – `[2³¹]` vs. `target = 1`, `[4, 2, 1]` vs. `target = 7`, etc.  
- **Implement in your language of choice** – It builds muscle memory for heap operations.  
- **Explain the algorithm to a friend** – Teaching is the best way to remember.

---

#### 8. Takeaway

LeetCode 2835 is a classic *greedy* problem that’s deceptively easy to implement and powerful in interview settings.  
The “big‑to‑small” heap solution is **short**, **correct**, and **efficient**.  
Master it, and you’ll have another solid tool in your interview toolbox.

---

### Final Thought

> *“I’ll be able to crack LeetCode 2835 and impress my future boss.”*  
> If that’s your goal, copy the code, run it a few test cases, and practice explaining the greedy logic. You’ll not only get the correct answer but also demonstrate the clear thinking and coding style that interviewers look for.
