        ## 2835 – Minimum Operations to Form Subsequence With Target Sum  
**Hard | LeetCode**

> **Job‑Hunting Edge:**  
> *This is the kind of LeetCode challenge that interviewers love: it mixes greedy reasoning, bit‑wise tricks, and a clear‑cut complexity analysis. Mastering it will make you a strong candidate for roles that demand algorithmic thinking and data‑structure fluency.*

### Problem Recap

You’re given an array `nums` that contains only powers of two (e.g. `1, 2, 4, 8, …`).  
You can perform an operation any number of times:

1. Pick an element `x` from the array such that `x > 1`.
2. Remove `x`.
3. Append two copies of `x / 2` to the end of the array.

The total sum of the array never changes.  
After any sequence of operations you need a **subsequence** (not necessarily contiguous) that sums exactly to a given `target`.  
Return the minimum number of operations needed, or `-1` if it’s impossible.



| Key Constraints | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 1000` | |
| `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 2³⁰` | All values are powers of two |
| `1 ≤ target < 2³¹` | |
| Time Limit | ~1 s |

## The Idea – “Big‑to‑Small Greedy”

1. **Total Sum Check** – If the sum of all numbers is smaller than `target`, it’s impossible → `-1`.  
   If the sum equals `target`, we’re already done → `0`.

2. **Greedy Pick the Largest Element** –  
   * Why largest?  
     * If the largest number can be *ignored* (because the remaining numbers still sum to at least `target`), it will never help us reach the target. Skipping it reduces the sum and keeps the rest untouched.  
     * If it is **required**, we either use it (if it does not exceed the remaining `target`) or split it (if it does exceed). Splitting keeps the total sum unchanged while producing smaller building blocks.

3. **Splitting** –  
   When the current largest number `x` is larger than the remaining `target` but `x > 1`, split it into two `x/2`. This consumes one operation, but the sum remains the same.

4. **Repeat** until `target` becomes zero.  
   Because each split reduces the *maximum* element, we’ll eventually reach a state where the largest element is `1` and we can finish the process.

5. **Proof of Optimality** –  
   The greedy choice of “skip if possible” is optimal because:
   * Skipping a large element can never increase the number of operations needed; it only removes a candidate that isn’t necessary.
   * If a large element is necessary, either we use it (exact fit) or we split it; no other operation can help more efficiently.

## Code Implementations

Below are clean, self‑contained solutions in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
All use a max‑heap (`PriorityQueue`/`heapq`/`priority_queue`) to fetch the current largest element in `O(log n)`.

### 1. Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(List<Integer> nums, int target) {
        // Total sum
        long sum = 0;
        for (int v : nums) sum += v;

        if (sum < target) return -1;
        if (sum == target) return 0;

        // Max‑heap
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        pq.addAll(nums);

        int ops = 0;
        while (target > 0) {
            int x = pq.poll();          // largest element

            if (sum - x >= target) {    // we can skip it
                sum -= x;
                continue;
            }

            if (x <= target) {          // we need this value
                target -= x;
                sum -= x;
            } else {                    // x > target and x > 1 -> split
                if (x == 1) {           // cannot split 1, but this should never happen
                    // If we are here, the algorithm is wrong
                    return -1;
                }
                pq.add(x / 2);
                pq.add(x / 2);
                ops++;
            }
        }
        return ops;
    }
}
```

*Use* `Solution s = new Solution(); s.minOperations(nums, target);*


### 2. Python

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        total = sum(nums)
        if total < target:
            return -1
        if total == target:
            return 0

        # max‑heap via negative numbers
        pq = [-x for x in nums]
        heapq.heapify(pq)

        ops = 0
        while target:
            x = -heapq.heappop(pq)          # largest element
            if total - x >= target:         # can ignore it
                total -= x
            elif x <= target:               # we need it
                total -= x
                target -= x
            else:                           # x > target, split it
                heapq.heappush(pq, -x // 2)
                heapq.heappush(pq, -x // 2)
                ops += 1

        return ops
```

### 3. C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        long long sum = 0;
        for (int v : nums) sum += v;

        if (sum < target) return -1;
        if (sum == target) return 0;

        priority_queue<int> pq(nums.begin(), nums.end()); // max‑heap
        int ops = 0;

        while (target) {
            int x = pq.top(); pq.pop();

            if (sum - x >= target) {          // skip
                sum -= x;
            } else if (x <= target) {         // use
                target -= x;
                sum -= x;
            } else {                          // split
                if (x > 1) {
                    pq.push(x / 2);
                    pq.push(x / 2);
                    ops++;
                }
            }
        }
        return ops;
    }
};
```

All three solutions run in `O(n log n)` time and `O(n)` memory – well within the problem limits.

## Good, Bad, & Ugly – Common Pitfalls

| Issue | What It Looks Like | Fix / Best Practice |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Skipping when sum‑x < target** | Wrongly *kept* a large element, leading to extra operations or even an infinite loop. | Always subtract the element from `sum` *before* checking. |
| **Splitting 1** | Attempting to split `x = 1` throws an exception or results in an endless loop. | Only split if `x > 1`. |
| **Overflow on Sum** | Using `int` for the total sum over 2³¹ can overflow. | Store the sum in a 64‑bit type (`long` / `long long`). |
| **Wrong Heap Order** | Using a min‑heap without negating or custom comparator leads to picking the *smallest* element, which breaks the greedy logic. | Use a max‑heap or push negative values. |
| **Missing Base Cases** | Forgetting `sum == target` → unnecessary ops counted. | Check the two base cases (`<` and `==`) before the loop. |

---

## Complexity Analysis

| Step | Cost |
|------|------|
| Sum calculation | `O(n)` |
| Heap construction | `O(n log n)` (Java: `addAll`; C++: constructor; Python: `heapify`) |
| Main loop | Each iteration does one heap operation (`O(log n)`).  
   In the worst case we split each element until all become `1`.  
   Total splits ≤ number of times we double the length of the array, which is bounded by `sum(nums)`.  
   Hence, overall complexity is `O(n log n)`. |
| Memory | `O(n)` for the heap. |

## “What If the Numbers Were Not Powers of Two?”

The same greedy strategy **does** work for arbitrary positive integers, because the split operation always produces two smaller numbers that add to the same total.  
Only the “powers‑of‑two” restriction gives us the handy *exact binary decomposition* guarantee that a solution always exists when `sum ≥ target`.  
If you remove that guarantee, you’d need a more sophisticated DP or subset‑sum algorithm.

## Take‑away for the Interviewer

1. **Explain the total‑sum sanity check** – shows you understand invariants.  
2. **Show the heap** – interviewers love seeing a data‑structure in action.  
3. **Discuss the greedy “skip or split” reasoning** – demonstrates algorithmic design.  
4. **Walk through a short example** on the board.  
5. **Mention the `O(n log n)` bound** – the interviewer will be impressed by your complexity awareness.
