## 1. Problem Overview
> You are given an array `nums` containing non‑negative powers of two and a target integer `target`.  
> In one operation you may take any element `nums[i] > 1`, remove it, and insert two copies of `nums[i]/2` at the end of the array.  
> After any number of operations, you want the array to **contain a subsequence whose elements sum to `target`**.  
> Return the minimal number of operations required, or `-1` if it is impossible.

*Example*

```text
nums = [1, 2, 8], target = 7
```

One operation (`8 → 4,4`) gives `[1,2,4,4]`, which has a subsequence `[1,2,4]` summing to `7`.  
Answer: `1`.

## 2. Key Observations

| Observation | Why it matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Total sum never changes** | Splitting preserves the sum, so if the initial total < target → impossible. |
| **If total ≥ target, a solution always exists** | With unlimited splits we can produce `sum(nums)` ones; any sum ≤ that can be reached. |
| **Powers of two** | Splitting only halves a number – each step turns a power of two into two equal smaller powers of two. |
| **Greedy from largest to smallest** | Whenever we consider the largest remaining element `x`:  
  * If the rest of the array alone can still reach the target (`total - x >= target`), skip `x`.  
  * If `x` fits into the target (`x <= target`), take it (subtract from `target`).  
  * Otherwise `x > target` → we need to split it. |

The greedy rule ensures we only split a number when it’s unavoidable, giving the minimal number of splits.

## 3. Greedy Solution – “Big‑to‑Small”

```text
1. Compute total sum of nums.
2. If total < target → return -1.
3. Sort nums ascending (or use counting sort because elements are powers of two).
4. While target > 0:
   a. Pick the largest remaining element `x` (pop from the end of the list/heap).
   b. If total - x >= target:  // we can ignore `x`
        total -= x
   c. Else if x <= target:     // use `x` in the subsequence
        total -= x
        target -= x
   d. Else (x > target):       // we must split `x`
        Push `x/2` twice back into the data structure
        operations += 1
5. Return operations.
```

Because we always work with the largest available value, we never split an element that could be omitted. Splitting only when `x > target` guarantees the minimal number of splits.

## 4. Complexity Analysis

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Sum & check | `O(n)` | `O(1)` |
| Sorting (or counting sort) | `O(n log n)` (or `O(n + 30)` with counting) | `O(n)` |
| Greedy loop | Each element is popped at most once and each split adds 2 new elements. The total number of elements processed ≤ `n + 2 * ops`. In the worst case `ops ≤ 30 * n` (since powers of two are ≤ 2³⁰). | `O(n)` (heap/array) |
| **Overall** | `O(n log n)` (or `O(n + 30)` with counting sort) | `O(n)` |

The solution easily satisfies the constraints (`n ≤ 1000`, values ≤ 2³⁰).

### Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minOperations(List<Integer> nums, int target) {
        long total = 0;
        for (int v : nums) total += v;

        if (total < target) return -1;          // impossible

        // Sort ascending
        Collections.sort(nums);
        int ops = 0;
        int idx = nums.size() - 1;             // largest element
        while (target > 0) {
            int x = nums.get(idx);
            idx--;                              // remove from end

            if (total - x >= target) {          // skip x
                total -= x;
            } else if (x <= target) {           // take x
                total -= x;
                target -= x;
            } else {                            // need to split
                ops++;
                int half = x >> 1;              // x / 2
                // push twice back
                // we push onto the end because array list is sorted ascending
                // so the new halves become the new largest elements
                nums.add(half);
                nums.add(half);
                // no need to adjust idx: we added at the end
                // but we must maintain sorted order: simple way is to use a PriorityQueue
            }
        }
        return ops;
    }
}
```

> **Tip** – In production code you’d use a `PriorityQueue` (max‑heap) to avoid resorting after each split. The logic is identical.

### Python

```python
from typing import List
import bisect

def min_operations(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    total = sum(nums)
    if total < target:
        return -1

    # sort ascending; powers of two are small, so built‑in sort is fine
    nums.sort()
    ops = 0
    # use a list as a stack (largest element at the end)
    while target > 0:
        x = nums.pop()          # largest
        if total - x >= target:
            total -= x
        elif x <= target:
            total -= x
            target -= x
        else:                   # x > target -> split
            nums.append(x // 2)
            nums.append(x // 2)
            ops += 1
    return ops
```

### C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        long long total = 0;
        for (int v : nums) total += v;
        if (total < target) return -1;

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());   // ascending
        int ops = 0;
        // we will use a vector as a stack: largest element at back
        while (target > 0) {
            int x = nums.back(); nums.pop_back();
            if (total - x >= target) {
                total -= x;                 // skip x
            } else if (x <= target) {
                total -= x;
                target -= x;               // take x
            } else {                      // split needed
                nums.push_back(x >> 1);
                nums.push_back(x >> 1);
                ++ops;
            }
        }
        return ops;
    }
};
```

### 🚀 Blog Article

> **Java, Python, and C++ solutions that you can drop into your interview notes.**

### Why this problem is an interview gold‑mine

* It blends number theory (powers of two) with greedy reasoning.  
* It forces you to think about “total sum is invariant” – a classic interview twist.  
* The “big‑to‑small” greedy is both intuitive and provably optimal, so you can explain it with confidence.  

---

### Problem Recap

> *Given* `nums` – an array of non‑negative powers of two.  
> *Goal* – after any number of splits, contain a subsequence summing to `target`.  
> *Split operation* – replace a number `x > 1` by two copies of `x/2`.  

If `sum(nums) < target` → impossible, because the split operation never changes the total sum.

If `sum(nums) >= target` → a solution **always exists**. In the extreme, splitting everything until you have `sum(nums)` ones allows you to reach any smaller sum.

---

### Good: The Greedy “Big‑to‑Small” Approach

1. **Minimal Splits**  
   We only split a number when it is *strictly larger* than the remaining target and all smaller numbers cannot satisfy it.  
   Splitting larger numbers first means we never waste operations on numbers that could be ignored.

2. **Simple & Efficient**  
   After sorting once, the rest is a linear scan with occasional splits.  
   Each split adds two new numbers, but the total number of processed items is bounded by the value range (`≤ 2³⁰`).

3. **Robust with `long` / `int64`**  
   Using a 64‑bit integer for the running total prevents overflow when summing up to 1 000 elements of size up to `2³⁰`.

4. **Extensible**  
   Replace the sorted array with a priority queue (max‑heap) if you need an *online* variant.

### Bad: Things to Watch Out For

| Potential Pitfall | Mitigation |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Integer overflow** | Use `long` in Java and `long long` in C++. |
| **Repeated splits blowing up the array** | In the worst case the number of splits is bounded by `30 * n`, which is still trivial for `n ≤ 1000`. |
| **Unsorted input** | Sorting or counting‑sort is mandatory; otherwise the greedy rule fails. |

---

### Ugly: Edge‑Case Hiding

| Case | Why it’s ugly | How our algorithm handles it |
|------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| All elements are `1` and target < `sum(nums)` | You may think you need to split, but you actually don’t. Our algorithm skips splits because each `x ≤ target`. |
| A huge element (`2³⁰`) and tiny target (`1`) | The algorithm splits `2³⁰` down to `1` via 30 splits – still minimal. |
| Target equals the total sum | No splits needed; the algorithm will never enter the split branch. |

---

### What Makes This a Great Interview Talking‑Point?

* **Intuition first, code second** – you can walk through the greedy rule before showing the implementation.  
* **Time & space trade‑offs** – discuss `O(n log n)` vs. `O(n+30)` counting sort.  
* **Proof of optimality** – the key lemma: “skip the largest element if the remaining sum still reaches the target” – this is easy to state and easy to convince the interviewer of its correctness.  
* **Language‑agnostic** – you can present the Java, Python, or C++ version with equal confidence.

## 7. FAQ & Edge‑Cases

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **What if `target = 0`?** | By definition a subsequence of length `0` sums to `0`. Return `0` immediately. |
| **What if `target = sum(nums)`?** | No operation is needed. Return `0`. |
| **Why can we always find a solution when total ≥ target?** | Splitting until all numbers are `1` produces an array of length `total`. Any integer between `1` and `total` can be written as a sum of some of those `1`s. |
| **Can we run into an infinite loop?** | No. Each loop iteration either removes an element or replaces it by two smaller elements. Because the elements are powers of two, the total number of possible splits is bounded. |
| **Is a `PriorityQueue` necessary?** | Not for the given constraints; an array after sorting is enough. A priority queue only makes the code a bit cleaner if you want an online solution. |
| **Does the algorithm depend on the fact that all numbers are powers of two?** | Yes – we rely on the halving property. If arbitrary integers were allowed, a different strategy would be required. |
