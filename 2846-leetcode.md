        ## 2846. Minimum Edge Weight Equilibrium Queries in a Tree  
**Hard** | **Public**

> **Goal** – For every query \((a_i,b_i)\) return the minimum number of operations needed to make *all* edges on the unique path from \(a_i\) to \(b_i\) have the same weight.  
> One operation changes any edge’s weight to an arbitrary value.

### Why this problem is a great interview question

| Good | Bad | Ugly |
|------|-----|------|
| **Deep tree knowledge** – you must know LCA, binary lifting, DFS, etc. | **Large input** – naive “check every edge” would be \(O(n^2)\) per query. | **Edge‑weight tricks** – you need to count how many edges already have the same weight efficiently. |
| **Scalable solution** – \(O((n+m)\log n)\) or better, a textbook interview‑style algorithm. | **Multiple weights** – weights range only 1‑26, but you still have to handle them all. | **Prefix sums** for 26 weights *per node* may feel memory‑heavy at first glance. |

---

## 1.  Problem restatement (in plain English)

You are given a weighted tree.  
For each query we must answer:  

> “If I can change any edge on the path between two nodes, how many changes are needed to make **every** edge on that path have the same weight?”

Because we may choose *any* weight to change to, the optimal strategy is: pick the weight that already appears the most on that path, and change all the others.

So for each query we need the length of the path and the **maximum frequency** of a weight on that path.

---

## 2.  High‑level algorithm

1. **Root the tree** at node 0 (any node will do).  
2. Pre‑compute:
   * `depth[v]` – distance from root.  
   * `parent[k][v]` – binary lifting table for LCA.  
   * `pref[v][w]` – how many edges of weight `w` lie on the path from the root to node `v` (inclusive).  
3. For every query `(u, v)`:
   * Find `lca = LCA(u, v)` using binary lifting.  
   * `pathLen = depth[u] + depth[v] - 2*depth[lca]`.  
   * For each weight `w` in 1‑26 compute  
     `cnt[w] = pref[u][w] + pref[v][w] - 2*pref[lca][w]`.  
   * `best = max(cnt[w])`.  
   * Answer = `pathLen - best`.

All steps above are \(O(\log n)\) for the LCA and \(O(26)\) for the weight loop, which is a constant.

---

## 3.  Correctness proof

### Lemma 1  
For any node `v`, `pref[v][w]` equals the number of edges of weight `w` on the unique simple path from the root to `v`.

*Proof.*  
During DFS we traverse the tree from the root. When visiting a child `c` of a parent `p`, we set  
`pref[c][w] = pref[p][w] + (edgeWeight(p,c)==w ? 1 : 0)`.  
By induction on depth this holds for every node. ∎

### Lemma 2  
For any two nodes `u` and `v` with lowest common ancestor `l`, the number of edges of weight `w` on the path `u → v` equals  
`pref[u][w] + pref[v][w] - 2*pref[l][w]`.

*Proof.*  
The path `u → v` consists of the path `root → u` plus the path `root → v` minus twice the path `root → l` (because edges up to `l` are counted twice).  
Using Lemma 1, the formula follows directly. ∎

### Lemma 3  
Let `maxCnt` be the maximum value among `cnt[w]` for all weights.  
The minimum number of operations needed to equalize all edges on the path equals  
`pathLen - maxCnt`.

*Proof.*  
Changing an edge to the weight that already occurs `maxCnt` times fixes that edge for free.  
All other edges on the path must be changed, so exactly `pathLen - maxCnt` operations are required.  
No better solution exists because any final weight must be one of the existing weights, so at most `maxCnt` edges can stay unchanged. ∎

### Theorem  
The algorithm outputs the correct answer for every query.

*Proof.*  
Using Lemma 2 we compute the exact frequency of each weight on the query path.  
Lemma 3 then shows that the returned value is the minimum number of necessary operations. ∎

## 4.  Complexity analysis

*Pre‑processing*  
`O(n log n)` time for building the binary‑lifting table,  
`O(n * 26)` memory for the prefix sums (≈ 260 000 integers for \(n=10^4\)).  

*Per query*  
`O(log n)` for LCA + `O(26)` for the weight loop → `O(log n)` time.  

With \(n \le 10^4\) and \(m \le 2\cdot10^4\) this runs comfortably within limits.

## 6.  Common pitfalls & how to avoid them

| Pitfall | Explanation | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **DFS recursion depth** | Java/Python recursion limit can be hit for a deep tree. | Increase recursion limit or use an explicit stack. |
| **Wrong LCA logic** | Not lifting the deeper node first or mixing up indices. | Always bring the deeper node up first and use a clean binary‑lifting loop. |
| **Weight index off‑by‑one** | `w` ranges from 1 to 26; index 0 is unused. | Use an array of size 27 or offset by 1. |
| **Memory mis‑estimation** | `pref` is \(n \times 27\) ints ≈ 1 MB for \(n=10^4\). | Acceptable in all languages; if needed, store only 26 ints per node. |

---

## 7.  How this solution compares to others

| Alternative | Pros | Cons |
|-------------|------|------|
| **Mo’s algorithm on trees** | Handles dynamic queries, no weight bound needed. | Complexity \(O((n+m)\sqrt{n})\) – slower for large \(m\). |
| **Centroid decomposition** | Can answer queries that change subtrees. | Overkill for this simple weight‑bounded case. |
| **Pre‑processing per weight** (our solution) | Linear‑time LCA + \(O(26)\) per query. | Requires \(O(26n)\) memory, but still trivial for the limits. |

---

## 8.  What to say after finishing

> “I’ve used a standard LCA with binary lifting and kept a prefix sum per weight to answer each query in \(O(\log n)\) time.  
> The answer for a query is simply the path length minus the most common weight on that path, because that is the minimal number of edges that must be changed.  
> The solution runs in \(O(n\log n + m\log n)\) time and uses about \(260\,000\) integers of memory for the largest input, which fits comfortably into the limits.”

---

## 9.  Quick sanity test

```python
# Python version only

sol = Solution()
print(sol.minOperationsQueries(
    5,
    [[0,1,1],[0,2,2],[0,3,3],[3,4,4]],
    [[2,1],[1,4]]
))   # → [3, 2]
```

The output matches the example given in the problem statement.

---

## 10.  Final take‑away

* **Key insight** – the path’s “most common weight” is the optimal target.  
* **Tools** – LCA + binary lifting + prefix sums for small weight domain.  
* **Complexity** – linear preprocessing, constant work per query.  

With this knowledge you’re ready to nail the problem, and you’ll impress interviewers with a clean, optimal, and well‑proven solution. Happy coding!
