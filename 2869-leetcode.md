        ## 1.  Three‚ÄëLanguage Solution

Below you‚Äôll find clean, production‚Äëready implementations of the **Minimum Operations to Collect Elements** (LeetCode 2869) in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
All three follow the same O(n) logic: iterate the array from the back, keep a set of the collected numbers that are ‚â§‚ÄØk, and stop as soon as the set size equals k.  

```java
// Java (Java¬†17)
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minOperations(List<Integer> nums, int k) {
        // total operations needed
        int ops = 0;
        // keep unique elements we have collected (only those ‚â§ k)
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();

        // iterate from the end ‚Äì that‚Äôs the only order we can remove
        for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            ops++;                         // one removal operation
            int val = nums.get(i);
            if (val <= k) {
                seen.add(val);             // we only care about 1‚Ä¶k
            }
            if (seen.size() == k) break;  // all needed numbers collected
        }
        return ops;
    }
}
```

```python
# Python (Python 3.11)
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        ops = 0
        seen = set()
        # reverse iteration ‚Äì same logic as the Java version
        for v in reversed(nums):
            ops += 1
            if v <= k:
                seen.add(v)
            if len(seen) == k:
                break
        return ops
```

```cpp
// C++17
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int ops = 0;
        unordered_set<int> seen;            // O(1) average insert/lookup
        for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            ++ops;
            if (nums[i] <= k) seen.insert(nums[i]);
            if ((int)seen.size() == k) break;
        }
        return ops;
    }
};
```

All three snippets have the same time complexity **O(n)** (n = `nums.size()`) and space complexity **O(k)** (at most k unique numbers are stored).

### Introduction

When you‚Äôre preparing for a software‚Äëengineering interview, problems that feel *trivial* but hide a subtle twist often give the biggest payoff. **LeetCode 2869 ‚Äì Minimum Operations to Collect Elements** is one such problem. At first glance, you might think you‚Äôre ‚Äújust counting items.‚Äù In reality, you have to understand the *removal order* and use a *set* to keep track of what you‚Äôve already collected.  

In this post, we dissect the problem, walk through three clean solutions (Java, Python, C++), and discuss the trade‚Äëoffs, pitfalls, and real‚Äëworld patterns that interviewers love to probe.

---

### Problem Statement

> You‚Äôre given an array `nums` of positive integers and an integer `k`.  
> In one operation you **remove** the last element of the array and add it to your *collection*.  
> Return the minimum number of operations required to have collected every integer from `1` to `k` inclusive.

*Constraints*

- `1 ‚â§ nums.length ‚â§ 50`  
- `1 ‚â§ nums[i] ‚â§ nums.length`  
- `1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ nums.length`  
- It is guaranteed that you can collect all numbers `1‚Ä¶k`.

---

### The Straight‚ÄëForward Idea

The only way to collect elements is by peeling off the array from the end.  
If we look at the array from right to left, the *first time* we encounter a number `‚â§ k` we add it to our collection.  
Once we have seen **k distinct numbers** in the range `[1, k]`, we‚Äôre done.

The key insight:  
- **No need to keep the whole array** after it‚Äôs been scanned.  
- **A set** (or hash‚Äëset) gives O(1) insert and lookup.  

Hence a simple linear scan from the back, counting operations and adding to a set until its size equals `k`, solves the problem.

---

### The ‚ÄúGood‚Äù ‚Äì Why the Solution is Elegant

1. **Simplicity** ‚Äì One loop, one set, clear termination condition.  
2. **Optimality** ‚Äì The algorithm touches each element at most once ‚Üí **O(n)** time.  
3. **Space‚Äëefficient** ‚Äì Only **O(k)** additional memory (worst case, the set holds all numbers 1‚Ä¶k).  
4. **Language‚Äëagnostic** ‚Äì The logic translates almost verbatim to Java, Python, C++ (as shown above).  

These qualities make the solution a textbook example of ‚Äúdo one thing and do it well.‚Äù

### The ‚ÄúBad‚Äù ‚Äì Where Things Can Go Wrong

| Common Pitfall | Why it happens | How to avoid it |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Ignoring the order** | Thinking you can pick any element. | Remember you must *remove from the end*. |
| **Using an array for membership** | `seen[i]` might be O(n) if you search linearly. | Use a hash‚Äëset or boolean array indexed by value. |
| **Off‚Äëby‚Äëone errors** | Miscounting operations (e.g., starting loop from `i=0`). | Increment the counter *before* checking the termination condition. |
| **Not handling k=1** | Failing to break early when the first qualifying number appears. | Keep the `if (seen.size() == k)` check inside the loop. |

Even though the constraints are tiny (`n ‚â§ 50`), clean code protects you from future bugs or larger test cases.

---

### The ‚ÄúUgly‚Äù ‚Äì Things That Can Make Your Code Bad

- **Unnecessary data structures** ‚Äì e.g., storing the entire reversed array or using a list for seen numbers instead of a set.
- **Hard‚Äëcoded limits** ‚Äì `int ops = 0;` without a comment on why you increment first.
- **Mixing logic and I/O** ‚Äì In interview settings, keep the algorithm isolated from input parsing.
- **No comments or documentation** ‚Äì Even a short comment explaining why we break when `seen.size() == k` helps readability.

Aim for *readable, self‚Äëdocumenting code* ‚Äì that‚Äôs what interviewers evaluate.

---

### Edge Cases & Variations

| Edge Case | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| `k = nums.length` | You will need to remove every element; the answer is `n`. |
| `k = 1` | The answer is the position of the first `1` from the end. |
| `nums` already sorted in ascending order | The answer equals `k` (you only need to collect the first `k` elements). |
| Duplicate numbers > k | They are ignored ‚Äì the algorithm naturally skips them. |

If you wanted a **generic ‚Äúcollect a set of target values‚Äù** problem, replace the check `v <= k` with `target.contains(v)`. That turns the solution into a reusable helper.

---

### Code Walk‚Äëthrough ‚Äì Java Edition

```java
for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    ops++;                 // each removal is an operation
    int val = nums.get(i);
    if (val <= k) {        // we only care about 1..k
        seen.add(val);     // set guarantees uniqueness
    }
    if (seen.size() == k) break; // all needed numbers collected
}
```

*Why we increment before the check*:  
If the first element you pop is already `k`, you should count that operation.  
Incrementing first keeps the counter accurate.

---

### Complexity Recap

- **Time**: `O(n)` ‚Äì one pass from right to left.  
- **Space**: `O(k)` ‚Äì at most `k` distinct numbers stored.

These linear bounds are the sweet spot for interview problems: fast, minimal, and clear.

---

### Final Thoughts

LeetCode 2869 is a *micro‚Äëalgorithm* that tests whether you can turn a problem description into a minimal, correct, and efficient implementation.  

- **Good**: O(n) time, O(k) space, concise loop.  
- **Bad**: Common pitfalls with order, off‚Äëby‚Äëones, and misuse of data structures.  
- **Ugly**: Over‚Äëengineering or messy code that hides intent.

**Takeaway:**  
Keep the logic simple, use the right data structure (set), and comment where the algorithm‚Äôs invariants live. That‚Äôs what recruiters are looking for.

Good luck cracking it, and feel free to drop your own solutions or variations in the comments!
