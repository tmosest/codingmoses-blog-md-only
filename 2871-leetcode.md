        ## 1️⃣ Solution Overview  

**Problem**  
Given an array `nums` (0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁶), split it into contiguous sub‑arrays so that

* each element belongs to exactly one sub‑array,
* the sum of the bitwise‑AND scores of all sub‑arrays is **minimum possible**,
* the number of sub‑arrays is **maximal** among all splits that achieve that minimum sum.

Return that maximal number of sub‑arrays.

**Observation**  
The score of a sub‑array is the bitwise AND of all its elements.  
`x & y ≤ x` and `x & y ≤ y`, therefore the score of any sub‑array is **never larger** than the score of the whole array.  
If the score of the entire array is `> 0`, no sub‑array can have a score `0`; splitting can only increase the total score.  
Thus the only interesting case is when the global score is `0`. In that case we can split arbitrarily as long as each split has score `0`.

**Greedy One‑Pass**  
Traverse the array keeping a running AND (`cur`).  
* Whenever `cur` becomes `0`, we can end a sub‑array here – its score is `0`.  
  We reset `cur` to “all‑ones” (`-1` in two’s‑complement) and continue.
* At the end we will have counted all zero‑score splits.  
  If none were found (`ans == 0`) we must return `1` because the whole array is one sub‑array.

This greedy strategy is optimal:  
* Every time `cur` becomes `0` we are forced to include the current element in the current sub‑array; otherwise the next element would still keep the AND non‑zero and we could not finish a sub‑array earlier.  
* Splitting earlier can never decrease the total score (it stays `0`) and always increases the number of sub‑arrays.

**Complexities**  
*Time*: `O(n)` – one pass through the array.  
*Space*: `O(1)` – only a few integer variables.

## 2️⃣ Code Implementation

### 📌 Java

```java
// LeetCode 2871: Split Array Into Maximum Number of Subarrays
class Solution {
    public int maxSubarrays(int[] nums) {
        int cur = -1;          // all‑ones (bitwise complement of 0)
        int answer = 0;

        for (int val : nums) {
            cur &= val;        // running AND
            if (cur == 0) {    // finished a zero‑score sub‑array
                answer++;
                cur = -1;      // reset to all‑ones
            }
        }
        // If no split was possible, the whole array is one sub‑array
        return answer == 0 ? 1 : answer;
    }
}
```

### 📌 Python

```python
# LeetCode 2871: Split Array Into Maximum Number of Subarrays
class Solution:
    def maxSubarrays(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        cur = -1          # all‑ones mask
        ans = 0

        for val in nums:
            cur &= val
            if cur == 0:
                ans += 1
                cur = -1

        return 1 if ans == 0 else ans
```

### 📌 C++

```cpp
// LeetCode 2871: Split Array Into Maximum Number of Subarrays
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubarrays(vector<int>& nums) {
        int cur = -1;          // all‑ones
        int ans = 0;

        for (int val : nums) {
            cur &= val;
            if (cur == 0) {    // zero‑score sub‑array found
                ++ans;
                cur = -1;     // reset
            }
        }
        return ans == 0 ? 1 : ans;
    }
};
```

> **Title**  
> *“The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly of Splitting Arrays by Bitwise AND – A Practical Guide for Job‑Seeking Developers”*

### 3.1  Why This Problem Matters for Your Portfolio

- **Bitwise operations** are a staple in interviews (especially at FAANG). Mastering them shows you understand low‑level data manipulation.
- **Greedy algorithms** are a classic interview theme. This problem blends bitwise logic with a greedy strategy—an attractive combination for recruiters.
- The solution is *O(n) time* and *O(1) space*, a perfect example of an “efficient algorithm” that will impress hiring managers.

### 3.2  The Good – What You’ll Learn

| Concept | Why It’s Good | How It Helps You |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| **Bitwise AND Properties** | `x & y ≤ x` and `x & y ≤ y`. | You’ll know when AND can only reduce values, a key insight for many bit‑level problems. |
| **Greedy One‑Pass** | You can decide in a single pass whether to split. | Demonstrates the ability to convert a seemingly complex problem into a linear scan. |
| **Edge‑Case Handling** | Return `1` if no split is possible. | Shows attention to detail, a trait highly valued in production code. |
| **Space Optimization** | Uses only a couple of integer variables. | Highlights clean, memory‑efficient coding—something recruiters love to see. |

### 3.3  The Bad – Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Example Mistake | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Assuming you can split at every zero AND** | Treating every element that makes the running AND zero as an independent split. | Remember to **reset** the running AND to all‑ones (`-1`) after counting a split. |
| **Ignoring the “no‑split” case** | Returning `0` when the array cannot be split into a zero‑score sub‑array. | Return `1` as the minimum number of sub‑arrays. |
| **Using a non‑bitwise‑AND operation** | Using `+` or `*` instead of `&` inside the loop. | Always use `&=` for a running AND. |
| **Misunderstanding integer sign** | Confusing `-1` (all‑ones) with `0`. | In two’s‑complement, `-1` is `111…111`, which is the identity for bitwise AND. |

### 3.4  The Ugly – Overengineering and What to Avoid

| Ugly Practice | Why It’s Ugly | Better Approach |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Pre‑computing prefix AND arrays** | Requires `O(n)` additional memory, unnecessary for this greedy solution. | Keep a single running AND variable. |
| **Recursive backtracking** | Exponential time, not scalable for `n = 10⁵`. | Use the greedy one‑pass strategy. |
| **Using BigInteger for bitwise AND** | Adds overhead, loses performance advantage. | Stick to primitive types (`int`). |
| **Ignoring the “all‑ones” trick** | Resetting to `0` instead of `-1` can cause logic errors. | Use `-1` (all‑ones) to reset. |

### 3.5  Final Thoughts

This problem is a micro‑ecosystem of algorithmic concepts:

1. **Bitwise algebra** – understand how AND behaves.
2. **Greedy reasoning** – can we split immediately when the AND hits zero?
3. **Edge‑case mindfulness** – what if the entire array is already minimal?

By mastering this, you not only nail a LeetCode question but also demonstrate a versatile mindset that recruiters value.  

**Pro tip for job applications**:  
- Include this solution in your GitHub repo under a clear folder (e.g., `Algorithms/LeetCode/2871`).  
- Add a README explaining the greedy approach, complexity, and potential extensions (e.g., for other bitwise operations).  
- Mention that the same technique can be adapted to problems like “maximum subarray sum with OR” or “minimum number of segments with XOR = 0”.

## 4️⃣ Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

| Step | Action | Code Snippet |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Initialize running AND to all‑ones | `int cur = -1;` |
| 2 | Iterate over array | `for (int val : nums)` |
| 3 | Update running AND | `cur &= val;` |
| 4 | Check for zero AND | `if (cur == 0) { ... }` |
| 5 | Reset after split | `cur = -1;` |
| 6 | Count splits | `answer++;` |
| 7 | Final answer | `return answer == 0 ? 1 : answer;` |

### 📌 Takeaway for the Interviewer

> **“When the score of the whole array is zero, we can greedily cut every time the running AND becomes zero; if the score is positive, the only possible split is the whole array. The algorithm is linear and constant‑space.”**

Feel confident explaining this logic, and you’ll showcase your ability to blend theory with clean, production‑ready code—exactly what hiring managers look for. Happy coding! 🚀
