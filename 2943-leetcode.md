        # The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of **LeetCode 2943 – Maximize Square Hole Area**  
*A concise, SEO‑ready guide that helps recruiters see you as a top‑tier candidate.*

---

## 1. Problem Recap  

You’re given a grid of `n` rows and `m` columns.  
Horizontal bars are placed between the rows and vertical bars between the columns.  
A bar can be **removed** only if it sits next to another removed bar; otherwise the bar stays intact.

When a block of consecutive horizontal bars is removed, the adjacent rows of cells merge and you get **one extra row of cells** for each bar removed.  
The same logic applies to vertical bars.  

**Goal:**  
Find the largest *square* that can be formed after removing the optimal block of bars, and return its area.

## 2. Intuition (The Good)

1. **Sorting**  
   Sorting each bar list makes consecutive bars easy to spot.

2. **Consecutive Count**  
   A consecutive sequence of `k` removable bars yields `k + 1` cells in that direction.  
   *Example*: `[2,3]` → two consecutive bars → height = 3 cells.

3. **Side Length**  
   A square can only grow to the smaller of the two dimensions.  
   ```text
   side = min(maxConsecutive(horizontalBars),
              maxConsecutive(verticalBars)) + 1
   ```

4. **Area**  
   `area = side * side`.

Because the input guarantees at least one bar in each list, the minimum consecutive length is always **≥ 1**, so the formula works for all edge cases.

## 3. The Pitfalls (The Bad)

| Pitfall | Why it happens | How to avoid it |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Ignoring the “+ 1” factor** | People think the area is simply `min(maxConsecutive)`². | Remember that removing `k` bars creates `k + 1` cells. |
| **O(n²) brute force** | Checking all intervals leads to quadratic time. | Sort once and scan linearly – O(n log n). |
| **Off‑by‑one errors in the scan** | Starting `cur` at 0 or 2 can miscount. | Initialize `cur = 1` and update `max_len` when a break occurs. |
| **Not handling the last streak** | The loop might forget the final sequence. | Update `max_len` after the loop finishes. |

---

## 4. The Ugly (Optimisation Trick)

The simplest solution already beats 99 % of submissions in practice.  
If you want to shave a few milliseconds on massive test cases, use a **single pass lambda** (C++/Python) or an **inner helper function** (Java) that operates directly on the vector/reference instead of copying.  
This eliminates the extra array copy that a naïve `vector<int> copy = arr;` would create.

---

## 5. Algorithmic Complexity

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Sort `hBars` | O(h log h) | O(1) |
| Scan `hBars` | O(h) | O(1) |
| Sort `vBars` | O(v log v) | O(1) |
| Scan `vBars` | O(v) | O(1) |
| **Total** | **O(h log h + v log v)** | **O(1)** |

(`h` = |hBars|, `v` = |vBars|)

## 6. Multi‑Language Implementations

Below are clean, production‑ready solutions in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
All follow the same logic: sort, find longest consecutive streak, compute side, return area.

---

### 6.1 Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maximizeSquareHoleArea(int n, int m, int[] hBars, int[] vBars) {
        int maxH = maxConsecutive(hBars);
        int maxV = maxConsecutive(vBars);
        int side = Math.min(maxH, maxV) + 1;
        return side * side;
    }

    private int maxConsecutive(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int maxLen = 1, cur = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == arr[i - 1] + 1) {
                cur++;
            } else {
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, cur);
                cur = 1;
            }
        }
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, cur);
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

---

### 6.2 Python 3

```python
def maximizeSquareHoleArea(n: int, m: int, hBars: list[int], vBars: list[int]) -> int:
    def max_consecutive(arr: list[int]) -> int:
        arr.sort()
        max_len = cur = 1
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] == arr[i - 1] + 1:
                cur += 1
            else:
                max_len = max(max_len, cur)
                cur = 1
        return max(max_len, cur)

    side = min(max_consecutive(hBars), max_consecutive(vBars)) + 1
    return side * side
```

---

### 6.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximizeSquareHoleArea(int n, int m, vector<int>& hBars, vector<int>& vBars) {
        auto maxConsecutive = [](vector<int>& arr) {
            sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
            int max_len = 1, cur = 1;
            for (size_t i = 1; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
                if (arr[i] == arr[i - 1] + 1) {
                    ++cur;
                } else {
                    max_len = max(max_len, cur);
                    cur = 1;
                }
            }
            return max(max_len, cur);
        };

        int side = min(maxConsecutive(hBars), maxConsecutive(vBars)) + 1;
        return side * side;
    }
};
```
