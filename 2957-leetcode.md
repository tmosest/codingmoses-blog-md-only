        ## 1.  Problem Recap

**LeetCode 2957 – Remove Adjacent Almost‑Equal Characters**  
*Difficulty: Medium*  

Given a 0‑indexed string `word` (length ≤ 100, all lowercase English letters), you may **change** any character to any other lowercase letter in a single operation.  
Two characters are *almost‑equal* if they are equal **or** adjacent in the alphabet (`|a – b| ≤ 1`).  

**Goal** – find the minimum number of operations needed so that **no** adjacent pair of characters in the final string is almost‑equal.

---

## 2.  Intuition & Greedy Solution

When we scan the string from left to right, the only problematic situation is when the current character `word[i]` is almost‑equal to the previous one `word[i‑1]`.  

If that happens we **must** change `word[i]`.  
Why can we change it without caring about the rest of the string?  
Because there are 26 letters – we can always pick a letter that is **not** almost‑equal to *both* its neighbors (previous and next).  
So we change `word[i]` to any such letter and then **skip** checking the next character (`i+1`).  
Why? Because `word[i]` has been changed to something that is guaranteed to be safe with respect to `word[i+1]`.  
Hence the next potential conflict starts at `i+2`.

This yields a simple **single‑pass** algorithm:

```
count = 0
i = 1
while i < n:
    if |word[i] - word[i-1]| ≤ 1:
        count += 1          # one operation
        i += 2              # skip next char
    else:
        i += 1
return count
```

Time complexity: **O(n)**  
Space complexity: **O(1)**

## 3.  Reference Implementations

### 3.1 Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public int removeAlmostEqualCharacters(String word) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < word.length(); ) {
            if (Math.abs(word.charAt(i) - word.charAt(i - 1)) <= 1) {
                count++;   // we will change word[i]
                i += 2;    // skip the next character
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def removeAlmostEqualCharacters(self, word: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        i = 1
        n = len(word)
        while i < n:
            if abs(ord(word[i]) - ord(word[i - 1])) <= 1:
                count += 1
                i += 2          # skip the next character
            else:
                i += 1
        return count
```

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeAlmostEqualCharacters(string word) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < (int)word.size(); ) {
            if (abs(word[i] - word[i - 1]) <= 1) {
                ++count;   // change word[i]
                i += 2;    // skip next char
            } else {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

All three codes run in **O(n)** time, use **O(1)** extra space, and match the expected answer on LeetCode.

### 4.1  The Problem in a Nutshell

You're handed a string of lowercase letters.  
You can change any letter to any other letter, one operation at a time.  
After all changes, no two consecutive letters should be the same or alphabetically adjacent.  
Return the minimal number of changes.

---

### 4.2  Why This Problem Feels Hard

- The input size is tiny (≤ 100), but that *doesn't* mean brute force is the way to go; interviewers expect a clear, optimal solution.
- At first glance, it looks like a **dynamic programming** or **graph** problem.
- You might try to think of every possible replacement for each character, leading to exponential blow‑up.

---

### 4.3  The Good – A Simple Greedy Insight

The key observation is:

> **If two adjacent characters are almost‑equal, we *must* change the right one.**

Why?  
Because we cannot keep both as they violate the rule.  
And since we can choose any letter for the right character, we can pick one that will not conflict with *its* right neighbor.  

**Thus the greedy rule is:**
- Scan from left to right.
- Whenever you hit a conflict, increment the counter, change the current character (conceptually), and skip the next index.

This guarantees that each change resolves one conflict and never introduces a new one that we would have missed.  
The algorithm is **O(n)** and **O(1)**, perfect for the interview.

### 4.4  The Bad – Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Why it fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Skipping too far** | Skipping only the next index (`i += 1`) can leave a conflict between the changed character and the next one. | Skip two indices (`i += 2`) because we just changed `word[i]`. |
| **Over‑changing** | Changing a character when its left neighbor is *not* almost‑equal wastes operations. | Only change when `|cur - prev| ≤ 1`. |
| **Edge‑case bugs** | Forgetting to check bounds when skipping can cause `IndexOutOfBounds`. | Use a `while` loop with a safe bound (`i < n`). |
| **Confusing “almost‑equal”** | Mistaking “adjacent in alphabet” for “same” only. | Use `abs(a - b) ≤ 1` (or `a == b || a+1==b || a-1==b`). |

---

### 4.5  The Ugly – Trying the Wrong Data Structure

- **Linked list/Queue**: Overkill, adds complexity, and slows you down.
- **DP Table**: `dp[i][state]` for each possible character at position `i` is unnecessary because we never need to remember the actual changed character—only that we changed it.
- **Recursive DFS**: Exponential time and stack overflow risk for length 100.

Stick to the greedy pass; it’s the *cleanest* solution.

---

### 4.6  Code Walk‑through (Java)

```java
public class Solution {
    public int removeAlmostEqualCharacters(String word) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < word.length(); ) {
            // conflict?  (almost‑equal)
            if (Math.abs(word.charAt(i) - word.charAt(i - 1)) <= 1) {
                ++count;   // we will change word[i]
                i += 2;    // skip the next index
            } else {
                ++i;       // no change needed
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

**Explanation**  
- The `for` loop is intentionally left without `i++` in the increment section.  
- `Math.abs(...) ≤ 1` captures “equal or adjacent”.  
- `i += 2` means “after changing the current character, the character we just changed is guaranteed safe with its right neighbor”.

### 4.7  Final Thoughts – How to Nail This in a FAANG Interview

1. **State your intuition first**: “When I see an almost‑equal pair, I have to change the right one.”  
2. **Write a concise loop**; you’re showing that you understand time/space constraints.  
3. **Talk through edge cases** (first/last character, string length 1).  
4. **Discuss alternatives** briefly and explain why greedy is optimal.  

By mastering LeetCode 2957 you’ll demonstrate:
- **Problem‑solving mindset**  
- **OOP & functional style** (Java, Python, C++)  
- **Space‑time trade‑off awareness**  
- **Interview communication skills**

These are exactly the traits recruiters look for in candidates for **FAANG** (Amazon, Google, Apple, Netflix, Facebook) and other high‑growth tech roles.

- **Time**: `O(n)`  
- **Space**: `O(1)`
- **Avoid over‑engineering**: No DP, no data‑structure gymnastics.
