        ## 📌 LeetCode 2979 – *Most Expensive Item That Can Not Be Bought*  
### A one‑liner that rocks the interview room

### 1️⃣ Problem Recap

Two distinct prime numbers `primeOne` and `primeTwo` are given.  
Alice owns an infinite number of coins of denominations `primeOne` and `primeTwo`.  
For every positive integer price `x` there is an item that costs `x`.  
The task: **Return the price of the most expensive item that Alice cannot buy**.

> **Constraints**  
> • `1 < primeOne, primeTwo < 10^4`  
> • `primeOne`, `primeTwo` are primes (hence coprime)  
> • `primeOne * primeTwo < 10^5`

### 2️⃣ “Good, Bad & Ugly” – What You Should Know

| Aspect | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Bad | 😱 Ugly |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Math insight** | *Frobenius Coin Problem* for two coprime denominations → `ab – a – b`. | You might think you need DP for every value up to the product. | Trying to brute‑force all combinations will lead to TLE and stack‑overflow. |
| **Time complexity** | `O(1)` – just a multiplication and subtraction. | DP approach would be `O(ab)` which is unnecessary. | Recursive DFS without memo can explode in recursion depth. |
| **Memory usage** | `O(1)` – a couple of integers. | DP would need an array of size `ab`. | Recursive stack space for deep recursion. |
| **Edge cases** | None – primes > 1, coprime. | None – formula is exact. | Forgetting that the numbers are primes → using `gcd(a,b)` > 1 would break the formula. |

### 3️⃣ The Math Behind the One‑Liner

The *Chicken McNugget Theorem* (also called the Frobenius coin problem) states:

> For two coprime positive integers `a` and `b`, the largest integer that **cannot** be expressed as `ax + by` (with `x, y ≥ 0`) is `ab - a - b`.

Since `primeOne` and `primeTwo` are distinct primes, they are coprime.  
Hence the answer is:

```
most_expensive = primeOne * primeTwo - primeOne - primeTwo
```

That’s it. No loops, no DP, no recursion.

### 4️⃣ Code Snippets

> ⚡️ *All solutions run in O(1) time and O(1) memory.*

#### 🟦 Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int mostExpensiveItem(int primeOne, int primeTwo) {
        return primeOne * primeTwo - primeOne - primeTwo;
    }
}
```

#### 🟨 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def mostExpensiveItem(self, primeOne: int, primeTwo: int) -> int:
        return primeOne * primeTwo - primeOne - primeTwo
```

#### 🟧 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mostExpensiveItem(int primeOne, int primeTwo) {
        return primeOne * primeTwo - primeOne - primeTwo;
    }
};
```

### 5️⃣ Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Time   | `O(1)` – constant arithmetic operations |
| Memory | `O(1)` – no extra containers or recursion stack |

Because the product `primeOne * primeTwo` is bounded by `10^5`, the intermediate result comfortably fits inside a 32‑bit signed integer.

### 6️⃣ Why This Matters for Your Interview

1. **Showcase mathematical fluency** – LeetCode often hides a simple math trick behind a seemingly complex DP problem.  
2. **Highlight optimization mindset** – Spotting the Frobenius formula reduces a `O(ab)` DP to `O(1)`.  
3. **Demonstrate clean coding** – One clear line, no boilerplate, no risk of overflow (within constraints).

These are precisely the qualities recruiters love.

---

### 7️⃣ TL;DR

> For two distinct prime denominations `a` and `b`, the largest price that cannot be formed is `a * b – a – b`.  
> So just compute `primeOne * primeTwo - primeOne - primeTwo`.
