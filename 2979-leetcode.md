        ## üéØ Problem Overview ‚Äì ‚ÄúMost Expensive Item That Can Not Be Bought‚Äù

| LeetCode ID | 2979 |  
|-------------|------|  
| Difficulty  | Medium |  
| Tag         | Math, Number Theory |  

**Statement**  
You‚Äôre given two distinct prime numbers `primeOne` and `primeTwo`.  
You have an infinite amount of coins in those two denominations.  
For every positive integer `x` there is an item that costs `x`.  
Return the highest price of an item that **cannot** be paid exactly with any
combination of the two coins.

**Examples**

| `primeOne` | `primeTwo` | Output | Explanation |
|------------|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2 | 5 | 3 | Unbuyable prices: {1,3}. All >3 are buyable. |
| 5 | 7 | 23 | Unbuyable prices: {1,2,3,4,6,8,9,11,13,16,18,23}. All >23 are buyable. |

**Constraints**

* 1‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ`primeOne`, `primeTwo`‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ10‚Å¥  
* `primeOne` and `primeTwo` are prime  
* `primeOne`‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ`primeTwo`‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ10‚Åµ

## üîë Insight ‚Äì Chicken McNugget Theorem

When you have two coprime positive integers `a` and `b`, the largest integer that cannot be expressed as  
`a * x + b * y` with non‚Äënegative integers `x, y` is

```
maxNotRepresentable = a * b - a - b
```

Both primes are distinct, so they are automatically coprime.
Hence the answer is simply

```
primeOne * primeTwo - primeOne - primeTwo
```

No loops or DP are needed ‚Äì the solution runs in **O(1)** time and **O(1)** space.

### Introduction

When I first saw *LeetCode 2979 ‚Äì Most Expensive Item That Can Not Be Bought*, I assumed a dynamic‚Äëprogramming (DP) approach was inevitable: ‚ÄúWe have two coin denominations, can we compute all representable amounts?‚Äù  
But the constraints were tiny (`primeOne * primeTwo < 10‚Åµ`) and the test cases were simple.  
The real secret? A classic number‚Äëtheory result called the **Chicken McNugget Theorem**.

### The Good ‚Äì Why the Formula Works

1. **Coprime Primes** ‚Äì Any two distinct primes are coprime, i.e., `gcd(primeOne, primeTwo) == 1`.  
   This is the exact condition the theorem requires.

2. **Largest Unattainable Sum** ‚Äì The theorem tells us the largest integer that **cannot** be written as  
   `primeOne * x + primeTwo * y` (x, y ‚â• 0) is  
   `primeOne * primeTwo ‚Äì primeOne ‚Äì primeTwo`.

3. **Constant‚ÄëTime Answer** ‚Äì Once you know the formula, the answer is a single arithmetic operation.  
   That‚Äôs why all three solutions run in *O(1)* time.

---

### The Bad ‚Äì Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Off‚Äëby‚ÄëOne Errors** | Forgetting that the theorem applies to *positive* integers > 0. | Use `primeOne * primeTwo - primeOne - primeTwo`. |
| **Overflow (Java)** | `int` multiplication could overflow for larger primes (but constraints keep it safe). | Still safe because `primeOne * primeTwo < 10‚Åµ`. |
| **Misinterpreting ‚ÄúDistinct‚Äù** | Some people assume primes could be equal, which would break the coprime condition. | Problem guarantees they‚Äôre distinct. |

---

### The Ugly ‚Äì When You Don‚Äôt Know the Theorem

If you‚Äôre stuck and haven‚Äôt heard of the theorem, you might:

1. **Write a DP** that explores all sums up to `primeOne * primeTwo`.  
   Time: `O(n¬≤)` in the worst case (n ~ 10‚Åµ) ‚Üí ~10‚Åπ operations ‚Üí too slow.  

2. **Implement a BFS/DP with a Queue** that keeps adding `primeOne` and `primeTwo`.  
   Still ends up exploring ~10‚Åµ states, but it‚Äôs unnecessary.

3. **Trial‚Äëand‚ÄëError Enumeration** until you notice the pattern.  
   This wastes time and leads to flaky solutions that may fail hidden tests.

---

### Final Takeaway

The LeetCode 2979 problem is a textbook example of how a little math can turn a seemingly hard DP problem into a one‚Äëliner.  
Remember:

```
answer = primeOne * primeTwo - primeOne - primeTwo
```

Add this to your interview toolkit, and you‚Äôll impress interviewers with both your coding and mathematical chops!
