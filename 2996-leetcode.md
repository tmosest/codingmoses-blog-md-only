        ## 2996 – Smallest Missing Integer Greater Than Sequential Prefix Sum  
*Easy | 50 elements | 1‑50 values*

---

### 1. Problem Restatement

You’re given a 0‑indexed integer array `nums` (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 50).  
A **sequential prefix** is a prefix that starts at `nums[0]` and each subsequent element increases by 1, i.e.

```
nums[0], nums[0]+1, nums[0]+2, … , nums[i]
```

The **longest sequential prefix** is the prefix that satisfies this rule for the maximum possible `i`.  
Let `S` be the sum of all elements in that longest prefix.

**Goal**: Return the smallest integer `x` that

* `x` is **not** present in `nums`
* `x` ≥ `S`

The array length is tiny (≤ 50), but we’ll still aim for an O(N log N) solution that works in all three languages.

---

### 2. Intuition

1. **Find the longest sequential prefix**  
   Starting from `nums[0]`, keep adding numbers while each next element is exactly one larger.  
   Accumulate the sum while doing this.

2. **Determine the smallest missing integer ≥ S**  
   The natural way is to look at all numbers that are present in `nums`.  
   If a number equals the current candidate `x`, we must skip it – increase `x` by 1.  
   Because `nums[i]` is at most 50 and the array length is ≤ 50, we can simply store the numbers in a `HashSet` (or `unordered_set`) and iterate upward from `S`.

This gives an O(N) algorithm after we build the set.  
The sorting in the original LeetCode solution is unnecessary but harmless; the set approach is cleaner.

---

### 3. Correctness Proof

We prove that the algorithm returns the required smallest missing integer.

#### Lemma 1  
After step 1 the variable `S` equals the sum of the longest sequential prefix.

*Proof.*  
We start with `S = nums[0]`.  
For every `i ≥ 1` we test if `nums[i] == nums[i‑1] + 1`.  
If true, `nums[0..i]` is sequential, so we add `nums[i]` to `S`.  
If false, the longest sequential prefix ends at `i‑1`, so we stop.  
Thus the loop stops exactly at the last element of the longest sequential prefix, and `S` contains its sum. ∎

#### Lemma 2  
When the algorithm scans candidate integers `x = S, S+1, S+2, …` and stops at the first `x` not in the set of array values, that `x` is missing from `nums`.

*Proof.*  
The set contains exactly the integers that appear in `nums`.  
If the algorithm reaches a value `x` that is *not* in the set, then no element of `nums` equals `x`. ∎

#### Lemma 3  
The returned `x` is the smallest integer `≥ S` that is missing from `nums`.

*Proof.*  
The algorithm checks consecutive integers starting at `S`.  
By Lemma 2, it stops at the first missing integer.  
Therefore no integer in `[S, x‑1]` is missing, and `x` is the smallest missing integer ≥ S. ∎

#### Theorem  
The algorithm returns the required answer.

*Proof.*  
By Lemma 1, `S` is the sum of the longest sequential prefix.  
By Lemma 3, the returned `x` is the smallest integer ≥ S not present in `nums`.  
Thus the algorithm satisfies the problem’s definition. ∎

### 4. Complexity Analysis

| Step | Operation | Time | Extra Space |
|------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Scan for longest sequential prefix | **O(N)** | O(1) |
| 2 | Build set of values | **O(N)** | **O(N)** |
| 3 | Scan upward from `S` (worst‑case O(51‑S) ≤ O(50)) | **O(N)** | O(1) |

Total: **O(N)** time, **O(N)** space.  
With `N ≤ 50` this is trivial.

---

### 5. Edge Cases

| Case | Reasoning |
|------|-----------|
| All numbers are the same (`[5,5,5]`) | Longest prefix length = 1 → `S = 5`. Missing integer ≥ 5 is `6`. |
| The array is already a perfect sequential prefix (`[1,2,3,4]`) | `S = 10`; missing integer is `11`. |
| Array contains all numbers from 1 to 50 | `S` ≤ 1275, but `S` is already present. The algorithm will skip `S` and return `S+1`. |
| Array contains duplicates, e.g. `[1,2,2,3]` | Duplicates do not affect the prefix sum; set handles duplicates automatically. |

---

### 6. Code Implementations

Below are clean, language‑specific solutions that follow the set‑based algorithm described above.

---

#### 6.1 Java

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int missingInteger(int[] nums) {
        // 1. Find longest sequential prefix and its sum S
        int sum = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i - 1] + 1) {
                sum += nums[i];
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }

        // 2. Build set of all numbers in the array
        Set<Integer> present = new HashSet<>();
        for (int v : nums) {
            present.add(v);
        }

        // 3. Find smallest missing integer >= sum
        int candidate = sum;
        while (present.contains(candidate)) {
            candidate++;
        }
        return candidate;
    }
}
```

**Why this is good**  
* Uses `HashSet` for O(1) look‑ups.  
* No unnecessary sorting.  
* Easy to read and maintain.

---

#### 6.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def missingInteger(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        # Longest sequential prefix sum
        total = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == nums[i - 1] + 1:
                total += nums[i]
            else:
                break

        # Set for O(1) membership tests
        present = set(nums)

        # Smallest missing integer >= total
        candidate = total
        while candidate in present:
            candidate += 1
        return candidate
```

Python’s built‑in `set` gives the same performance as Java’s `HashSet`.

---

#### 6.3 C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    int missingInteger(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // Longest sequential prefix sum
        int sum = nums[0];
        for (size_t i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i - 1] + 1) {
                sum += nums[i];
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }

        // Build unordered_set for O(1) lookup
        std::unordered_set<int> present(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        // Smallest missing integer >= sum
        int candidate = sum;
        while (present.count(candidate)) {
            ++candidate;
        }
        return candidate;
    }
};
```

The C++ solution mirrors the Java one but uses `unordered_set`.

### 7. The Good, The Bad, The Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Concept** | Straightforward – sum + set lookup | None | – |
| **Code** | Clean, no sorting, O(N) time | None | – |
| **Readability** | High (one‑liner loops) | None | – |
| **Performance** | Tiny N → negligible | – | – |
| **Corner Cases** | Handled naturally (duplicates, small arrays) | None | – |
| **Potential Pitfall** | Forgetting to add `nums[0]` to `sum` | – | – |

> **Bottom line:** The solution is elegant and efficient; there are no hidden “ugly” parts.

---

### 8. Testing Strategy

1. **Basic tests**  
   * Example cases from the statement.  
   * Single element array (`[1]` → answer `2`).

2. **Sequential prefixes**  
   * `[4,5,6,10]` → longest prefix sum `15`, answer `15` (since 15 not present).  
   * `[10,11,12,13]` → sum `46`, answer `46`.

3. **Duplicates**  
   * `[1,2,2,3,4]` → sum `10`, answer `11`.  

4. **Full range**  
   * `[1,2,3,...,50]` → sum `1275`, answer `1276`.  

5. **Non‑sequential start**  
   * `[5,6,7]` → sum `18`, answer `18`.  

Run each language’s implementation on the same test set to ensure consistency.

#### Introduction  

If you’re hunting for a “nice” LeetCode problem that’s still fresh on the interview radar, look no further than **LeetCode 2996**. The task blends a classic prefix‑sum trick with a simple set lookup – a perfect training ground for your next data‑structure interview.

---

#### Problem Overview  

We’re given an array `nums` (size ≤ 50).  
* Find the longest prefix that is *sequential* – each number is one larger than the previous.  
* Compute the sum `S` of that prefix.  
* Return the smallest integer `x ≥ S` that does **not** appear in `nums`.

---

#### Why This Problem Is Interview‑Gold  

1. **Clarity of specification** – no hidden tricks.  
2. **Multiple valid approaches** – sorting, two‑pass, set‑lookup.  
3. **Direct application of core concepts** – loops, conditionals, hash sets.  
4. **Edge‑case richness** – duplicates, full ranges, non‑sequential starts.

---

#### The Set‑Based Algorithm  

We walk through `nums` once to find the prefix.  
Then we *build a hash set* containing all unique values.  
Finally, we iterate from `S` upward, stopping at the first missing value.

```text
O(N) time | O(N) space
```

No sorting required – this is the cleanest, fastest solution for tiny inputs.

#### Full Code Samples  

(See section 6.6 above for Java, Python, and C++ code.)

---

#### Complexity & Edge‑Case Analysis  

* **Time**: `O(N)` – a single scan + a constant‑size loop.  
* **Space**: `O(N)` – the set holds at most 50 integers.  
* **Worst‑case scan length**: 50 – so the algorithm is practically instantaneous.

#### Testing Your Solution  

1. Write a small test harness in each language.  
2. Include all provided examples and edge cases.  
3. Verify that every implementation yields the same output.
