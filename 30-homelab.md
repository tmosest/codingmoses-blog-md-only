# Lurtz and Vertical Farming...

This crane is taking forever... especially since I have fallen from having 4 working printers 3 years ago to 1 now...
My production is really down now...

Therefore we have got Lurtz working! He can look around and take photos of the plants instead.

# Warp Tour Terminal!

Got my AI terminal one step further along... now it:

1. Looks up incorrect commands or errors.
2. Knows the OS.
3. Knows the directories for determing project.
4. Returns commmands to fix it.
