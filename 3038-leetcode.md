        ## 🎯 Problem Summary – Maximum Number of Operations With the Same Score I (LeetCode 3038)

**Goal**  
Given an array `nums`, repeatedly remove the first two elements.  
The “score” of each removal is the sum of those two elements.  
All removals must produce the *same* score.  
Return the **maximum** number of such removals that can be performed.

```
Input   : nums = [3,2,1,4,5]
Output  : 2
Explanation:
  1st removal : 3 + 2 = 5  → nums = [1,4,5]
  2nd removal : 4 + 1 = 5  → nums = [5]
  No more removals possible
```

**Constraints**

| | |
|---|---|
| 2 ≤ `nums.length` ≤ 100 | 1 ≤ `nums[i]` ≤ 1000 |

## 🔍 High‑Level Insight

When we start removing elements from the *front*, the only “decision” we have to make is the **score** of the first removal.  
All later removals are forced: every subsequent pair must sum to that same score, otherwise the process stops.

Therefore:

1. Pick the sum of the first two elements as the target score (`target = nums[0] + nums[1]`).
2. Scan the array in steps of two: if `nums[i] + nums[i+1] == target`, increment the counter; otherwise stop.

That gives an optimal solution in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space.

## 📚 Solution Code (Java, Python, C++)

### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxOperations(int[] nums) {
        int target = nums[0] + nums[1];   // score of first operation
        int count = 1;                    // we can always perform the first op

        for (int i = 2; i < nums.length - 1; i += 2) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[i + 1] == target) {
                count++;
            } else {
                break;                    // score mismatch → stop
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        target = nums[0] + nums[1]   # first operation's score
        count = 1                    # the first op is always valid

        for i in range(2, len(nums) - 1, 2):
            if nums[i] + nums[i + 1] == target:
                count += 1
            else:
                break
        return count
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int target = nums[0] + nums[1];   // score of the first operation
        int count = 1;                    // first operation is always possible

        for (int i = 2; i < nums.size() - 1; i += 2) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[i + 1] == target) {
                ++count;
            } else {
                break;  // score mismatch – stop early
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

## 🔧 Complexity Analysis

| | |
|---|---|
| **Time** | `O(n)` – we iterate over the array once, step‑size 2 |
| **Space** | `O(1)` – only a few integer variables are used |

## 📌 “The Good, The Bad, The Ugly” of This Problem

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Problem Statement** | Clear, concrete constraints | Only 100 elements – trivial for most coding interviews | Very small input size → trivial solution, but still tests mindset |
| **Algorithmic Insight** | One pass after computing target sum | No need for sorting, DP, or complex data structures | Must remember that *first* pair dictates everything |
| **Edge Cases** | Even/odd length arrays handled naturally | Must handle the case where only the first two elements exist | No special case for `nums.length == 2` – but the algorithm still works |
| **Coding Practice** | Good for practicing pointer/indices and early exit | Minimal variable overhead | Over‑engineering (hash maps, greedy sub‑algorithms) is unnecessary |

### 1. Introduction

When recruiters ask you to solve **LeetCode 3038 – Maximum Number of Operations With the Same Score I**, they’re really testing your ability to:

- Understand a problem in one line
- Spot a linear‑time greedy solution
- Write clean code in your preferred language

This article walks you through the problem, shows you the best solution in Java, Python, and C++, and explains why this approach works. By the end, you’ll feel confident enough to crack similar interview questions on the spot.

---

### 2. Problem Recap

> *“You are given an array of integers `nums`. Delete the first two elements and define the score of the operation as the sum of these two elements. You can perform this operation until the array contains fewer than two elements. All operations must have the same score. Return the maximum number of operations you can perform.”*

---

### 3. Why the Solution Is So Simple

1. **The first operation fixes the score** – `target = nums[0] + nums[1]`.  
   All subsequent operations must match this sum.
2. **Subsequent operations are forced** – you can't skip or reorder elements.  
   The only decision point is whether the next pair matches `target`.
3. **Linear Scan Suffices** – we just iterate pair by pair.

This reasoning eliminates any need for fancy data structures or backtracking. The key insight is recognizing that the **first pair’s sum** is a global constraint.

---

### 4. Code Walkthrough

#### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxOperations(int[] nums) {
        int target = nums[0] + nums[1];
        int count = 1;  // at least the first operation

        for (int i = 2; i < nums.length - 1; i += 2) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[i + 1] == target) {
                count++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

**Why this works**  
- `target` is the required sum for every operation.  
- `count` starts at 1 because the first operation always succeeds.  
- The loop checks each consecutive pair; if any pair mismatches, the process stops (`break`).  
- `i < nums.length - 1` guarantees we never read out of bounds.

#### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        target = nums[0] + nums[1]
        count = 1

        for i in range(2, len(nums) - 1, 2):
            if nums[i] + nums[i + 1] == target:
                count += 1
            else:
                break
        return count
```

Python follows the same logic; the `range` step of 2 skips over processed elements.

#### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int target = nums[0] + nums[1];
        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 2; i < nums.size() - 1; i += 2) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[i + 1] == target) {
                ++count;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

C++ code mirrors the Java logic, using 0‑based indexing and `vector`.

### 5. Complexity Analysis

| Complexity | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| **Time** `O(n)` | Single pass over the array, step size 2 |
| **Space** `O(1)` | Only a few integer variables |

Because `n ≤ 100`, this solution is instantaneous in practice, but the same logic scales to larger inputs.

---

### 6. Edge Cases Covered

| Test | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `[5, 3]` | Only one operation possible |
| `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` | Mixed sums – algorithm stops at first mismatch |
| `[10, 10, 10, 10]` | All pairs equal → returns 2 |
| `[2, 8, 4, 6, 5, 5]` | Target 10 → first two pairs match, third doesn’t |

The algorithm gracefully handles all without extra logic.

---

### 7. Why This Matters for Interviews

- **Shows algorithmic thinking**: You identify that the first operation locks the score and that a linear scan is sufficient.
- **Demonstrates clean coding**: Use of meaningful variable names, early exit, and concise loops.
- **Avoids pitfalls**: No need to over‑engineer with hash maps or dynamic programming, which can distract interviewers.

---

### 8. Final Thought

LeetCode 3038 is a textbook example of a “look‑ahead” greedy problem. The optimal solution is a single pass after determining the target sum. By mastering this pattern, you’ll be ready to tackle a whole family of problems where an initial decision determines the rest of the process.

Good luck, and happy coding! 🚀
