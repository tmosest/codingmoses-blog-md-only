**Keywords**: Guess the Number Using Bitwise Questions, LeetCode 3064, bitwise AND, commonSetBits API, Java, Python, C++ solution, coding interview, software engineer

### 📌 Problem Overview

You are given a hidden integer **`n`** (1 ≤ n ≤ 2³⁰ – 1).  
The only operation you can perform is calling the API:

```text
int commonSetBits(int num)
```

`commonSetBits(num)` returns the number of bits that are set to **1** in both `n` and `num` – i.e. `popcount(n & num)`.

Your goal: **Return the value of `n`**.

The classic interview question: “How many API calls do you need? What if you can only ask about one bit at a time?”

---

### 🤔 Intuition

`num` can be any integer in the valid range.  
If you ask for a **single‑bit** number – `1 << i` – then:

- If `n` has that bit set, `n & (1 << i)` will be `1 << i`, whose popcount is **1**.
- If `n` does **not** have that bit set, the popcount will be **0**.

So by querying every bit position (0…29) we can reconstruct `n` bit by bit.  
**Exactly 30 API calls** (constant time).

---

### 🧩 Solution Outline

1. `result = 0`
2. For every bit position `i` from **0** to **29**  
   - `candidate = 1 << i`
   - If `commonSetBits(candidate) == 1` → `result |= candidate`
3. Return `result`

The algorithm is **O(1)** in time (30 constant‑time calls) and **O(1)** in space.

---

## ✅ Code Implementations

Below are clean, ready‑to‑run implementations in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
Each follows the same logic and can be copy‑pasted into your local IDE or LeetCode sandbox.

---

### Java (extends `Problem`)

```java
public class Solution extends Problem {

    // LeetCode will call this method
    public int findNumber() {
        int answer = 0;          // final number to return
        int maxBitMask = 1 << 29; // 2^29 (since 2^30-1 is the max n)

        for (int mask = 1; mask <= maxBitMask; mask <<= 1) {
            // If n has this bit set, commonSetBits(mask) will return 1
            if (commonSetBits(mask) == 1) {
                answer |= mask; // set the bit in the answer
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```

---

### Python

```python
class Solution(Problem):
    def findNumber(self) -> int:
        answer = 0
        max_mask = 1 << 29  # 2^29

        mask = 1
        while mask <= max_mask:
            if self.commonSetBits(mask) == 1:
                answer |= mask
            mask <<= 1
        return answer
```

*Note:* If you’re using LeetCode’s “Guess the Number Using Bitwise Questions I” template, the method signature may be `def findNumber(self) -> int:`.

---

### C++ (LeetCode style)

```cpp
class Solution : public Problem {
public:
    int findNumber() {
        int answer = 0;
        for (int mask = 1; mask <= (1 << 29); mask <<= 1) {
            if (commonSetBits(mask) == 1) {
                answer |= mask;
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
};
```

## 📈 Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Time** | `O(1)` – always 30 API calls regardless of `n` |
| **Space** | `O(1)` – only a few integer variables |

---

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Pitfalls

| Potential Issue | Why it matters | How to avoid |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **`num` outside 0 … 2³⁰-1** | The API becomes unreliable | Stick to `1 << i` for `i` in [0, 29] |
| **API returns 0 for `n & 0`** | Some implementations may ignore `0` | Never query `num = 0` |
| **Large `n` (e.g., 2³⁰-1)** | Must handle 30 bits | Use `int` (32‑bit signed) – fits comfortably |

---

## 🔄 Alternative Approaches

1. **Binary Search on Bits**  
   Query for all numbers with a particular prefix and deduce bits in O(log n).  
   *Not necessary* because the 30‑bit exhaustive approach is already optimal.

2. **Gray Code Traversal**  
   Ask for all Gray‑coded numbers to recover the bits in one pass.  
   *Complex and over‑engineering* for this problem.

3. **Bit‑masking via XOR**  
   Instead of `commonSetBits`, query `n XOR num`.  
   *But the API is fixed*, so not applicable.

---

## 🎯 Why This Solution Rocks (The Good)

- **Simplicity** – one loop, no recursion, no auxiliary data structures.
- **Optimal** – 30 queries, the theoretical minimum for 30 bits.
- **Readability** – clear bit‑wise logic, comments explain intent.
- **Portability** – same idea works in any language with bit ops.

---

## ⚠️ What Could Go Wrong (The Bad)

- **Misunderstanding the API** – thinking `commonSetBits` returns the *count* of common bits in `num` alone (it doesn't).
- **Bit overflow** – using `1 << 30` would overflow a 32‑bit signed integer; always limit to 29.
- **Neglecting the 0‑bit** – if you query `num = 0`, the API might not provide useful information.

---

## 🕸️ The Ugly – Real‑World Traps

1. **API Side‑Effects** – In some interview setups, each API call might be costly (network round‑trip). Although the algorithm is optimal, the constant factor can still matter. Use caching if you need to ask the same bit multiple times (not needed here).

2. **Hidden Constraints** – Some variations of the problem might set a limit on the total number of calls (e.g., 20). In such cases, you’d need a smarter strategy (e.g., parallel bit deduction). Our current solution assumes the standard LeetCode limit (30).

3. **Non‑Integer `n`** – If `n` could be negative or larger than 2³⁰-1, the algorithm would break. Always read constraints carefully.

---

## 🎓 Takeaway for Your Interview Portfolio

- **Demonstrate** how to convert a *bitwise query* problem into a *simple loop*.
- **Show** mastery of bit‑operations (`<<`, `|=`).
- **Explain** complexity clearly – employers love concise analysis.
- **Mention** the potential pitfalls – interviewers appreciate that you think about edge cases.
