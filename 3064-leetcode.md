## 📌 Problem Overview

> **LeetCode 3064 – Guess the Number Using Bitwise Questions**  
> **Difficulty:** Medium

We’re given a hidden integer `n` (1 ≤ n < 2³⁰).  
The only tool at our disposal is an API:

```text
int commonSetBits(int num);
```

`commonSetBits(num)` returns the number of **bit positions** where both `n` and `num` have a `1`.  
In other words:

```text
commonSetBits(num) == popcount(n & num)
```

Your goal is to recover `n` by calling the API any number of times (the fewer the better) and return it.

> **Key Insight**  
> If we test a number that has exactly one bit set (e.g., `1, 2, 4, 8, …`), the API will return `1` iff that bit is also set in `n`.  
> So we can simply check each of the 30 possible bits once and assemble the answer.

---

## 🧩 Intuitive Brute‑Force

A naïve approach is to query every possible integer in the allowed range (`1 … 2³⁰‑1`).  
For each candidate `x` we check if `commonSetBits(x) == 1`.  
This is **O(2³⁰)** calls – completely impractical and against the spirit of the problem.

*Why this is bad?*  
- 1,073,741,823 API calls → impossible within time limits.  
- Excessive network/IO overhead.  
- Gives little insight into the bit‑wise nature of the problem.

---

## ⚡️ Fastest O(1) Approach – Bit by Bit

### Idea

1. **Iterate over each bit position** `i` (0 … 29).  
2. Construct `mask = 1 << i`.  
3. Call `commonSetBits(mask)`.  
   * If the answer is `1`, set that bit in `n`.  
   * If the answer is `0`, leave the bit cleared.  

Since we perform **exactly 30 API calls**, the algorithm runs in constant time relative to input size.

### Why 30 Calls?  
- The maximum allowed number (`2³⁰‑1`) has 30 bits.  
- Each call tells us the state of one bit, so 30 calls suffice.

### Pseudocode

```text
result = 0
for i from 0 to 29:
    mask = 1 << i
    if commonSetBits(mask) == 1:
        result |= mask
return result
```

## 📚 Java Implementation

```java
/**
 * LeetCode 3064 – Guess the Number Using Bitwise Questions
 * Author: Your Name
 * Tags: Bit Manipulation, Brute Force, Interview
 */
public class Solution extends Problem {
    public int findNumber() {
        int n = 0;
        // 30 bits (0‑based index)
        for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
            int mask = 1 << i;
            if (commonSetBits(mask) == 1) {
                n |= mask;
            }
        }
        return n;
    }
}
```

**Why this is the “good” Java solution**

- Uses *bit shifting* instead of `Math.pow` for speed.  
- Runs in constant time: **O(1)**.  
- Uses only O(1) extra space.

## 📚 Python Implementation

```python
"""
LeetCode 3064 – Guess the Number Using Bitwise Questions
"""

class Solution(Problem):
    def findNumber(self) -> int:
        n = 0
        for i in range(30):          # bits 0..29
            mask = 1 << i
            if self.commonSetBits(mask) == 1:
                n |= mask
        return n
```

**Python notes**

- `Problem` is the base class that provides `commonSetBits`.  
- `self.commonSetBits` is used inside the method.  
- Still **O(1)** time and space.

---

## 📚 C++ Implementation

```cpp
/**
 * LeetCode 3064 – Guess the Number Using Bitwise Questions
 * Author: Your Name
 * Complexity: O(1) time, O(1) space
 */
class Solution : public Problem {
public:
    int findNumber() override {
        int n = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 30; ++i) {
            int mask = 1 << i;
            if (commonSetBits(mask) == 1)
                n |= mask;
        }
        return n;
    }
};
```

*Why C++ works the same*

- Uses bit shift (`1 << i`) just like Java/Python.  
- `commonSetBits` is a virtual method defined in the base class.

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Loop over 30 bits | **O(1)** (constant 30 iterations) | **O(1)** |
| Each API call | negligible (provided by LeetCode) | — |

**Total:**  
- **Time:** O(1) – 30 API calls regardless of the hidden number.  
- **Space:** O(1) – only a few integer variables.

## 🚧 Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases

| Pitfall | Why it Happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Using `1 << 30`** | Overflows a signed 32‑bit integer. | Stick to `1 << 29` for the highest bit in a 30‑bit number, or use `1L << i` if 64‑bit. |
| **Incorrect API usage** | Some solutions mistakenly call `commonSetBits(1 << i)` multiple times or mix up bit indices. | Keep the call inside the loop; ensure each mask has exactly one bit set. |
| **Zero‑based vs One‑based indices** | Off‑by‑one errors can skip a bit or read past the limit. | Loop from `i = 0` to `i < 30`. |
| **Assuming 32‑bit integer limit** | The hidden number can be up to `2³⁰‑1`, so only 30 bits are relevant. | Don’t test bits beyond 29. |

---

## 🔧 Alternative Strategies

| Strategy | When to Use | Complexity |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Binary Search on Bits** | If you can query numbers with multiple bits set and want fewer than 30 calls. | Roughly `log₂(30)` ≈ 5 calls if cleverly chosen masks. |
| **Randomized Sampling** | When the API is noisy or expensive; useful for larger bit‑length problems. | Depends on sampling; not guaranteed O(1). |
| **Bit‑wise Counting** | For educational purposes; shows popcount and mask building. | O(30) calls still, but with more complex logic. |

> **Why the simple 30‑call method is usually best**  
> The problem constraints guarantee that 30 calls are both sufficient and minimal. Adding complexity only makes the code harder to read and increases the risk of bugs.
