## Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value I  
### A One‑liner LeetCode “Easy” – Java | Python | C++  

**LeetCode ID:** 3065  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Keywords:** LeetCode, Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value I, algorithm, Java, Python, C++, interview coding, time complexity, space complexity  

---

### 🚀 TL;DR  
> **Answer = number of elements strictly less than `k`.**  
> Count them once – that’s all you need.  
> **Time:** `O(n)` **Space:** `O(1)`

## 1. Problem Recap

You’re given a 0‑indexed array `nums` and an integer `k`.  
In one operation you may **remove one occurrence of the smallest element** of `nums`.  
Return the minimum number of operations required so that **every remaining element is ≥ k**.  
You’re guaranteed that at least one element in the original array is already ≥ k.

---

## 2. Intuition – “Just Count”

The operation always removes the current smallest element.  
If an element is already ≥ k it will never be removed – it is never the smallest among the *bad* elements.  
Therefore, to finish the job you simply need to eliminate **all elements that are < k**.  

The order in which you delete them does not matter:  
*Deleting the smallest bad element each time is equivalent to deleting any bad element.*  
Hence the minimum number of operations is exactly the number of “bad” elements.

## 3. Common Pitfalls (The Bad & the Ugly)

| What people often do | Why it’s a problem |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| **Sort the array first** and then pop until all remaining ≥ k | `O(n log n)` time and `O(n)` extra space – overkill for an `O(n)` solution. |
| **Simulate the deletions** by repeatedly scanning for the minimum | `O(n²)` worst‑case – unnecessary because the answer is just a count. |
| **Misread the problem** and think you must delete *only* the absolute smallest element of the *entire* array | You only delete bad elements; good elements never get removed. |

---

## 4. Algorithm (One‑Liner)

```
count = 0
for each x in nums:
    if x < k:
        count += 1
return count
```

That’s it! No sorting, no heaps, no simulation.

## 5. Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Java | Python | C++ |
|--------|------|--------|-----|
| Time   | `O(n)` | `O(n)` | `O(n)` |
| Space  | `O(1)` | `O(1)` | `O(1)` |

The loop visits each element once and uses only a single integer counter.

## 6. Code Implementations

### 6.1 Java

```java
/**
 * LeetCode 3065 – Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value I
 */
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int val : nums) {
            if (val < k) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

---

### 6.2 Python

```python
# LeetCode 3065 – Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value I
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        return sum(1 for x in nums if x < k)
```

---

### 6.3 C++

```cpp
// LeetCode 3065 – Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value I
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int x : nums)
            if (x < k) ++cnt;
        return cnt;
    }
};
```

## 7. Edge Cases

| Test | Input | Output | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | `nums = [1, 1, 2, 4, 9]`, `k = 1` | `0` | All elements already ≥ k. |
| 2 | `nums = [1, 1, 2, 4, 9]`, `k = 9` | `4` | Four elements < 9 must be removed. |
| 3 | `nums = [2, 11, 10, 1, 3]`, `k = 10` | `3` | Elements 2, 1, 3 are removed. |

---

## 8. FAQ

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **What if the array is already all ≥ k?** | Return 0 – no operation needed. |
| **Do we need to actually delete elements?** | No, only the count matters. |
| **Can we delete elements > k?** | We’re never forced to; doing so would increase the operation count. |
| **Why does the constraint “at least one element ≥ k” matter?** | It guarantees that the final array will be non‑empty and the problem is solvable. |

## 9. Take‑away for Interviews

* **Spot the “count” pattern** – many easy LeetCode problems reduce to a single aggregate (sum, count, max, min).  
* **Avoid unnecessary sorting or simulation** – they’re common traps.  
* **Explain your reasoning** – interviewers love concise, mathematically‑grounded answers.
