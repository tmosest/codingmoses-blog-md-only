        # 1Ô∏è‚É£ Solution ‚Äì Count Pairs of Connectable Servers (LeetCode¬†3067)

**Problem Recap**

You are given an *unrooted weighted tree* with `n` servers (vertices) numbered `0 ‚Ä¶ n‚Äë1`.  
For every edge `edges[i] = [u, v, w]` the distance between `u` and `v` is `w`.  
A pair of servers `(a, b)` is **connectable through a server `c`** if

1. `a < b` and `a != c`, `b != c`,
2. `dist(c, a)` is divisible by `signalSpeed`,
3. `dist(c, b)` is divisible by `signalSpeed`,
4. The two simple paths `c ‚Üí a` and `c ‚Üí b` share no edge.

Return an array `cnt[0 ‚Ä¶ n‚Äë1]` where `cnt[c]` is the number of such pairs for each server `c`.

The constraints are small (`n ‚â§ 1000`) so an `O(n¬≤)` solution is fine.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄØWhy an `O(n¬≤)` DFS‚Äëfrom‚Äëeach‚Äënode works

* For a fixed centre `c` every neighbour subtree of `c` is independent ‚Äì any pair of connectable servers must lie in two *different* subtrees of `c`.  
* In a subtree we only need to know **how many** nodes have a distance from `c` that is a multiple of `signalSpeed`.  
* While exploring a subtree we can keep the current distance from `c`; if it‚Äôs a multiple we increment a counter.  
* After exploring one subtree we combine its counter with the counters of the subtrees already processed ‚Äì that gives all pairs that use this new subtree.

The algorithm is exactly the same as in the accepted LeetCode solutions that appear in the problem‚Äôs editorial.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄØImplementation in 3 Languages

Below you‚Äôll find clean, commented implementations in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
All three share the same logic and run in `O(n¬≤)` time, `O(n)` memory.

### 3.1 Java 17

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    // adjacency list: each element is {neighbour, weight}
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    private List<int[]>[] buildAdj(int[][] edges, int n) {
        List<int[]>[] g = new ArrayList[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) g[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] e : edges) {
            int u = e[0], v = e[1], w = e[2];
            g[u].add(new int[]{v, w});
            g[v].add(new int[]{u, w});
        }
        return g;
    }

    // DFS that returns the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at node
    // whose distance from the centre `c` is divisible by mod.
    private int dfs(int node, int parent, long dist, int mod, List<int[]>[] g) {
        int cnt = (dist % mod == 0) ? 1 : 0;          // current node
        for (int[] nb : g[node]) {
            int nxt = nb[0], w = nb[1];
            if (nxt == parent) continue;
            cnt += dfs(nxt, node, dist + w, mod, g);
        }
        return cnt;
    }

    public int[] countPairsOfConnectableServers(int[][] edges, int signalSpeed) {
        int n = edges.length + 1;
        List<int[]>[] g = buildAdj(edges, n);
        int[] ans = new int[n];

        for (int c = 0; c < n; c++) {
            long pairs = 0;
            int prefix = 0;           // number of divisible nodes in processed subtrees
            for (int[] nb : g[c]) {
                int child = nb[0], w = nb[1];
                int subCnt = dfs(child, c, w, signalSpeed, g);
                pairs += 1L * subCnt * prefix;   // pairs formed with previous subtrees
                prefix += subCnt;
            }
            ans[c] = (int) pairs;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

> **Why `long`?**  
> Distances can be up to `n * 10‚Å∂` (‚âà10‚Åπ), so we use `long` to avoid overflow.

### 3.2 Python¬†3.9

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)   # safe for n ‚â§ 1000

class Solution:
    def build_adj(self, edges, n):
        g = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in edges:
            g[u].append((v, w))
            g[v].append((u, w))
        return g

    def dfs(self, node, parent, dist, mod, g):
        """Return how many nodes in the subtree rooted at node
        have distance from the centre a multiple of mod."""
        cnt = 1 if dist % mod == 0 else 0
        for nxt, w in g[node]:
            if nxt == parent:
                continue
            cnt += self.dfs(nxt, node, dist + w, mod, g)
        return cnt

    def countPairsOfConnectableServers(self, edges, signalSpeed):
        n = len(edges) + 1
        g = self.build_adj(edges, n)
        res = [0] * n

        for c in range(n):
            pairs = 0
            pref = 0
            for nxt, w in g[c]:
                sub = self.dfs(nxt, c, w, signalSpeed, g)
                pairs += sub * pref
                pref += sub
            res[c] = pairs
        return res
```

> **Tip for interviewers** ‚Äì keep the recursion depth low by raising `sys.setrecursionlimit` if you‚Äôre not sure about the stack.

### 3.3 C++17

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
    vector<vector<pair<int,int>>> g;   // {neighbour, weight}

    // DFS that counts nodes whose distance from the centre is multiple of mod
    int dfs(int node, int parent, long long dist, int mod) {
        int cnt = (dist % mod == 0) ? 1 : 0;
        for (auto [nxt, w] : g[node]) {
            if (nxt == parent) continue;
            cnt += dfs(nxt, node, dist + w, mod);
        }
        return cnt;
    }

public:
    vector<int> countPairsOfConnectableServers(vector<vector<int>>& edges, int signalSpeed) {
        int n = edges.size() + 1;
        g.assign(n, {});
        for (auto &e : edges) {
            int u = e[0], v = e[1], w = e[2];
            g[u].push_back({v, w});
            g[v].push_back({u, w});
        }

        vector<int> ans(n);
        for (int c = 0; c < n; ++c) {
            long long pairs = 0;
            int pref = 0;
            for (auto [child, w] : g[c]) {
                int subCnt = dfs(child, c, w, signalSpeed);
                pairs += 1LL * subCnt * pref;
                pref += subCnt;
            }
            ans[c] = static_cast<int>(pairs);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

> **Why `long long`?**  
> The same overflow protection that applies to Java.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄØTesting the Code

```python
# Quick test harness (Python)
edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,2],[2,3,3]]
signal = 2
print(Solution().countPairsOfConnectableServers(edges, signal))
# Expected output: [1, 1, 0, 0]
```

You can run analogous tests in Java or C++ by copying the code into an online compiler or a local IDE.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄØGood, Bad & Ugly ‚Äì What You Should Discuss in an Interview

| ‚úÖ Good | ‚ö†Ô∏è Bad | üëø Ugly |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Intuitive logic** ‚Äì The algorithm mirrors the problem statement exactly. | **Quadratic time** ‚Äì For `n = 1000` it‚Äôs still fine, but on larger trees it would explode. | **Duplicate code** ‚Äì Every language needs its own DFS helper; the core idea is the same but the syntax repeats. |
| **Linear memory** ‚Äì `O(n)` adjacency list + recursion stack. | **Recursion depth** ‚Äì Python/C++ recursion can hit a limit for very deep trees (though 1000 is safe). | **Overflow risk** ‚Äì Using `int` for distances may break on heavy weights; use `long` / `long long`. |
| **Clear modularity** ‚Äì Separate `build_adj`, `dfs`, and main loop. | **No pruning** ‚Äì Every DFS visits the entire tree again. | **Hard to extend** ‚Äì If you need to support many queries (different `signalSpeed`), you‚Äôll redo all work. |

> **How to talk about this in an interview**  
> *‚ÄúI used an `O(n¬≤)` approach that does a DFS from each centre to count how many nodes in each child subtree have a distance that is a multiple of the given speed. Because each pair of connectable servers must come from two different subtrees of the centre, I combine the counts using a prefix sum.‚Äù*  
> This demonstrates your understanding of tree decomposition and modular arithmetic.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄØPotential Improvements (The ‚ÄúWhy I‚Äôm Still Interview‚ÄëReady‚Äù Section)

If a hiring manager asks ‚Äúcan you do better?‚Äù you can mention:

1. **Centroid Decomposition** ‚Äì Reduces the total number of DFS runs from `O(n¬≤)` to `O(n log n)` by recursively splitting the tree around its centroid.  
2. **Dynamic Programming on the Tree** ‚Äì If `signalSpeed` is fixed for the whole test case, you can propagate modulo counters bottom‚Äëup in a single DFS.  
3. **Bitset / BFS** ‚Äì When weights are small you can pre‚Äëcompute remainders in O(n) per centre.

These optimisations aren‚Äôt strictly necessary for the given constraints, but knowing them shows you‚Äôre *aware* of performance trade‚Äëoffs ‚Äì exactly what interviewers love.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄØTake‚Äëaway: How to Nail the LeetCode¬†3067 Interview Question

| What you‚Äôll demonstrate | Why it matters |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| **Tree traversal** ‚Äì DFS/BFS, recursion, stack, adjacency lists | Trees are a staple in interview questions (binary, n‚Äëary, weighted). |
| **Modular arithmetic** ‚Äì Counting nodes whose distance is a multiple of a value | Shows you can apply mathematical reasoning to a data structure. |
| **Combining sub‚Äësolutions** ‚Äì prefix sum trick | Displays you can think in *parts* and *whole* simultaneously. |
| **Complexity analysis** | Interviewers expect you to discuss `O(n¬≤)` vs. `O(n log n)`. |
| **Language versatility** | Coding in Java, Python, C++ shows you can translate concepts across stacks. |

> If you‚Äôre preparing for a coding interview, practice writing the `dfs` helper once, then reuse it for the ‚Äúcombine‚Äëwith‚Äëprevious‚Äësubtree‚Äù logic. Comment your code well ‚Äì that‚Äôs what recruiters look for.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄØFAQ (From the Interviewer‚Äôs POV)

**Q1. Why do we not need to care about `a < b`?**  
The algorithm counts unordered pairs once per centre, and the problem statement only requires that each pair is counted for the centre `c` that satisfies the conditions. The `a < b` condition is only there to avoid double‚Äëcounting across the whole set of servers, not for the centre‚Äëspecific counting.

**Q2. Is `int` enough for distances?**  
Edge weights are up to `10‚Å∂` and the tree depth can be `n-1`. The maximum distance is `‚âà10‚Åπ`, which *does* fit in a signed 32‚Äëbit integer, but the sum of many such distances may exceed it, so it‚Äôs safer to use `long`/`long long`.

**Q3. How would you speed this up for `n = 10‚Åµ`?**  
You‚Äôd switch to a centroid decomposition or heavy‚Äëlight decomposition approach that runs in `O(n log n)` or even `O(n)` in some cases.



---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄØConclusion

- An `O(n¬≤)` DFS‚Äëfrom‚Äëeach‚Äënode algorithm is clean, straightforward, and passes the LeetCode limits.  
- All three language snippets above use the same elegant idea: *count divisible nodes in each child subtree, then combine counts across subtrees*.  
- Discussing the algorithm in an interview shows you understand **tree independence**, **modular arithmetic**, and **pair counting** ‚Äì all classic interview concepts.

Happy coding, and good luck landing that software engineering role! üöÄ

## 11Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄØBonus ‚Äì A Quick One‚ÄëLiner for Competitive Programmers

If you‚Äôre absolutely sure that `signalSpeed` divides all edge weights, the DFS counter simplifies to *count all nodes* in the subtree, which turns the whole solution into a single `O(n)` pass. That‚Äôs a neat trick you can mention during an interview to showcase deeper insights.
