        ## 3095 – Shortest Subarray With OR at Least K I  

**Problem Recap**  
Given an array of non‑negative integers `nums` (length ≤ 50, each `nums[i]` ≤ 50) and an integer `k` (0 ≤ k < 64), find the length of the shortest contiguous sub‑array whose bitwise OR is **≥ k**.  
Return `-1` if no such sub‑array exists.  

Because the constraints are tiny, a **brute‑force** `O(n²)` solution works, but interviewers love to see a *sliding window* + *bit‑frequency table* approach that scales to `n = 10⁵`.  Below you’ll find production‑ready, language‑agnostic code (Java, Python, C++) followed by a SEO‑friendly blog post that covers the *good, the bad, and the ugly* of the solution.

---

## 1. Production‑Ready Code

> *All three implementations share the same algorithmic core:*
> * a sliding window `[left, right]` that grows to the right,
> * a bit‑frequency table `cnt[0…31]` that keeps track of how many numbers in the current window set each bit,
> * a dynamic `orValue` that is recomputed from the table whenever the window is shrunk.

### 1.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {

    // Adds x to the current window
    private void add(int x, int[] cnt, int[] orVal) {
        for (int b = 0; b < 32; b++) {
            if ((x & (1 << b)) != 0) {
                if (++cnt[b] == 1)          // first number with this bit set
                    orVal[0] |= 1 << b;     // set the bit in the OR value
            }
        }
    }

    // Removes x from the current window
    private void remove(int x, int[] cnt, int[] orVal) {
        for (int b = 0; b < 32; b++) {
            if ((x & (1 << b)) != 0) {
                if (--cnt[b] == 0)          // no more numbers with this bit
                    orVal[0] &= ~(1 << b); // clear the bit
            }
        }
    }

    public int minimumSubarrayLength(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int minLen = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int[] cnt = new int[32];      // frequency of every bit in the window
        int[] orVal = {0};            // wrapped int so we can mutate it

        for (int left = 0, right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            add(nums[right], cnt, orVal);

            while (orVal[0] >= k) {                 // window is already large enough
                minLen = Math.min(minLen, right - left + 1);
                remove(nums[left], cnt, orVal);
                left++;                              // shrink from the left
            }
        }

        return minLen == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : minLen;
    }
}
```

**Complexities**

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Sliding window + bit counts | `O(n)` | `O(1)` (32‑int table) |

---

### 1.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumSubarrayLength(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        min_len = float('inf')
        cnt = [0] * 32          # frequency table
        or_val = 0

        left = 0
        for right, val in enumerate(nums):
            # expand window to the right
            for b in range(32):
                if val >> b & 1:
                    cnt[b] += 1
                    if cnt[b] == 1:
                        or_val |= 1 << b

            # contract while the OR satisfies the condition
            while or_val >= k and left <= right:
                min_len = min(min_len, right - left + 1)

                # remove nums[left] from window
                for b in range(32):
                    if nums[left] >> b & 1:
                        cnt[b] -= 1
                        if cnt[b] == 0:
                            or_val &= ~(1 << b)
                left += 1

        return -1 if min_len == float('inf') else min_len
```

### 1.3 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSubarrayLength(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        const int BITS = 32;
        vector<int> cnt(BITS, 0);
        int orVal = 0;
        int minLen = INT_MAX;
        int left = 0;

        auto add = [&](int x) {
            for (int b = 0; b < BITS; ++b) {
                if (x & (1 << b)) {
                    if (++cnt[b] == 1)
                        orVal |= 1 << b;
                }
            }
        };

        auto remove = [&](int x) {
            for (int b = 0; b < BITS; ++b) {
                if (x & (1 << b)) {
                    if (--cnt[b] == 0)
                        orVal &= ~(1 << b);
                }
            }
        };

        for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); ++right) {
            add(nums[right]);

            while (orVal >= k) {
                minLen = min(minLen, right - left + 1);
                remove(nums[left++]);
            }
        }

        return minLen == INT_MAX ? -1 : minLen;
    }
};
```

### 1️⃣ Why Interviewers Love This Problem

* **Bit‑wise reasoning** – Show you understand bit manipulation, a core CS topic.
* **Sliding window** – Proves you can convert “brute force” into an *O(n)* solution.
* **Space optimisation** – 32‑int counter is a classic *O(1)* extra space trick.
* **Scalability** – The same code works for `n = 10⁵` and `k = 2³⁶`.

If you can deliver the above in three languages with clean, commented code, you’ll stand out to recruiters and hiring managers.

---

### 2️⃣ The Good – Why This Approach Rocks

| ✅ Feature | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Linear Time** | `O(n)` even for huge arrays – interviewers love algorithms that scale. |
| **O(1) Extra Space** | 32‑int table – no dynamic memory overhead. |
| **Deterministic Sliding Window** | Guarantees the *shortest* sub‑array is found as soon as the condition is met. |
| **Idiomatic Code** | Clear `add`/`remove` helpers, making the logic transparent in any language. |
| **Test‑Driven** | Easy to unit‑test each helper (`add`, `remove`, `orVal` update). |

> *Tip:* In Java, wrap the OR value in a single‑element array (`int[] orVal = {0}`) so that helper methods can mutate it – a subtle but crucial trick that keeps the code tidy.

---

### 3️⃣ The Bad – Common Pitfalls

| ⚠️ Issue | How to Avoid It |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Bit‑count overflow** | All numbers are ≤ 50 → only lower 6 bits used, but we keep 32 bits to stay generic. |
| **Forgetting to clear bits** | After removing a number, check if the bit count reaches 0 **before** clearing the OR bit. |
| **Index mis‑management** | Sliding window boundaries must be inclusive on the left, exclusive on the right in some languages; keep an eye on `right - left + 1`. |
| **Off‑by‑one in the while loop** | The `while (orVal >= k)` loop *must* shrink before updating `minLen` to capture the *shortest* window. |

---

### 4️⃣ The Ugly – When Things Go Wrong

1. **Recomputing OR from scratch**  
   *The naive way is to recompute the OR value by iterating over the window again.*  
   This gives `O(n²)` time – acceptable for `n = 50` but disastrous for large inputs.  

2. **Using a HashMap of Integers**  
   *Some candidates create a `Map<Integer, Integer>` of bit → count.*  
   While correct, the overhead of map lookups and boxing/unboxing can be orders of magnitude slower than an array of primitives.

3. **Over‑Optimisation for a Small Input**  
   *Writing a complex sliding‑window for `n ≤ 50` is overkill.*  
   Interviewers appreciate the *right* level of complexity – not “too simple” nor “too crazy”.

---

### 5️⃣ Interview‑Ready Talking Points

| Question | Suggested Answer |
|----------|------------------|
| *Why bit‑frequency table instead of recomputing OR on every removal?* | Because recomputing OR from scratch would be `O(bits)` for each shrink. The table lets us clear bits in constant time. |
| *Can we do better than `O(n)`?* | With these constraints, `O(n)` is optimal. For the “II” version, you still need a sliding window; `O(n)` stays optimal. |
| *What about negative numbers?* | The problem guarantees non‑negative numbers. If negatives were allowed, you'd need to treat sign bit separately. |
| *How does the algorithm behave when k is 0?* | The OR of any non‑empty sub‑array is ≥ 0, so the answer is always 1 (the smallest sub‑array). The algorithm will handle this naturally. |

### 3.1 Introduction (≈ 150 words)

```
If you’re preparing for a software‑engineering interview, LeetCode 3095 is a classic “bit‑wise OR” problem that tests both your low‑level thinking and your ability to write clean, scalable code. In this post, I’ll walk you through three production‑ready solutions – a brute‑force O(n²) baseline, the scalable sliding‑window + bit‑frequency approach, and how the same logic translates across Java, Python, and C++. By the end, you’ll know:
- What makes the sliding‑window trick powerful,
- When you can safely use the simpler O(n²) solution,
- How to avoid subtle bugs that trip up many candidates.
```

### 3.2 Problem Recap (≈ 100 words)

```
Given an array `arr` and an integer `k`, find the smallest contiguous sub‑array whose bitwise OR is at least `k`. All numbers are non‑negative, so the sign bit is irrelevant. The naive solution checks every possible sub‑array, leading to O(n²). We’ll show why that’s insufficient for large datasets and present a linear‑time algorithm that keeps memory usage constant.
```

### 3.3 Brute‑Force O(n²) (≈ 150 words)

```
While this algorithm is acceptable for the problem’s 50‑element constraint, it gives a good “sanity check” baseline and helps you verify your more advanced solutions. Here’s a short snippet in Python:

```

*(Insert Python brute‑force snippet)*

```
The key is to compute OR on the fly as you extend the window, but when you contract it, you have to recompute the OR again – that’s what kills performance in larger inputs.
```

### 3.4 The Sliding‑Window + Bit‑Frequency Table (≈ 400 words)

> *Explain the concept: sliding window keeps a running OR; bit‑count array keeps frequency; removal is constant time.*

```
We begin by walking through the algorithm in plain English:
1. Initialize left and right pointers at the start of the array.
2. Expand the right pointer, adding bits to the frequency table and updating the running OR.
3. While the running OR satisfies `or_val >= k`, update the best answer and shrink from the left.
4. Continue until the right pointer reaches the end.

The critical insight is that we never recompute the OR value from scratch when removing an element. Instead, we decrement the frequency of each bit that appears in the removed number and only clear the OR bit if its count hits zero. This keeps each operation O(1), giving an overall O(n) runtime.

Below is the exact code for each language. Notice how the helpers (`add`/`remove`) keep the main loop short and readable. For Java, the OR value is wrapped in a one‑element array so that the helper methods can mutate it. In Python, we use a list comprehension to keep the logic concise. In C++, we employ a lambda to keep the helper code inline.
```

*Insert code snippets side‑by‑side or use a code‑block per language.*

### 3.5 Edge Cases & Tips (≈ 150 words)

```
- k == 0: Any sub‑array is valid – the answer is always 1. Your algorithm will return 1 naturally.
- k > max_possible_OR: If k is larger than the OR of the entire array, the answer is -1. The algorithm gracefully exits with INT_MAX / inf.
- Small arrays: While a sliding window is over‑engineered for n <= 50, recruiters appreciate seeing you write an optimal solution anyway.
```

### 3.6 Common Interview Questions (≈ 150 words)

```
Q: Why do we keep 32 bits even though the input values use only 6 bits?
A: Storing 32 bits keeps the solution generic and protects against future changes. It also aligns with most languages’ integer size.

Q: What if the array contained negative numbers?
A: Negative numbers introduce the sign bit. The algorithm would still work if we treat sign separately or convert numbers to unsigned representations.

Q: Is it safe to use a dictionary for the frequency table in Python?
A: It works but introduces overhead. An array of 32 integers is faster and more memory‑efficient.
