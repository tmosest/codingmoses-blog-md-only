        ## 1.  Problem Overview – 3096. Minimum Levels to Gain More Points  

| LeetCode | Difficulty | Tags | Link |
|----------|------------|------|------|
| [3096 – Minimum Levels to Gain More Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-levels-to-gain-more-points/) | Medium | Array, Prefix Sum | ✅ |

**What you need to do**

You are given an array `possible` of length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵).  
- `possible[i] == 1` → the level can be cleared (gains +1 point).  
- `possible[i] == 0` → the level cannot be cleared (loses –1 point).

Alice starts at level 0 and plays a **prefix** of the array.  
Bob plays the remaining suffix.  
Both players play optimally to maximize their own points.

Return the *smallest* number of levels Alice must play so that her score is strictly higher than Bob’s.  
If it is impossible, return **–1**.  
Both players must play at least one level.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.  Intuition

The game is a simple “+1 / –1” score per level.  
Let

```
prefix[i]  = sum of possible[0 … i]  (using +1 for 1, –1 for 0)
total      = sum of possible[0 … n‑1]
```

If Alice stops after level `i` (she plays `i+1` levels),  
- Alice’s score = `prefix[i]`
- Bob’s score   = `total – prefix[i]`

We need the earliest `i` such that

```
prefix[i]  >  total – prefix[i]     ⇔    2*prefix[i]  >  total
```

Because `n` can be up to 100 000, we need an **O(n)** single‑pass solution.  
The prefix sum idea gives exactly that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3.  Algorithm (O(n) time, O(1) space)

```
total = 0
for each v in possible:
        total += (v == 1) ? 1 : -1

prefix = 0
for i from 0 to n-2:          // Bob must get at least one level
        prefix += (possible[i] == 1) ? 1 : -1
        if prefix > total - prefix:
                return i + 1   // Alice played i+1 levels
return -1
```

*Why `n-2`?*  
If `i == n-1`, Bob would get 0 levels – invalid.  
If `i == n-2`, Bob gets exactly one level – still valid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4.  Implementation

### 4.1 Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumLevels(int[] possible) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int v : possible) {
            total += (v == 1) ? 1 : -1;          // +1 or -1
        }

        int prefix = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < possible.length - 1; i++) {
            prefix += (possible[i] == 1) ? 1 : -1;
            if (prefix > total - prefix) {
                return i + 1;                   // Alice played i+1 levels
            }
        }
        return -1;                              // impossible
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumLevels(self, possible: List[int]) -> int:
        total = sum(1 if v == 1 else -1 for v in possible)

        prefix = 0
        # Bob must play at least one level => stop before last element
        for i in range(len(possible) - 1):
            prefix += 1 if possible[i] == 1 else -1
            if prefix > total - prefix:
                return i + 1
        return -1
```

### 4.3 C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLevels(vector<int>& possible) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int v : possible)
            total += (v == 1) ? 1 : -1;          // +1 or -1

        int prefix = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)possible.size() - 1; ++i) {
            prefix += (possible[i] == 1) ? 1 : -1;
            if (prefix > total - prefix)
                return i + 1;                   // Alice plays i+1 levels
        }
        return -1;                              // impossible
    }
};
```

All three solutions run in **O(n)** time and use only a few integer variables (O(1) space).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5.  Complexity Analysis

| Implementation | Time | Extra Space |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| Java | **O(n)** | **O(1)** |
| Python | **O(n)** | **O(1)** |
| C++ | **O(n)** | **O(1)** |

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6.  Common Pitfalls (The Ugly)

| Pitfall | Why it fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Indexing off‑by‑one** – using `i <= n-1` instead of `i < n-1`. | Bob may get 0 levels → invalid. | Loop until `n-2` (or `i < n-1`). |
| **Wrong sign conversion** – treating `0` as `0` instead of `-1`. | The score for an impossible level is `-1`, not `0`. | Convert `possible[i] == 0` to `-1`. |
| **Integer overflow** – using `int` for huge arrays in languages like C++. | `total` could go beyond 2⁶³? Not for constraints, but safe to use `long long`. | Use `long long` if you want to be extra safe. |
| **Missing Bob‑level constraint** – not ensuring Bob has at least one level. | Might return `n` when it should be `-1`. | Stop the loop at `n-2`. |

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7.  The Good – Why This Solution Rocks

* **Simplicity** – A single pass, no extra data structures.  
* **Scalability** – Handles the maximum `n = 10⁵` effortlessly.  
* **Deterministic** – Guarantees the minimal prefix without backtracking.  
* **Portable** – The same O(n) logic translates to any language.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8.  The Bad – What Could Go Wrong?

* If you forget the “Bob must play at least one level” rule, you might return `n`.  
* Mixing up the sign for a `0` level is a common beginner mistake.  
* Not converting the input to `+1/-1` early can lead to confusing logic later.

### Article Body (excerpt)

---

#### Mastering LeetCode 3096: Minimum Levels to Gain More Points  
> *LeetCode interviewers love array problems that hide a simple greedy trick. Problem 3096 is a textbook “prefix‑sum vs. suffix‑sum” battle that can be solved in one pass. Below you’ll see the crisp algorithm, three idiomatic implementations, and interview‑ready discussion.*

---

#### Problem Restatement  
> *Given an array of `0` and `1`, determine the minimal prefix length that lets Alice out‑score Bob. Both players must play optimally, and each level gives +1 or –1.*

---

#### Quick Example Walk‑through  
> `possible = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`  
> 1. Alice plays 1 level → score = +1, Bob = total‑1 = ?  
> 2. After 3 levels → Alice = +1, Bob = …  
> *(Full step‑by‑step in the article.)*

---

#### Intuitive Approach  
> Alice’s score is the *prefix sum*; Bob’s is the *suffix sum*.  
> We need the earliest prefix where `Alice > Bob`.

---

#### Optimal O(n) Algorithm  
> Build `total` once, then scan while accumulating a running `prefix`.  
> When `prefix > total - prefix` we found the minimal prefix.

---

#### Code Implementation  

```java
class Solution { /* Java code */ }
```

```python
class Solution:  # Python code
    def minimumLevels(self, possible: List[int]) -> int:
        ...
```

```cpp
class Solution {  // C++ code
public:
    int minimumLevels(vector<int>& possible) { ... }
};
```

*(Show each snippet, highlight key lines.)*

---

#### Complexity & Performance  
| Language | Time | Space | Why it matters in interviews |
|----------|------|-------|------------------------------|
| Java | O(n) | O(1) | Handles 100k elements instantly |
| Python | O(n) | O(1) | No list or dictionary needed |
| C++ | O(n) | O(1) | Use `long long` for safety |

---

#### Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them  
* Bob must play at least one level.  
* Convert `0` to `-1` before summing.  
* Stop at `n‑2`.  
*(Explain each, link to “The Ugly” section above.)*

---

#### Take‑away & Interview Tips  
1. **Ask clarifying questions** – e.g., “Does Bob have to play a level?”  
2. **Explain the prefix‑sum idea first** – shows you can reason about totals.  
3. **Mention time/space trade‑offs** – even though O(n) is optimal here, brute‑force is O(n²).  

---

#### Bonus: How to Use This Problem in Your Resume  
* “Implemented an optimal O(n) algorithm for *Minimum Levels to Gain More Points* (LeetCode 3096). Reduced runtime from O(n²) to O(n) and demonstrated effective use of prefix sums.”  
* Add a “Technical Projects” section: “Coding Interview Prep – solved 30+ LeetCode problems in Java, Python, C++.”

#### Final Thoughts & Resources  
* LeetCode editorial, community solutions, and discussion threads.  
* Books: *Cracking the Coding Interview*, *Elements of Programming Interviews*.  
* Next challenge: *Array 2D Prefix Sum* problems on LeetCode or HackerRank.
