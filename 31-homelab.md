# Pi hawks

Took a break from printing the crane to print cases for the pis that will power the drones instead.

# Pip Boy 

Need a better boost converter to make this mobile again... so waiting till monday...

# RC Crane / Vertical Farming

Back to printing parts for the crane now that we have the pi cases for the pi hawks.

# Sub X (Hi Elon)

The goal it create a mesh tastic network across the oceans using a fleet or RC submarines and boats. 

Well really it will be barges and Buoys but still it would be great for humanity to have autonomous water expoloration. 

It will be good preparation for when we raech out into the stars further as well.

I designed a person sized submarine in highschool for a friend using Google Sketchup. But never got to make it because I had to leave from FL to VA.... This time we will be using something much smaller and designed by someone else...

* [Phase 0](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4560120)
* [Phase 1](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4575440)

After we have a few working sub prototypes we will attempt to make automous delivery vehicles for Navy Seals and other divers.

The goal is that anyone stranded on an island anywhere or trapped anywhere in the ocean can be found withing a small timeframe.

If they have a radio or any communcation device they will be able to greatly speed up their rescue as we daisy chain that back to the Coast Guard or search and rescue operators.

# RC Boats

Obviously making some RC boats and planes to go with my crazy adventure above! Really want to make an AI that can design RC models for Military craft and then have a production line that auto prints them.

# The Bastard's Bible...

A book that I have been working on for many years. For the fatherless and the motherless to know what the world is like and how to navigate it...

```
The book begins:

My Dear Children, I am very anxious that you should know something about the History of Jesus Christ. For everybody ought to know about Him. No one ever lived who was so good, so kind, so gentle, and so sorry for all people who did wrong, or were in any way ill or miserable, as He was.[1]
There then follows a simple account of Jesus's life and teachings, with an occasional touch of Dickens's humour:

You never saw a locust, because they belong to that country near Jerusalem, which is a great way off. So do camels, but I think you have seen a camel. At all events, they are brought over here, sometimes; and if you would like to see one, I will show you one.
```

- The Life of Our Lord

Thank you God... if I have done anything good in this life it is because of You and you alone... I am but a Lord of flies in comparison...

I hope I have a chance to finish my 5 rings some day...

# Book Summmary Zero to One: Summary & Key Concepts

It has been a while since I read this book. I think it was like 2015... so I asked Chat GPT to summarize it again...

## The Core Premise

Zero to One is about creating new technology and ideas rather than scaling existing ones.

- “Going from 1 to n” = copying something that already works.
- “Going from 0 to 1” = doing something unprecedented that changes the landscape.

## Major Themes and Arguments

1. Contrarian Truths
Thiel challenges readers to ask:
“What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”
True innovation often starts with beliefs that look crazy to the majority but later prove transformative.
He sees consensus as the enemy of breakthroughs.
Connection to you: This resonates with your work on OSINT/defense tools (El Roi, GhostWire, FoeHammer). You’re pursuing niche, contrarian domains outside mainstream consumer SaaS.

2. Monopoly vs. Competition
Thiel’s provocative claim: “Competition is for losers.”
Great companies don’t fight rivals; they create monopolies through unique advantages (technology, brand, network effects, or scale).
He argues monopolies drive innovation because they have freedom and capital to think long-term.
Competitive markets, in contrast, grind companies down to zero profits.
Connection: Your desire to build modular, CIA-grade OSINT tools for defense could be framed as creating a monopoly in “field-ready OSINT,” a niche too specialized for giants but too critical to ignore.

3. Secrets
Progress comes from uncovering “secrets”—truths about the world that others dismiss or overlook.
Companies that win big usually begin with one secret insight others ignored.
Example: PayPal realized the future of payments could be built on email transfers, a secret most banks overlooked.
Connection: Your insight that real-time graph-based OSINT tools (Maltego-like, but modular and web-native) are missing in the defense ecosystem could be your “secret.”

4. The Role of Technology
Globalization = copying what works across the world.
Technology = building something fundamentally new.
Thiel argues true progress = technological progress, not just scaling.
Connection: Aligns with your belief in building advanced AI/defense tools (e.g., drones, surveillance detection, modular OSINT). You’re not just replicating Palantir—you’re innovating lightweight, real-time variants.

5. The Power Law
Startup success follows a power law distribution: one big win drives most returns, not a portfolio of small wins.
For founders, this means:
Pick an idea with massive upside.
Commit fully.
Don’t spread thin across many half-baked ventures.
Connection: You juggle many projects. Thiel would urge you to choose the one “power law” bet that could dominate and commit with full intensity.

6. Founders and Culture
Great companies are built around strong founders with vision, not committees.
A startup is like a cult: belief in the mission must be nearly fanatical.
Culture matters—clarity of purpose aligns the team when resources are scarce.
Connection: Your personal story (from homeless to FAANG engineer to defense startup founder) already reflects resilience and conviction—qualities Thiel highlights.

7. Building the Future
Thiel stresses the importance of long-term planning.
Contrary to Silicon Valley’s obsession with iteration and “lean startup,” he believes in definite optimism—having a clear vision of the future and working toward it.
He contrasts this with indefinite optimism (hope without a plan).
Connection: Your defense contracting roadmap and OSINT tool visions map well onto “definite optimism.” You’re not just iterating—you’re planning for a defense-focused future.

## Key Takeaways

- Don’t just build incrementally—create something fundamentally new (0 → 1).
- Seek monopoly, not competition—own your space.
- Look for secrets—insights others overlook.
- Choose a big bet—the power law rules all outcomes.
- Build with conviction, culture, and founder vision.
- Be a definite optimist—plan boldly for the future.
