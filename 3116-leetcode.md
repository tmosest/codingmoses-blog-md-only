        # 1. Solution Code

Below you’ll find three production‑ready implementations for **LeetCode 3116 – “Kth Smallest Amount With Single Denomination Combination”**.  
All three use the same idea:

1. **Inclusion–Exclusion** to count how many “valid” amounts are ≤ X.  
2. **Binary Search** on the answer space.  
3. 64‑bit arithmetic (Java `long`, Python `int`, C++ `long long`) to stay within limits.

> **Why this works**  
> Each denomination can be used infinitely many times, but coins of *different* denominations cannot be mixed.  
> For a fixed set `S` of denominations, every reachable amount is a multiple of  
> `lcm(S)` (least common multiple).  
> Inclusion–Exclusion lets us count the number of multiples of *any* lcm while avoiding double‑counting intersections.

## 1.1 Java (Java 17)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    /** Main entry‑point for LeetCode. */
    public long findKthSmallest(int[] coins, int k) {
        int n = coins.length;
        // All non‑empty subsets – 2^n - 1 possibilities
        List<Long> lcmList = new ArrayList<>(1 << n);

        // Pre‑compute lcm for every subset and remember its sign
        for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
            long lcm = 1;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                    lcm = lcm(lcm, coins[i]);
                }
            }
            // Inclusion–Exclusion sign: + for odd size, – for even size
            int bits = Integer.bitCount(mask);
            lcmList.add(bits % 2 == 1 ? lcm : -lcm);
        }

        long low = 1, high = Long.MAX_VALUE;   // high can be very large
        while (low < high) {
            long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (count(mid, lcmList) < k) {
                low = mid + 1;          // answer is larger
            } else {
                high = mid;             // answer may be mid or smaller
            }
        }
        return low;
    }

    /** Count how many amounts ≤ target are representable. */
    private long count(long target, List<Long> lcmList) {
        long cnt = 0;
        for (long lcm : lcmList) {
            cnt += target / lcm;   // negative lcm automatically subtracts
        }
        return cnt;
    }

    /** Classic gcd / lcm helpers that never overflow. */
    private long gcd(long a, long b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            long tmp = a % b;
            a = b;
            b = tmp;
        }
        return a;
    }

    private long lcm(long a, long b) {
        return a / gcd(a, b) * b;   // (a/gcd)*b never overflows 64‑bit
    }
}
```

*Why the code is safe*  
`a / gcd(a, b)` is performed first, so we never multiply two large numbers that could overflow.  
The search space is limited by `Long.MAX_VALUE`; the binary search stops when `low == high`, which is guaranteed to be the answer because the function `count(x)` is monotonic.

## 1.2 Python 3

```python
from math import gcd
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findKthSmallest(self, coins: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(coins)
        lcm_list = []

        # Pre‑compute lcm for every non‑empty subset
        for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
            l = 1
            for i in range(n):
                if mask & (1 << i):
                    l = l * coins[i] // gcd(l, coins[i])
            bits = bin(mask).count('1')
            lcm_list.append(l if bits % 2 == 1 else -l)

        def count(x: int) -> int:
            return sum(x // l for l in lcm_list)

        lo, hi = 1, 2 ** 63 - 1   # Python int is unbounded but we cap it
        while lo < hi:
            mid = (lo + hi) // 2
            if count(mid) < k:
                lo = mid + 1
            else:
                hi = mid
        return lo
```

*Python notes*  
* `int` is arbitrary‑precision, so we don’t worry about overflow.  
* `2**63-1` is used to mirror the Java long limit; the algorithm would still converge if we used an even larger bound.

## 1.3 C++ (C++17)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long findKthSmallest(vector<int>& coins, int k) {
        int n = coins.size();
        vector<long long> lcm_list;
        lcm_list.reserve(1 << n);

        // Pre‑compute lcm for each non‑empty subset
        for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
            long long l = 1;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                if (mask & (1 << i)) {
                    l = lcm(l, (long long)coins[i]);
                }
            }
            int bits = __builtin_popcount(mask);
            lcm_list.push_back(bits & 1 ? l : -l);
        }

        auto count = [&](long long x) {
            long long res = 0;
            for (long long l : lcm_list)
                res += x / l;          // negative l subtracts automatically
            return res;
        };

        long long lo = 1, hi = LLONG_MAX;
        while (lo < hi) {
            long long mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if (count(mid) < k) lo = mid + 1;
            else hi = mid;
        }
        return lo;
    }

private:
    // gcd / lcm helpers that avoid overflow
    long long gcd(long long a, long long b) {
        while (b) { long long t = a % b; a = b; b = t; }
        return a;
    }

    long long lcm(long long a, long long b) {
        return a / gcd(a, b) * b;   // (a/gcd)*b safe in 64‑bit
    }
};
```

## 2.1 Problem Overview

LeetCode 3116 – *Kth Smallest Amount With Single Denomination Combination* – gives you a set of **distinct** coin denominations and asks:

> *You have an infinite supply of each coin, but you cannot mix different denominations. What is the **k‑th smallest** amount that can be made?*

The constraints make this a classic “count‑by‑value” problem:

* `coins.length ≤ 15` – tiny enough to allow bit‑mask enumeration.  
* `coins[i] ≤ 25` – small coin values.  
* `k ≤ 2·10⁹` – the answer can be huge, up to `Long.MAX_VALUE`.

You have to produce an **exact** integer answer.

---

## 2.2 Why Brute Force Fails

A naive algorithm would:

1. Generate all multiples of each coin up to a huge bound.  
2. Merge them and sort.  
3. Pick the k‑th.

Even with a bound like `10⁹`, you would generate tens of millions of numbers – far too slow and memory‑intensive. Moreover, the answer might be far beyond any simple bound.

Hence we need a smarter counting approach.

---

## 2.3 The Insight: Inclusion–Exclusion + Binary Search

### 2.3.1 Inclusion–Exclusion

For any subset `S` of denominations, every reachable amount is a multiple of `lcm(S)` (least common multiple).  
If we count how many multiples of `lcm(S)` are ≤ X, we get `⌊X / lcm(S)⌋`.

But we cannot just sum over all subsets because a number that is a multiple of *both* `lcm(A)` and `lcm(B)` would be double‑counted.  
**Inclusion–Exclusion** fixes this:

```
count(X) = Σ (-1)^(|S|+1) * ⌊X / lcm(S)⌋
           over all non‑empty subsets S
```

The sign is **positive** when the subset size is odd, **negative** when even.

With `n ≤ 15`, there are at most `2ⁿ−1 = 32,767` subsets – trivial to pre‑compute.

### 2.3.2 Binary Search

`count(X)` is a non‑decreasing function.  
We can binary search for the smallest `X` such that `count(X) ≥ k`.  
Because `k` can be up to `2·10⁹`, the search space is large, but the log₂(2⁹) ≈ 32 iterations – fast.

The key is to use **64‑bit** arithmetic (`long long` / `long`) to avoid overflow.  
The lcm of up to 15 numbers, each ≤ 25, fits comfortably in 64‑bit:  
`25⁷ ≈ 6.1·10⁹`, and the product of all 15 is at most `25¹⁵ ≈ 9.3·10¹⁹` – still < `9.22·10¹⁸` (`Long.MAX_VALUE`).

## 2.4 Implementation Pitfalls (The Ugly)

| Pitfall | What Happens | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Overflow in lcm** | `a * b / gcd(a, b)` can overflow before division. | Compute `a / gcd(a, b)` first: `lcm = (a / gcd) * b`. |
| **High bound too low** | If you cap `high` at `k * max_coin`, you may miss the answer if it lies above. | Use `Long.MAX_VALUE` or `LLONG_MAX`. The algorithm still converges because we only need monotonicity, not an exact upper bound. |
| **Negative lcm sign** | Accidentally storing only positive lcm and then ignoring sign leads to over‑counting. | Store each lcm with its sign (±). `count(X)` then uses `X / lcm` directly; a negative lcm automatically subtracts. |
| **Time‑outs in Python** | Summing over 32k lcm values in each iteration is fine, but using `2**63-1` as upper bound leads to big integers that are slow. | Keep the bound small (e.g., `2**63-1`) and let Python’s int handle any overflow. |

---

## 2.5 Why the Approach is Optimal

* **Pre‑computation**: 32k lcm values → O(2ⁿ) ≈ 10⁴ operations.  
* **Counting**: `O(2ⁿ)` divisions per `count(X)`.  
* **Binary Search**: 64 iterations × 32k divisions ≈ 2 million integer divisions – sub‑second in any language.

Memory consumption is negligible: we store only the lcm list (~64 kB).  
Hence the solution is *optimal* given the constraints.

---

## 2.6 Common Interview Mistakes

| Mistake | Symptom | How to Avoid |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Assuming k‑th value equals `k * min_coin`. | Wrong when different denominations generate smaller gaps. | Use binary search with exact counting. |
| Mixing `int` and `long` in Java. | Overflow on lcm or mid calculation. | Keep everything in `long`. Compute `(a / gcd(a, b)) * b`. |
| Forgetting the sign in inclusion–exclusion. | Wrong answer for many test cases. | Explicitly store `±lcm` for each subset. |
| Using `int` for the search bound in C++. | `count(mid)` can overflow, causing undefined behaviour. | Use `LLONG_MAX` and careful lcm calculation. |

---

## 2.7 Takeaway: Build a Counting Function, Then Search

When faced with “k‑th smallest” under constraints that make enumeration impossible, the common pattern is:

1. **Count** – Build a fast monotonic function `f(x)` that tells you how many values ≤ x satisfy the property.  
2. **Binary Search** – Find the threshold where `f(x) ≥ k`.  

This strategy appears in problems like:

* K‑th divisible number (LeetCode 1794).  
* K‑th ugly number (LeetCode 264).  
* K‑th largest value in a matrix.

LeetCode 3116 is simply a variant that forces you to combine *different* subsets of coins. Mastering the inclusion–exclusion pattern will help you conquer many other “count‑by‑subset” puzzles.

## 2.8 Interview‑Friendly Checklist

| ✔ | Checklist Item |
|---|-----------------|
| ✅ | Use **bit‑mask** to enumerate all subsets (≤ 32k). |
| ✅ | Compute `lcm` safely: `a / gcd(a, b) * b`. |
| ✅ | Store each subset’s sign (`+` for odd size, `-` for even). |
| ✅ | Write a `count(x)` that iterates over the pre‑computed list. |
| ✅ | Binary search over `[1, Long.MAX_VALUE]` (or `LLONG_MAX`). |
| ✅ | Use `long`/`long long` everywhere in Java / C++. |
| ✅ | Test edge‑cases: `k = 1`, `k` at upper bound, single coin, all coins. |

## 2.9 Final Thoughts

LeetCode 3116 is a wonderful micro‑challenge that forces you to:

1. **Recognize** that counting by value is better than generating values.  
2. **Apply** Inclusion–Exclusion correctly.  
3. **Combine** the counting with a monotone search.

The resulting solution is clean, mathematically elegant, and runs in micro‑seconds on any modern CPU. Mastering this pattern will give you a powerful tool for your next coding interview.

Happy coding! 🚀
