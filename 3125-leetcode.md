        # 3125. **Maximum Number That Makes Result of Bitwise AND Zero** – A Deep‑Dive  
*(LeetCode, Medium)*  

> **Goal**  
> For a given `n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15)` find the largest integer `x` such that `x ≤ n` and  
> `x & (x+1) & … & n == 0`.

## TL;DR – The One‑liner

```
x = 2^⌊log₂(n)⌋ – 1
```

In Java/C++/Python this becomes:

| Language | Code |
|----------|------|
| **Java** | `return (1L << Long.SIZE-Long.numberOfLeadingZeros(n)) - 1;` |
| **C++**  | `return (1ULL << (63 - __builtin_clzll(n))) - 1;` |
| **Python** | `return (1 << n.bit_length() - 1) - 1` |

All run in **O(1)** time and **O(1)** memory.

## 1. Why Does It Work?

### 1.1. The “most significant bit” (MSB) rule

Take any number `n`.  
Let `p = 2^k` be the highest power of two that is **≤ n** – this is the value of the most significant bit set in `n`.

- For any `x ≥ p`, the MSB bit of `x` is **1**.
- For any `x < p`, that bit is **0**.

If we perform a bitwise AND over a consecutive range that includes **both** an `x ≥ p` and an `x < p`, the MSB of the result will become **0**.  

To make the *whole* AND zero we must force **every** bit to be 0.  
Once the MSB is zeroed, all lower bits are also zero because the AND of *any* consecutive integers that span a power‑of‑two boundary will always have all lower bits zeroed.  
That’s why we only care about the MSB.

### 1.2. Why `2^k – 1`?

`2^k – 1` is the largest number that has **all** bits below the MSB set to 1 and the MSB itself 0.  
Because it is < `p`, its AND with any larger number `≥ p` will zero the MSB (and thus the whole result).  
Moreover, it is the **maximum** such number because any larger value would have the MSB set to 1 and would never reach zero when ANDed with numbers that keep that bit 1.

---

## 2. The Three Implementation Paths

### 2.1. Straightforward Loop (O(log n))

```java
public long maxNumber(long n) {
    long msb = 1;
    while ((msb << 1) <= n) msb <<= 1;   // find 2^k
    return msb - 1;
}
```

Pros: Clear, no compiler intrinsics.  
Cons: Slightly slower, but still `O(log n)` (~50 iterations for 10^15).

---

### 2.2. Bit‑trick / builtin (O(1))

#### Java

```java
public long maxNumber(long n) {
    int k = 63 - Long.numberOfLeadingZeros(n);   // log₂(n)
    return (1L << k) - 1;
}
```

#### C++

```cpp
unsigned long long maxNumber(unsigned long long n) {
    int k = 63 - __builtin_clzll(n);              // log₂(n)
    return (1ULL << k) - 1;
}
```

#### Python

```python
def maxNumber(n: int) -> int:
    return (1 << (n.bit_length() - 1)) - 1
```

All of them use the compiler‑provided bit‑count helpers, making them truly constant‑time.

---

### 2.3. Brute‑Force (Never for production)

```python
def maxNumber(n):
    for x in range(n, 0, -1):
        if (reduce(lambda a,b: a & b, range(x, n+1))) == 0:
            return x
```

**Why avoid it?**  
`O(n)` time, fails the constraints (n can be 10^15). Included only for completeness.

## 3. Good, Bad & Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Time Complexity** | Constant‑time, no loops | O(log n) loop is fine for 10^15 | Brute‑force O(n) would time‑out |
| **Space Complexity** | O(1) | – | – |
| **Code Clarity** | Single line, uses bit_length | Slightly verbose but readable | The naive loop with many `if`s can be confusing |
| **Edge Cases** | Works for `n = 1` (returns 0) | None | None |
| **Language Features** | Built‑in bit ops | May need to cast to unsigned | None |
| **Potential Pitfalls** | Integer overflow in languages with 32‑bit ints (Java int) | Forgetting `long`/`unsigned long long` | None |

# LeetCode 3125 – Find the Largest X Where AND of [X, N] Is Zero

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Category:** Bit Manipulation, Mathematics  
**Tags:** #LeetCode #Bitwise #Interview #CodingInterview

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10¹⁵), return the maximum integer `x` such that

```
x ≤ n
x & (x+1) & … & n == 0
```

## Intuition

Think of binary representation.  
The key is the *most significant bit* (MSB) of `n`.  
Let `p = 2^k` be the highest power of two ≤ `n`.  
All numbers from `p` up to `n` have the MSB bit set to `1`.  
If we include any number `< p` in the range, the AND will clear that bit.  
The smallest number that guarantees that the MSB is cleared while still being the largest possible is `p - 1`.

Thus:

```
answer = 2^⌊log₂(n)⌋ – 1
```

## Complexity Analysis

*Time:* **O(1)** (constant, no loops).  
*Space:* **O(1)**.

## Implementations

### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public long maxNumber(long n) {
        int k = 63 - Long.numberOfLeadingZeros(n);
        return (1L << k) - 1;
    }
}
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    unsigned long long maxNumber(unsigned long long n) {
        int k = 63 - __builtin_clzll(n);
        return (1ULL << k) - 1;
    }
};
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        return (1 << (n.bit_length() - 1)) - 1
```

## Good, Bad & Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Speed** | Constant time | None | Brute‑force is unacceptable |
| **Readability** | One‑liner using built‑ins | None | Over‑complicated loops can obscure the logic |
| **Safety** | Handles 64‑bit range | Forgetting `long`/`unsigned long long` can overflow | None |

## Takeaway

The magic lies in the observation that the AND of consecutive numbers that cross a power‑of‑two boundary will always clear all lower bits.  
By simply returning the number just below the most significant power of two, we instantly satisfy the condition.

Good luck on your interviews!
