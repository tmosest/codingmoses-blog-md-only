        ## 3129. **Find All Possible Stable Binary Arrays I**  
*LeetCode – Medium*  

> **Goal** – Count how many binary arrays of length `zero + one` contain  
> exactly `zero` zeros, exactly `one` ones, and **no** sub‑array whose length
> is greater than `limit` contains only zeros **or** only ones.  
> The answer is required modulo `1 000 000 007`.

Below you’ll find working, idiomatic implementations in **Java, Python, and C++**,
followed by a full‑blown blog post that explains the algorithm, shows the
good, the bad, and the ugly, and is SEO‑optimized to help you land that
coding interview.

## 1. The DP Idea

A stable array is simply a binary string that never has a *run* of 0’s or 1’s
longer than `limit`.  
We can build the string from left to right and remember:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `i` | number of 0’s already placed |
| `j` | number of 1’s already placed |
| `t` | last bit that was placed (`0` or `1`) |
| `k` | length of the current run (1 … limit) |

When the last bit is `t`, the next block must be the *opposite* bit and can
have any length `k` from `1` to `limit` (as long as we do not exceed the
required numbers of 0’s or 1’s).

Thus

```
dp[i][j][t] = number of ways to build a prefix that uses
              i zeros, j ones, and ends with bit t
```

Transition (adding a block of length `k` of the opposite bit):

```
if t == 0:           // last bit was 0, add k 1’s
    dp[i][j+k][1] += dp[i][j][0]   for k = 1 … limit   and j+k ≤ one
else:                // last bit was 1, add k 0’s
    dp[i+k][j][0] += dp[i][j][1]   for k = 1 … limit   and i+k ≤ zero
```

The answer is `dp[zero][one][0] + dp[zero][one][1]` (modulo `MOD`).

**Complexities**

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| DP | `O(zero * one * limit)` | `O(zero * one * 2)` |

With the constraints (`≤ 200`) this is far below one million operations.

## 2. Reference Implementations

> **Note** – All solutions use 64‑bit integers (`long` / `int64`) and
> take the modulus `1_000_000_007` at every addition to avoid overflow.

### 2.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    private static final long MOD = 1_000_000_007L;

    public int numberOfStableArrays(int zero, int one, int limit) {
        // dp[i][j][t]  (t=0 → last bit 0, t=1 → last bit 1)
        long[][][] dp = new long[zero + 1][one + 1][2];
        // empty array – we can pretend the last bit was 0 or 1
        dp[0][0][0] = dp[0][0][1] = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i <= zero; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= one; j++) {
                // last bit was 0 → add 1's
                for (int k = 1; k <= limit && j + k <= one; k++) {
                    dp[i][j + k][1] = (dp[i][j + k][1] + dp[i][j][0]) % MOD;
                }
                // last bit was 1 → add 0's
                for (int k = 1; k <= limit && i + k <= zero; k++) {
                    dp[i + k][j][0] = (dp[i + k][j][0] + dp[i][j][1]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }

        return (int) ((dp[zero][one][0] + dp[zero][one][1]) % MOD);
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Python

```python
MOD = 1_000_000_007

class Solution:
    def numberOfStableArrays(self, zero: int, one: int, limit: int) -> int:
        # dp[i][j][t]  (t=0 → last bit 0, t=1 → last bit 1)
        dp = [[[0, 0] for _ in range(one + 1)] for _ in range(zero + 1)]
        dp[0][0][0] = dp[0][0][1] = 1

        for i in range(zero + 1):
            for j in range(one + 1):
                # last bit 0 -> add 1's
                for k in range(1, limit + 1):
                    if j + k <= one:
                        dp[i][j + k][1] = (dp[i][j + k][1] + dp[i][j][0]) % MOD
                    if i + k <= zero:
                        dp[i + k][j][0] = (dp[i + k][j][0] + dp[i][j][1]) % MOD

        return (dp[zero][one][0] + dp[zero][one][1]) % MOD
```

### 2.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    static const long long MOD = 1'000'000'007LL;

    int numberOfStableArrays(int zero, int one, int limit) {
        // dp[i][j][t] : i zeros, j ones, last bit t (0 or 1)
        vector<vector<array<long long,2>>> dp(zero+1, vector<array<long long,2>>(one+1, {0,0}));
        dp[0][0][0] = dp[0][0][1] = 1;

        for (int i=0;i<=zero;i++){
            for (int j=0;j<=one;j++){
                // last bit 0 -> add 1's
                for (int k=1;k<=limit && j+k<=one;k++){
                    dp[i][j+k][1] = (dp[i][j+k][1] + dp[i][j][0]) % MOD;
                }
                // last bit 1 -> add 0's
                for (int k=1;k<=limit && i+k<=zero;k++){
                    dp[i+k][j][0] = (dp[i+k][j][0] + dp[i][j][1]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        return (dp[zero][one][0] + dp[zero][one][1]) % MOD;
    }
};
```

All three solutions run in a fraction of a second on the maximum input
(`200,200,200`).

## 3. Blog Article – “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of LeetCode 3129”

> **Title**:  
> *“LeetCode 3129 – Find All Possible Stable Binary Arrays I – The Good, The Bad, The Ugly”*  

> **Meta description** (SEO‑friendly):  
> Master LeetCode 3129 with clear Java, Python, and C++ solutions. Learn DP tricks, time‑space trade‑offs, and interview insights to land your next coding job.

---

### 3.1 Introduction

> Ever stumbled on a problem that feels like a *binary string conundrum* and wondered how to tame it?  
> LeetCode 3129 – “Find All Possible Stable Binary Arrays I” – is a textbook example of a combinatorial DP problem that tests your ability to reason about **runs** and **modular arithmetic**.  

> In this post we’ll dissect the problem, explain the **dynamic programming** solution, provide three ready‑to‑copy implementations, and talk about what interviewers actually care about when they throw this problem at you.

---

### 3.2 Problem Recap (The Good)

1. **Exact counts** – we must use *exactly* `zero` zeros and `one` ones.
2. **Run restriction** – no consecutive block of the same bit can exceed `limit`.
3. **Modulo** – answers may be huge; we return them mod `10^9 + 7`.

The problem is a *binary-string counting* problem.  
The *good* part is that the constraints (`≤ 200`) keep the state space tiny, so a straightforward DP works in under a second.

---

### 3.3 Why a 3‑Dimensional DP Works (The Bad)

We might be tempted to use a 2‑dimensional DP `[zeros][ones]` and just remember how many of the last bits were the same.  
But that leads to an **O(n²·limit)** solution that is easy to get wrong – you need to keep track of the *current run length* as well.  

The cleanest formulation is:

```
dp[i][j][t]   // last bit t, i zeros, j ones
```

When we add a new block, we *force* the opposite bit and iterate over all allowed run lengths `k`.  
The transition is simple but has to be coded carefully, especially when the two loops (over `i` and `j`) intersect with the `k` loop – that’s where the **bad** bugs hide.

---

### 3.4 The Ugly – Modular Overflow & Edge Cases

- **Overflow** – 64‑bit is safe in Java/Python/C++, but you still have to mod at every addition.  
- **Empty Prefix** – we initialise `dp[0][0][0] = dp[0][0][1] = 1`.  
  Some people try to initialise only one of them and then branch on the first added bit, but that breaks symmetry and halves the answer.

- **Large `limit`** – if `limit > zero + one`, we should clamp it (`k ≤ limit`), otherwise we’ll waste a loop.

These small details are the *ugly* part that can cost you a failing test in a real interview.  

---

### 3.4 What Interviewers Want (The Ugly)

1. **Correctness** – be sure to test edge cases:  
   * `zero = 0`, `one = 0`  
   * `limit = 1` (alternating string)  
   * `limit = 200` (no restriction)

2. **Time‑Space Trade‑off** – show you can compress the DP into a 2‑D array plus an auxiliary array if you’re tight on memory.  
   *Explain why you chose a 3‑D DP – readability vs. optimization.*

3. **Big‑O Talk** – recruiters love hearing “I know the time complexity is *O(n²·limit)*, so this will run fast enough.”  
   *Mention that you can also pre‑compute the possible block lengths to save a few cycles.*

4. **Modular Arithmetic** – many candidates forget to mod after each addition.  
   *Demonstrate a helper function `addMod(a,b)` to keep code clean.*

5. **Coding Style** – clean variable names, avoid magic numbers, keep the modulus constant at the top.  
   *Shows professionalism and readiness for real‑world codebases.*

---

### 3.5 Final Thoughts (The Good)

> LeetCode 3129 is **not** a “hard” problem; it’s a *well‑structured DP* that you can solve confidently if you keep the state explicit.  
> Once you master this pattern, you’ll see it appear in many other counting problems – from “Number of Beautiful Subarrays” to “Unique Binary Strings With Constraints”.

> **Pro tip for interviews**:  
> After coding, walk the interviewer through a **sample DP table** (e.g. `zero=2, one=3, limit=2`).  
> Visual aids show that you understand the transitions, not just the code.

---

### 3.6 Call to Action

> **Got the solutions?**  
> Practice them, write your own version in the language you’re most comfortable with, and then explore variations:
> * If you add a third type of character (e.g. 2’s), how does the DP change?  
> * What if `limit` is 0?  
> * Can you derive a closed‑form combinatorial formula?  

> These follow‑up questions can wow an interviewer and demonstrate depth.

---

### 3.7 Closing

> Whether you’re applying at Google, Amazon, or a fast‑growing fintech, problems like 3129 are *show‑stoppers* on technical screens.  
> With the DP solution above, you’re ready to tackle it in Java, Python, or C++ – just pick the one your hiring team uses.

> **Good luck** – remember, *dynamic programming* is not just a technique; it’s a mindset that turns combinatorial chaos into order.
