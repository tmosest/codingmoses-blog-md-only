        ## 🚀 316 – **Remove Duplicate Letters**  
**Language‑agnostic solution** (Java, Python, C++) + **SEO‑friendly blog post**  
> *“The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly” – a deep‑dive into the algorithm that will help you ace your next interview.*

---

### 📌 Problem Summary (LeetCode 316)

> Given a string `s`, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears **once and only once**.  
> Return the **lexicographically smallest** result among all possible unique‑letter strings.

*Examples*  
- `s = "bcabc"` → `"abc"`  
- `s = "cbacdcbc"` → `"acdb"`

Constraints: `1 <= s.length <= 10⁴`, only lowercase English letters.

## ✅ The Algorithm in a Nutshell

| Step | Idea | Why It Works |
|------|------|--------------|
| **1. Record last occurrence** | `last[char] = index` | Allows us to know if a character will appear again later. |
| **2. Iterate through `s` with a stack** | Use a stack to maintain the current best sequence. | Stack gives O(1) push/pop and preserves order. |
| **3. Skip already‑used chars** | Maintain a `visited` set. | Ensures each character appears once. |
| **4. Greedy popping** | While `stack.top > curChar` **and** `curChar` will appear later, pop. | Replaces larger chars earlier with smaller ones if they can be re‑inserted later, giving lexicographically smaller string. |
| **5. Push current char** | Add `curChar` to stack and mark as visited. | Builds the final sequence. |
| **6. Join stack** | Return `''.join(stack)`. | Final answer. |

> The greedy popping rule is the heart of the solution – it guarantees the minimal lexicographical order while preserving uniqueness.

## 📚 Code Implementations

### 1️⃣ Python 3

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicateLetters(self, s: str) -> str:
        # 1. Remember last index of each char
        last = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(s)}
        
        stack: List[str] = []
        visited = set()
        
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c in visited:
                continue
            
            # 4. Greedy pop
            while stack and c < stack[-1] and i < last[stack[-1]]:
                removed = stack.pop()
                visited.remove(removed)
            
            stack.append(c)
            visited.add(c)
        
        return ''.join(stack)
```

### 2️⃣ Java 17

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public String removeDuplicateLetters(String s) {
        // 1. Last occurrence index
        int[] last = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            last[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] = i;
        }

        Deque<Character> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[26];

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            int idx = c - 'a';
            if (visited[idx]) continue;

            // 4. Greedy pop
            while (!stack.isEmpty() &&
                   c < stack.peekLast() &&
                   i < last[stack.peekLast() - 'a']) {
                char removed = stack.pollLast();
                visited[removed - 'a'] = false;
            }

            stack.addLast(c);
            visited[idx] = true;
        }

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : stack) sb.append(c);
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

### 3️⃣ C++17

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    std::string removeDuplicateLetters(std::string s) {
        // 1. Last occurrence map
        std::vector<int> last(26, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); ++i)
            last[s[i] - 'a'] = i;

        std::stack<char> st;
        std::vector<bool> inStack(26, false);

        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); ++i) {
            char c = s[i];
            if (inStack[c - 'a']) continue;

            // 4. Greedy pop
            while (!st.empty() &&
                   c < st.top() &&
                   i < last[st.top() - 'a']) {
                inStack[st.top() - 'a'] = false;
                st.pop();
            }

            st.push(c);
            inStack[c - 'a'] = true;
        }

        // 6. Build result
        std::string res;
        while (!st.empty()) {
            res.push_back(st.top());
            st.pop();
        }
        std::reverse(res.begin(), res.end());
        return res;
    }
};
```

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Python | Java | C++ |
|--------|--------|------|-----|
| **Time** | `O(n)` (single pass + O(1) stack ops) | `O(n)` | `O(n)` |
| **Space** | `O(1)` for last (26) + `O(n)` for stack | `O(1)` + `O(n)` for stack | `O(1)` + `O(n)` for stack |
| **Why `O(1)` for space?** | Only 26 lowercase letters → constant‑size auxiliary data structures. |

> The algorithm runs in linear time and uses linear space in the worst case (when the stack holds all distinct letters). For interviewers, highlighting the linear nature and the greedy stack trick is essential.

## 🎯 The Good

1. **Linear Time** – O(n) is unbeatable for `n ≤ 10⁴`.  
2. **O(1) Extra Space** – Thanks to the 26‑letter alphabet.  
3. **Elegant Greedy** – One line of logic (`c < stack.top() && i < last[stack.top()]`) captures the core idea.  
4. **Re‑usable Pattern** – The same stack + last‑index trick solves **[LeetCode 108](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subsequence-of-distinct-characters)**, **[LeetCode 269](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary)**, etc.  
5. **Clear Code** – Each language version is self‑contained and easy to read.

---

## ⚠️ The Bad (Common Pitfalls)

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **O(n²) naive removal** | Avoid nested scans; use a stack. |
| **Forgetting `last[stack.top]`** | Ensure you know if a popped char will appear later; otherwise you’d lose it permanently. |
| **Using recursion** | Recursion could blow the stack on 10⁴ length. |
| **Sorting the string** | Gives the right set of characters but not the minimal lexicographical order in the original sequence. |

> Recruiters love candidates who explain *why* they avoid these mistakes.

---

## 💥 The Ugly

1. **Hard‑to‑read popping condition**  
   *`while (stack && c < stack.back() && i < last[stack.back()])`*  
   – It looks terse, but the logic is subtle.  
2. **Corner cases with repeated letters**  
   Example: `"bbca"` – the algorithm must pop the first `'b'` to allow a `'c'` earlier.  
3. **Testing edge‑cases**  
   - All same letter: `"aaaa"` → `"a"`  
   - Already sorted: `"abcde"` → `"abcde"`  
   - Reverse sorted: `"edcba"` → `"abcde"` (requires popping all).  

A robust unit test suite is a *must‑have* for interview preparation.

## 🧪 Quick Test Harnesses

### Python

```python
def test():
    sol = Solution()
    assert sol.removeDuplicateLetters("bcabc") == "abc"
    assert sol.removeDuplicateLetters("cbacdcbc") == "acdb"
    assert sol.removeDuplicateLetters("bbca") == "abc"
    assert sol.removeDuplicateLetters("aaa") == "a"
    print("All tests passed.")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test()
```

### Java

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.removeDuplicateLetters("bcabc"));      // abc
        System.out.println(sol.removeDuplicateLetters("cbacdcbc"));   // acdb
    }
}
```

### C++

```cpp
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::cout << sol.removeDuplicateLetters("bcabc") << '\n';      // abc
    std::cout << sol.removeDuplicateLetters("cbacdcbc") << '\n';   // acdb
}
```

## 📖 Blog Post – “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly”

### Title  
**Remove Duplicate Letters – LeetCode 316: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (Stack‑Greedy Interview Technique)**

---

### Introduction

When recruiters search for “remove duplicate letters” or “LeetCode 316” they’re usually looking for *concise, clean code* that demonstrates a solid understanding of greedy algorithms and stack data structures. This article walks you through that perfect solution, dissects its strengths, acknowledges its weak spots, and shows you how to present it as a **career‑boosting interview nugget**.

---

### Problem Context

- **Typical interview question** – “Given a string, produce the lexicographically smallest unique‑letter sequence.”
- **Commonly appears in**: System design interviews, coding bootcamps, and technical hiring for software engineering roles.
- **Why it matters**: Demonstrates mastery of string manipulation, greedy strategies, and space‑time trade‑offs – all topics high‑yield for senior‑software‑engineer interviews.

---

### Why This Solution Wins

| ✔️ Feature | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Linear time** | Recruiters love O(n) – it shows you understand algorithmic limits. |
| **O(1) space** | Efficient memory usage is a non‑negotiable skill for large inputs. |
| **Stack + Greedy** | Elegant pattern that’s reusable in multiple problems (smallest subsequence, alien dictionary, etc.). |
| **Readable Code** | Clear comments and single‑purpose variables make your solution a breeze for hiring managers to audit. |

---

### The “Good”

- **Deterministic** – No random choice, guarantees minimal lexicographical order.  
- **Reusable** – The same “last occurrence + stack” scaffold applies to a family of problems (108, 269, 1209).  
- **Clean** – Two‑pass algorithm with O(1) operations per character.  
- **Scalable** – Handles maximum input size (`10⁴`) effortlessly.

### The “Bad”

- **Greedy pop rule is non‑obvious** – A newcomer might miss the `i < last[top]` part, leading to wrong results.  
- **Edge‑case awareness** – Forgetting to skip visited chars or mis‑calculating last indices yields subtle bugs.  
- **Test coverage** – Interviewers may ask for edge‑cases (all same letter, reverse sorted, random).  

### The “Ugly”

- **Stack‑to‑string conversion** – In Java, you need to iterate over the deque; in Python, converting a list to a string; in C++, you must reverse the stack.  
- **Boolean array vs. HashSet** – Trade‑off between readability (Set) and memory (bool array).  
- **Language‑specific boilerplate** – Each implementation requires a different syntax and minor adjustments (e.g., `deque` vs. `ArrayDeque` vs. `stack`).
