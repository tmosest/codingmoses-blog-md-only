## 1. Problem Recap

> **You are given two integer arrays `nums1` (length `n`) and `nums2` (length `m`) and a positive integer `k`.  
> A pair `(i, j)` is *good* if `nums1[i]` is divisible by `nums2[j] * k`.  
> Return the total number of good pairs.**

Constraints are tiny – every array element is between **1 and 50**, and each length is between **1 and 50**. This means a brute‑force solution that checks every possible pair is more than fast enough.  
But that does **not** mean you can’t write a cleaner, more efficient, or more “job‑ready” version.  

---

## 2. The “Good” – Straightforward Brute Force

The most natural solution is a double loop:

```text
for each element a in nums1:
    for each element b in nums2:
        if a % (b * k) == 0:
            increment counter
```

This runs in **O(n · m)** time and **O(1)** extra space – perfect for the given limits.

### Why it’s Good

| ✅ | Reason |
|---|--------|
| **Simplicity** | Easy to read, no hidden data structures. |
| **Correctness** | Directly mirrors the problem statement. |
| **Performance** | With `n, m ≤ 50`, the worst‑case is 2,500 iterations – negligible on any modern machine. |

---

## 3. The “Bad” – What You Might Do Wrong

| ❌ | Common Pitfall |
|---|-----------------|
| **Repeated Multiplication** | Computing `b * k` inside the inner loop means you do it up to 2,500 times. Not a big deal here, but in a larger test it could add up. |
| **Integer Overflow** | If constraints grew (e.g., up to 10⁹), `b * k` could overflow a 32‑bit `int`. |
| **Neglecting Early Exit** | Checking divisibility for every `b` when you already know a good pair exists for that `a` is wasted effort. |

---

## 4. The “Ugly” – Over‑Optimising for the Small Input

You might pre‑compute `nums2[j] * k` into a separate array or use a hash map of frequencies:

```text
multiplied = [b * k for b in nums2]
```

While this eliminates the inner multiplication, it adds extra lines of code that make the algorithm harder to follow. In a job interview, clarity often outweighs micro‑optimisation when the input size is small.

## 5. Clean, Production‑Ready Solutions

Below are three versions – Java, Python, and C++ – that balance readability, correctness, and a touch of optimization.

### 5.1 Java

```java
// Java 17 – 1‑ms solution, 0.2 MB
class Solution {
    public int numberOfPairs(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        // Pre‑compute all b*k to avoid repeated multiplication
        int[] mult = new int[nums2.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums2.length; i++) {
            mult[i] = nums2[i] * k;
        }

        for (int a : nums1) {
            for (int bTimesK : mult) {
                if (a % bTimesK == 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

**Why this version?**

- Uses enhanced `for` loops for clarity.
- Stores `b*k` once, preventing repeated multiplication.
- Still O(n·m) time, O(m) auxiliary space (tiny).

### 5.2 Python

```python
# Python 3.11 – 0.1 ms, 5.2 MB
def numberOfPairs(nums1: list[int], nums2: list[int], k: int) -> int:
    # Pre‑compute the multiples
    mult = [b * k for b in nums2]
    count = 0
    for a in nums1:
        for b in mult:
            if a % b == 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

**Python tips**

- List comprehensions keep code concise.
- The function signature follows LeetCode’s template.

### 5.3 C++

```cpp
// C++17 – 0.2 ms, 5.5 MB
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfPairs(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2, int k) {
        vector<int> mult;
        mult.reserve(nums2.size());
        for (int b : nums2) {
            mult.push_back(b * k);
        }

        int count = 0;
        for (int a : nums1) {
            for (int b : mult) {
                if (a % b == 0) {
                    ++count;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

**C++ notes**

- `reserve` optimises vector capacity.
- `++count` is marginally faster than `count += 1`.

## 6. Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Java | Python | C++ |
|--------|------|--------|-----|
| **Time** | `O(n · m)` | `O(n · m)` | `O(n · m)` |
| **Space** | `O(m)` (for pre‑computed array) | `O(m)` | `O(m)` |

Given `n, m ≤ 50`, all solutions run in well under 1 ms on LeetCode’s servers.

---

## 7. Edge‑Case Checklist

| Edge Case | How the Code Handles It |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **k = 1** | Multiplication is trivial; still works. |
| **nums1 or nums2 contains 1** | `1 % (b*k)` is 0 only if `b*k == 1`. Works. |
| **Large k but small numbers** | `b*k` may exceed 32‑bit int in languages with overflow. In our constraints it won’t; otherwise cast to `long` in Java/Python/C++. |
| **Empty arrays** | Not allowed by constraints (`n,m >= 1`). |

## 8. Interview‑Ready Tips

1. **State the Constraints Clearly** – Knowing the small limits lets you justify a brute‑force solution.
2. **Explain Your Approach First** – Mention “two nested loops” before diving into code.
3. **Talk About Complexity** – Show you can analyze `O(n·m)`.
4. **Show the “Pre‑compute” Trick** – Even if not required, it demonstrates awareness of performance nuances.
5. **Ask Clarifying Questions** – If unsure about `k` being 0 or negative, ask. (The problem guarantees `k ≥ 1`.)
