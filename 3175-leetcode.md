## 2.1 Introduction

If you’re preparing for a coding interview, **LeetCode 3175** is a classic medium‑level challenge that tests your understanding of queues, greedy reasoning, and one‑pass traversal. The problem asks you to identify the first player who wins **k consecutive games** in a tournament where players with higher skill always win.

In this post, I’ll walk through:

* The **intuition** behind the optimal algorithm.
* A **step‑by‑step implementation** in **Java, Python, and C++**.
* Common **gotchas** (“bad” aspects) and how to avoid them.
* A deeper dive into **edge cases** and “ugly” scenarios that might trip up naive solutions.

The goal is to give you a complete, interview‑ready answer that you can brag about on your résumé.

## 2.2 Problem Recap

```text
Input
  skills – int[]  (size n, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, all values unique)
  k      – int   (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9)

Output
  index of the player who first wins k consecutive games
```

> Example  
> skills = [4, 2, 6, 3, 9], k = 2 → output: 2

The tournament mechanics:

1. Two front‑most players play.
2. Higher skill stays at the front.
3. Loser moves to the back.
4. Repeat until someone wins **k** straight games.

## 2.3 The “Good” – One‑Pass Greedy Insight

### 2.3.1 Why Greedy Works

At any point, the current front‑player (`leader`) is the strongest among all players that have *ever* faced each other. If a new player arrives (`i`) and has a higher skill, the current leader can never win again. Therefore:

* The winner after `i` becomes the new leader.
* The streak of consecutive wins resets to **1** (the new leader just won against the old one).
* If the new player is weaker, the leader simply extends its streak.

The crucial observation: **We only need to track the current leader and how many games it has won in a row.** No need to simulate the entire queue.

### 2.3.2 Algorithm Sketch

```
leader = 0          // index of current front
streak = 0          // consecutive wins of leader

for each i from 1 to n-1:
    if skills[i] > skills[leader]:
        leader = i
        streak = 1
    else:
        streak += 1

    if streak == k:  // winner found
        break

return leader
```

The algorithm terminates early as soon as a streak reaches `k`, which is guaranteed because the strongest player will eventually win `k` times when `k ≤ n-1`. For `k > n-1`, the strongest player still wins the tournament (no other can beat it).

## 2.4 The “Bad” – Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Happens | How to Fix |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| **Using a real queue** | A naïve simulation pushes and pops O(n) elements, leading to O(n) space and higher constant factor. | Use the greedy counter; no queue needed. |
| **Assuming k ≤ n-1** | Problem constraints allow `k` up to `10^9`. | Early exit if streak reaches `k`; otherwise, the maximum streak is `n-1`. |
| **Off‑by‑one errors** | Starting `streak` at `0` or `1` incorrectly counts the first win. | Start at `0`; increment after each comparison. |
| **Integer overflow** | Not an issue with given constraints but always be mindful when `k` is huge. | No arithmetic beyond comparisons; safe. |
| **Wrong type (long vs int)** | For Java/C++/Python, `int` is sufficient; `long` only needed if `k` > `2^31-1`. | Keep everything as `int` unless the platform requires `long`. |

## 2.5 The “Ugly” – Edge Cases That Can Break Simple Solutions

1. **Two Players, Huge `k`**  
   *skills = [1, 2], k = 1,000,000,000*  
   In a deque simulation, the loop will run forever because the winner keeps moving to the front each round. The greedy algorithm solves it in one pass: the strongest player (`index 1`) will win the first game, streak = 1, and the loop ends because the maximum streak is `n-1 = 1`.

2. **Strongest Player at the End**  
   *skills = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 3*  
   The greedy counter still works because every time a new stronger player arrives, the streak resets.

3. **Very Large `k` but Small `n`**  
   *skills = [10, 20], k = 500*  
   The algorithm terminates after the first comparison because the strongest player will have streak `1` and can’t reach `k`. According to the problem, when `k > n-1`, the player with maximum skill wins. Our code automatically returns the leader at the end of the loop (which is the strongest).

4. **Non‑unique Skills (contrary to constraints)**  
   If skills were not unique, you’d have to decide tie‑breaking. The greedy logic still holds as long as you break ties consistently.

## 2.6 Complexity Analysis

| Language | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| Java     | O(n) | O(1)  |
| Python   | O(n) | O(1)  |
| C++      | O(n) | O(1)  |

The algorithm is linear in the number of players and uses only a handful of variables. It also stops as soon as the winning streak is achieved, making it **optimal for interviewers who love concise, efficient code.**

## 2.7 Why This Matters for Your Resume

* **Algorithmic thinking** – You’ll showcase greedy + one‑pass optimization.
* **Multi‑language proficiency** – Demonstrating Java, Python, and C++ implementations shows versatility.
* **Space & Time efficiency** – Interviewers often ask for the “best” solution; O(n) time & O(1) space is a clear winner.
* **Problem tags** – Queue, greedy, one‑pass, job interview, coding interview.

If you want to stand out, add a note in your résumé or portfolio:

## 2.8 Final Takeaway

The LeetCode 3175 problem is a neat example of **“look‑ahead greedy”**. By recognizing that the tournament’s only state that matters is the current leader and its streak, you avoid the heavy simulation and produce a clean, constant‑space solution.  

Keep the table of pitfalls in mind when you tackle similar “queue” problems: a queue is often a red herring. If you can reduce the problem to a simple counter, you’re usually on the right track.

Good luck with your coding interview! 🚀
