# Engineer...

Jesus Christ I fell asleep fully clothed with an electric screwdriver in my pocket lol...

Is that a banana or are you just happy to see me lol....

Just realized it was still there as it was spinning in my pocket now and I thought a 3D printer was banging into the wall...

# Warp Tour Terminal 

Chapt GPT started hullicinating because the project got too large so I am forced to actually learn to code... lol...

No I just learned to ask it smaller questions and rely on Gemini jk jk jk...

It now validates commands and makes them green like warp does or red if invalid.

The recommendation engine is having some issues. Fighting with CSS positioning...

# Lost Dog, The Dog of Tacoma...

Its time to make "The Dog of Tacoma"... there was another lost dog out while I walking the streets...

I wanna make a simple web app that allows people to upload a description or photo and share it with their friends.

This information could be shared with the drone search and rescue software I am working on as well.

This could also feed into Bruiser's Bill Bot... my attempt to make a robot dog that can take dogs on walk and bring WALLE to clean up the waste...

This is super simple thanks for asking... but I don't know if I want to pay BIG PIMP DADDY BEZOS's electric bill or risk being hacked by china... lol...

# The Prince of Egypt

A Treatise on Power, Vision, and Founding for the Modern Age

## Dedication

To those who see the world not as it is, but as it might be—
To those who believe that from dust and exile, empires are raised—
To the builders of new orders, who dare to walk against the tide of men.

// TODO THE GREAT SEAL OF AMERICA WITH MOSES

## Chapter I – On Founding

Every kingdom is either inherited or made. The first requires birthright; the second, blood, labor, and vision. The prince who inherits power commands loyalty only as long as fortune favors him. But the prince who rises from nothing bends reality by his will; his rule is stronger, for it is forged in exile and trial.

The Scriptures themselves testify: “Do not despise these small beginnings, for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin” (Zechariah 4:10). From the shepherd fields of David to the basket of Moses drifting on the Nile, from Gideon who called himself “the least of my family” to the Christ born in a manger—God delights to raise leaders out of obscurity. What men overlook, heaven ordains.
Thus, the prince of Egypt must not be ashamed of exile, obscurity, or wilderness. For it is in the wilderness that vision is clarified, in exile that strength is tempered, in small beginnings that trust is proven. “Whoever is faithful in very little will also be faithful in much” (Luke 16:10).

So it is with founders: the monopoly is not won by the heir of institutions, but by the one who sees a secret hidden from the multitude. In this way, the contrarian becomes king. And as Machiavelli wrote, it is better to build anew than to patch what is decayed—for the world remembers not the caretaker, but the founder.

History confirms this pattern. Genghis Khan, abandoned and exiled as a boy, rose to unite tribes and command the steppes. Napoleon, an obscure Corsican, remade Europe. Michelangelo, rejected by his father, carved his legitimacy in marble. Aesop, born a slave, turned wisdom into fables sharper than any sword. Even Peter Thiel, disillusioned by law and finance, began again with PayPal and Palantir, bending data itself to his design.

And in our own age, Robert Greene stands as a founder of counsel. Born without inheritance, wandering through odd jobs and obscurity, he distilled the strategies of princes into modern form. The 48 Laws of Power, Mastery, The Laws of Human Nature—these are not thrones of stone, but thrones of knowledge. Greene rules by story and strategy, as Machiavelli once did in Florence. 

His power is subtler: he arms leaders, CEOs, artists, and politicians with the weapons of history, turning exiles into rulers and wanderers into founders.

Therefore, let no prince despise humble beginnings. Whether through the sword, the chisel, the story, or the pen, founding power arises not from inheritance but from vision sharpened in rejection. The hand that builds, not the hand that inherits, is the true mark of the prince.

### Robert Greene: A Modern Prince of Counsel

##### Early Life & Wanderings

Robert Greene was born in 1959 in Los Angeles, California. Unlike the dynastic figures of history, Greene did not inherit a throne, a family business, or even a clear career path. He studied at UC Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin, earning a degree in classical studies — but far from becoming an academic, he entered a period of wandering.

Over the next decade, Greene worked more than fifty different jobs: construction worker, translator, Hollywood assistant, magazine editor, and more. These were not glamorous roles; they were often dead ends. Yet, like Moses in the wilderness or Aesop in slavery, Greene’s time in obscurity sharpened his observation of human behavior.

Lesson: Obscurity is not wasted. Wandering years, far from being failures, can be the foundation of mastery if one observes, reflects, and gathers knowledge.

#### The Breakthrough: The 48 Laws of Power

In the mid-1990s, while working in media, Greene conceived the idea of distilling the strategies of history’s rulers, generals, and thinkers into a single text. In 1998, The 48 Laws of Power was published.

The book was polarizing: some condemned it as manipulative or cynical, but others — CEOs, artists, athletes, political leaders — embraced it as brutally honest. Like Machiavelli’s The Prince, Greene’s work was not prescriptive morality but descriptive reality. It revealed the hidden rules that govern ambition and power.

Lesson: Mastery often comes from saying what others are unwilling to say. Greene’s contrarian insight was that people crave honesty about power, even if it offends polite society.

#### Expanding the Canon: From Power to Mastery

Greene followed his first success with a series of books that broadened his scope:

- The Art of Seduction (2001) — power through attraction and influence.
- The 33 Strategies of War (2006) — power through conflict and strategy.
- The 50th Law (2009, with 50 Cent) — power through fearlessness.
- Mastery (2012) — power through lifelong learning, apprenticeship, and skill.
- The Laws of Human Nature (2018) — power through understanding psychology.

Together, these form a modern canon of counsel, a companion to Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and Aesop.

Lesson: True mastery is not a single book or achievement, but a lifetime of building a body of work — each piece deepening and expanding the last.

#### Greene’s Method: The Historian as Strategist

Greene’s mastery lies not only in his writing but in his method:

1. He studies patterns across centuries, drawing lessons from Napoleon, Caesar, Cleopatra, Goethe, and Darwin.
2. He distills timeless principles from diverse lives.
3. He speaks in maxims and laws, making complex insights portable and memorable.

Lesson: In our own pursuits, we must learn to see beyond immediate circumstances. By studying patterns in history, we become less bound by the illusions of the present.

#### What We Can Learn for Our Own Pursuit of Mastery

1. Endure the wilderness. Like Greene’s decades of odd jobs, our wandering years can be the soil of insight if we stay observant.
Say what others won’t. Contrarian truths — whether about power, technology, or society — often become the foundations of lasting work.

2. Build a body of knowledge. Mastery isn’t one victory, but a lifetime of refining, expanding, and codifying insight.
3. See the timeless. Study the patterns of history and human behavior; mastery comes from connecting today’s struggles with ancient truths.
4. Counsel is power. You need not wield armies to shape kings; those who interpret, teach, and codify wisdom wield a subtler, but no less durable, form of rule.

#### Closing Thought

Robert Greene reminds us that mastery is not born of smooth roads but of wandering, rejection, and relentless study. He stands in the lineage of Machiavelli and Aesop — a counselor to princes and founders. His life is proof that obscurity and rejection can be transmuted into authority, if one dares to see patterns others ignore and to write them with clarity.

### Eminem: A Prince of Voice and Defiance

#### Early Life & Exile

Marshall Bruce Mathers III, better known as Eminem, was born in 1972 in St. Joseph, Missouri, and raised in Detroit. His beginnings were marked by poverty, instability, and rejection.

He grew up in a broken home, abandoned by his father, and raised by a struggling mother.

He lived on the edge of poverty, moving constantly, bullied in school, and often treated as an outsider in the predominantly Black Detroit rap scene.

He dropped out of high school at 17, working menial jobs to survive while chasing a music career.

Like Aesop the slave or David the shepherd boy, Eminem began with no inheritance, no legitimacy, and no allies. His exile was social and cultural — an outcast in his own world.

Lesson: Exile and rejection can sharpen voice; obscurity often births authenticity.

#### The Breakthrough: The Slim Shady LP

After years of underground battles and local mixtapes, Eminem was discovered by Dr. Dre in 1997. His major-label debut, The Slim Shady LP (1999), shocked the world.

His lyrics were raw, violent, confessional, and satirical.

He spoke from the margins: poverty, addiction, broken families, anger, and survival.

The album won a Grammy and launched him into global fame.

Like Machiavelli’s The Prince, Slim Shady was controversial, condemned by some as corrupting and immoral — yet it became indispensable reading (or listening) for a generation hungry for honesty.

Lesson: Mastery often comes from saying what others won’t dare to say.

#### Cultural Monopolies

Eminem didn’t just compete in hip-hop — he monopolized his lane by creating something no one else could replicate:

He brought white working-class rage and pain into hip-hop without imitation, but with authenticity.

He mastered the art of rhyme schemes, double meanings, and rapid-fire delivery, setting a technical bar few could reach.

His alter-egos (Slim Shady, Marshall Mathers, Eminem) gave him multiple lenses through which to speak, allowing him to embody contradiction without losing credibility.

In Thiel’s terms, he went “Zero to One”: he didn’t copy, he innovated. He built a monopoly on his own voice.

Lesson: To win, don’t imitate. Find the voice only you can deliver — and make it undeniable.

#### Struggle & Mastery

Eminem’s career has been marked not only by success but by cycles of collapse and rebirth:

Addiction and near-death experiences in the mid-2000s nearly ended his career.

His recovery albums (Relapse, Recovery) turned his personal battle into art.

Even in decline, he returned sharper, proving resilience is as much a part of mastery as talent.

Like biblical kings who fell and rose again, Eminem’s arc shows that mastery is not linear — it is forged through struggle, relapse, and return.

Lesson: Mastery is not the absence of failure, but the power to rise after it.

#### What We Can Learn in Our Pursuit of Mastery

Own your exile. Outcasts often see truths insiders ignore; use rejection as fuel.

Say the unspeakable. Eminem broke through by voicing pain, rage, and taboo subjects others avoided.

Make your voice a monopoly. Don’t compete on imitation; build on what only you can bring.

Turn wounds into weapons. Trauma and hardship can become the raw material of art and innovation.

Resilience is mastery. Collapse is not the end; the power to return is part of greatness.

#### Closing Thought

Eminem is proof that princes can rise not from palaces but from trailer parks, not from inheritance but from defiance. His mastery is not in armies or technology, but in voice: the ability to seize a culture’s ear and say what it doesn’t want to hear but cannot ignore. He stands with Aesop, Greene, and Michelangelo as a founder of cultural empires — one whose throne is the microphone, and whose crown is the raw power of words.

### Peter Thiel: A Modern Prince of Contrarian Power

#### Early Life & Formation

Peter Andreas Thiel was born in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1967. His family emigrated to the United States when he was a child, settling first in Cleveland, then California. Unlike dynastic heirs, Thiel did not come from old American wealth or political families. Instead, his inheritance was more subtle: a classical education, intellectual rigor, and the restless mind of an outsider.

He studied philosophy at Stanford, and later law, winning recognition for his sharpness but finding little satisfaction in the conventional paths of law and finance. For a time he clerked and worked in banking, but he felt trapped in institutions that were powerful yet stagnant. This disillusionment was his exile — like Moses in Midian or Michelangelo under his father’s rejection. He realized he would need to found his own path.

Lesson: Exile is often intellectual before it is physical. Discontent with convention is the first step toward mastery.

#### The Breakthrough: PayPal

In 1998, Thiel co-founded Confinity, which later merged with Elon Musk’s X.com to become PayPal. At the time, most dismissed the idea of sending money through email as absurd. But Thiel saw a secret others ignored: digital cryptography could make new forms of trust possible.
PayPal was not simply a startup — it became the seedbed of a generation. The “PayPal Mafia” (Musk, Reid Hoffman, Max Levchin, etc.) went on to found LinkedIn, YouTube, Tesla, SpaceX, Yelp, Palantir, and more.

Lesson: A true founder doesn’t just create a company — he creates a network of future founders.

#### Palantir: The Power of Data

In 2003, Thiel founded Palantir, applying PayPal’s fraud-detection methods to intelligence and counterterrorism in the wake of 9/11.
Palantir embodied Thiel’s Machiavellian streak:

It operated in secrecy.

It offered governments and corporations unprecedented surveillance and data integration power.

It was designed not just as a tool, but as an enduring institution.


Here, Thiel’s role mirrored princes who arm states with new technologies of power. Palantir was a sword made of data.
Lesson: Mastery often comes from recognizing when tools built for one field can be weaponized for another.

#### The Philosopher-Investor

Unlike many Silicon Valley peers, Thiel is not merely a capitalist — he is a philosopher-capitalist. His worldview shapes his strategy:

He is skeptical of globalization (1→n), preferring true innovation (0→1).

He believes monopolies, not competition, create lasting value.

He argues for definite optimism — planning boldly for the future, instead of drifting in “indefinite” hope.

This intellectual foundation sets him apart. Like Robert Greene distilling laws of power, Thiel distills laws of innovation. His book Zero to One (2014) functions as a modern founding text, akin to Machiavelli’s The Prince, teaching how to create, not copy.

Lesson: Mastery requires philosophy. Without a worldview, action is scattered; with one, it is sharpened into strategy.

#### Influence & Legacy

Thiel’s influence extends far beyond his own ventures:

- As an investor: early in Facebook, SpaceX, and other giants.
- As an intellectual: funding heterodox thinkers, students, and startups.
- As a political figure: backing contrarian movements and challenging consensus.

Like Machiavelli, his admirers and critics both acknowledge his role as a shaper of princes — through capital, counsel, and contrarianism.
Lesson: A founder’s true legacy is not the company he builds, but the institutions, ideas, and networks that endure beyond him.

#### What We Can Learn for Our Own Pursuit of Mastery

Embrace exile. Disillusionment with conventional paths can be the signal you are meant to found, not inherit.
Seek secrets. Look for truths hidden in plain sight — ideas others dismiss as absurd or impossible.

Build networks, not just companies. The PayPal Mafia shows that the ripple effects of one founding moment can shape entire eras.

Arm with new tools. Palantir proves mastery comes from adapting technology into weapons of power.
Adopt definite optimism. Plan the future with clarity and conviction; drift belongs to those who inherit, not to those who found.

#### Closing Thought

Peter Thiel stands as a modern Prince of Contrarian Power. His path mirrors the exiled founders of history: rejecting convention, uncovering hidden truths, and building institutions that shift civilizations. Like Machiavelli and Greene, he codifies principles of mastery. Like Moses and Aesop, he rose not from inheritance but from exile. His lesson to us is clear: to found is to see what others cannot, and to build it with absolute conviction.

### The Basket and the Water: Princes of Fragile Beginnings

#### Moses – The Child of the Nile

Born under Pharaoh’s decree to kill Hebrew boys, Moses’ mother hid him in a reed basket and set him afloat on the Nile (Exodus 2).
What looked like abandonment was providence: Pharaoh’s daughter drew him out, giving him a name and a future.
Moses would later draw Israel out of Egypt — his destiny mirrored his beginnings.

Lesson: Fragile starts can foreshadow great deliverance.

#### David – The Overlooked Shepherd

When Samuel came to anoint a king, Jesse presented his sons — but left David in the fields, not even considering him worthy (1 Samuel 16).
He was the “basket child” of his family — overlooked, underestimated, yet chosen by God.
From sling and stone to throne, his rise shows that greatness often hides in the margins.

Lesson: Rejection by men is not rejection by God.

#### Jesus – Born in a Manger

The Savior of the world was not born in palaces but laid in a feeding trough (Luke 2).
His family fled as refugees into Egypt to escape Herod’s massacre — like Moses, his infancy was marked by danger and exile.
The King of kings began life in poverty, obscurity, and threat.

Lesson: Divine power often enters history through weakness and vulnerability.

#### Joseph – Cast into the Pit

Hated by his brothers, Joseph was thrown into a pit and sold into slavery (Genesis 37).
Like being set adrift in a basket, he was abandoned to chance — yet rose to become second only to Pharaoh.
What was meant for evil became the means of salvation.

Lesson: The pit is often the prelude to the palace.

#### Sargon of Akkad – The Ancient Parallel

An ancient Mesopotamian tale mirrors Moses: Sargon, the founder of Akkad, claimed he was set adrift as a baby in a basket of reeds on a river.
Rescued by a water-drawer, he rose to rule Mesopotamia.
This story shows the basket-symbol is nearly universal: empires often begin in fragility.

Lesson: The “basket child” archetype transcends cultures.

#### Romulus and Remus – Founders of Rome
Twin infants, abandoned by the river Tiber, placed in a trough-like basket and left to die.
Rescued and suckled by a she-wolf, they grew to found Rome.
Another story of fragility → empire.

Lesson: Even civilizations of iron may begin in reed baskets.

#### Common Pattern

1. Fragile Start – Basket, manger, pit, abandonment.
2. Preservation by Providence – Someone rescues, intervenes, or circumstances shift.
3. Exile and Hardship – Shepherd fields, slavery, refugee flight.
4. Rise to Founding – Deliverance, kingdom, empire, salvation.

### Why the Basket Symbol Matters

- The basket is weakness, fragility, obscurity.
- The water is chaos, danger, uncertainty.
- To be drawn out is to be chosen.
- The “basket child” is the archetype of the Exiled Prince: one who begins rejected and powerless, but rises to found nations, empires, and movements.

### Conclusion: The Basket and the River

The beginning of greatness is often a basket set upon a river. Fragile, makeshift, and unfit for the chaos it floats upon, the basket carries no strength of its own. It is reeds bound together with pitch, nothing more. Yet within it lies a destiny the world cannot yet see.

The river is vast, restless, and merciless. It swallows armies, cities, and empires without remorse. The Nile cradled Pharaoh’s wealth even as it received the bodies of Hebrew children cast into it. The same water that sustains life is also the grave of the innocent. In this way, fortune is like the river: it lifts and destroys with equal power, showing no preference for justice or cruelty.

Moses began here, drawn out by hands that were not his own. So too did David, the forgotten shepherd boy left in the fields, whose family saw him as unworthy of kingship. So too did Joseph, thrown into a pit and sold into slavery, his life as discarded as a basket on foreign waters. So too did Jesus, born not into palaces but into poverty, laid in a manger, and driven into exile before he could speak. Each began adrift, fragile and overlooked, yet chosen.

The lesson of the basket is that beginnings are not strong, but providential. What protects the child is not the reeds, but the hand of God and the unseen currents of destiny. Yet the river remains — threatening, unpredictable, and always near. The basket prince must never forget that the waters which carried him to safety could just as easily have swallowed him.

If he grows proud and believes his rise was by strength alone, the river will return in flood. If he forgets the fragility of the basket, he will be overturned. But if he remembers his beginnings, if he honors the weakness from which he rose, he may one day stand at the river’s edge and command its waters to part.

The basket is humility, destiny, and fragility. The river is fortune, chaos, and threat. Together they form the paradox of all who rise from obscurity: to float upon waters stronger than themselves, trusting in providence until the day comes when they, too, are called to draw others out.
