        # 3208. Alternating Groups II – The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly  
*LeetCode – Medium – Sliding Window on a Circular Array*  

> **Goal:** Count how many contiguous groups of length **k** in a circular array of 0‑1 colors alternate (no two adjacent colors are the same).  
> **Input:** `int[] colors`, `int k`  
> **Output:** `int` – number of valid alternating groups  

Below you’ll find a clear, production‑ready solution in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++** (all O(n) time, O(1) extra space).  
After the code, a SEO‑optimized blog post explains the algorithm, pitfalls, and interview tips.

## Quick‑start Code

```java
// Java (LeetCode signature)
class Solution {
    public int numberOfAlternatingGroups(int[] colors, int k) {
        int n = colors.length;
        if (k > n) return 0;                     // impossible

        int ans = 0;   // number of alternating groups found
        int len = 1;   // current length of alternating run

        // Walk the circular array exactly once (n + k - 1 steps)
        for (int i = 1; i < n + k - 1; i++) {
            int cur  = colors[i % n];
            int prev = colors[(i - 1 + n) % n];

            // Start a new run if adjacent colors are the same
            if (cur == prev) len = 1;
            else             len++;

            // Every time the run reaches length k, it contains
            // a valid alternating group ending at position i
            if (len >= k) ans++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

```python
# Python 3
class Solution:
    def numberOfAlternatingGroups(self, colors: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(colors)
        if k > n:
            return 0

        ans, run = 0, 1
        # Walk the circular array n + k - 1 steps
        for i in range(1, n + k - 1):
            cur, prev = colors[i % n], colors[(i - 1) % n]
            run = 1 if cur == prev else run + 1
            if run >= k:
                ans += 1
        return ans
```

```cpp
// C++17
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfAlternatingGroups(vector<int>& colors, int k) {
        int n = colors.size();
        if (k > n) return 0;
        int ans = 0, run = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n + k - 1; ++i) {
            int cur  = colors[i % n];
            int prev = colors[(i - 1 + n) % n];
            run = (cur == prev) ? 1 : run + 1;
            if (run >= k) ++ans;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

> **Why `n + k - 1` iterations?**  
> The first `k-1` elements of the circular array are “wrapped” around to the end.  
> By iterating `n + k - 1` times we see every possible window exactly once.

### H1 – Alternating Groups II on LeetCode: A Deep Dive for Interview Prep

> **Keywords**: Alternating Groups II, LeetCode 3208, sliding window, circular array, interview question, Java, Python, C++, algorithm, time complexity, space complexity.

### H2 – Problem Overview

You are given a **circular** array `colors` of 0s and 1s.  
An **alternating group** of length `k` is a contiguous segment where every pair of adjacent tiles has different colors.  
Because the array is circular, the first and last elements are adjacent.

**Task**: Count how many such groups exist.

---

### H2 – Intuition & The Good

1. **Sliding Window**  
   - In a linear array, we would slide a window of size `k` and check if all adjacent pairs differ.  
   - Naïvely, that would be `O(nk)`.

2. **One‑pass, O(1) memory**  
   - Keep a variable `run` that records the length of the current alternating run.  
   - Whenever we see two equal adjacent colors, `run` resets to 1.  
   - When `run >= k`, the window ending at the current position is a valid alternating group.

3. **Circular Handling**  
   - Treat the array as if it were extended by `k‑1` elements at the end (`colors[0…k-2]`).  
   - No extra space: just use modulo arithmetic (`i % n`).

This yields a clean, **O(n)** algorithm with **O(1)** additional space – the perfect interview answer.

---

### H2 – Implementation Details

| Language | Core Loop | Modulo Trick |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Java** | `for (int i = 1; i < n + k - 1; i++)` | `colors[i % n]` |
| **Python** | `for i in range(1, n + k - 1):` | `colors[i % n]` |
| **C++** | `for (int i = 1; i < n + k - 1; ++i)` | `colors[i % n]` |

**Key Steps**  
1. `run = (cur == prev) ? 1 : run + 1;`  
2. `if (run >= k) ans++;`

**Edge Cases**  
- `k > n` → impossible, return 0.  
- `k == n` → whole array must alternate.  
- All elements the same → 0 groups.  
- All alternating → `n` groups (because each rotation forms a group).

---

### H2 – The Bad (Common Pitfalls)

1. **Ignoring Circularity**  
   - Using a simple `for i in range(k, n):` will miss windows that wrap around.  
   - *Fix*: extend logically by `k-1` steps.

2. **Off‑by‑One Errors**  
   - Mis‑counting the first window or mis‑handling the reset condition (`run = 1` vs `run = 0`).  
   - Verify with small tests (`[0,1,0], k=3` → 1 group).

3. **Wrong Reset Logic**  
   - Resetting `run` to `0` instead of `1` breaks the alternation count.  
   - The first tile of a new run is always part of a valid sequence of length 1.

---

### H2 – The Ugly (Why a “One‑Pass” is Surprising)

A naive two‑pass approach could be:

```python
for i in range(n):
    if all(colors[(i + j) % n] != colors[(i + j + 1) % n] for j in range(k - 1)):
        ans += 1
```

This is **O(nk)** and easily times out for `n = 10^5`.  
The sliding‑window trick is elegant because we don't need to re‑check the entire window; we just extend by one element and decide if the window is still alternating.

---

### H2 – Complexity Summary

| Approach | Time | Extra Space |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Naïve (check each window) | **O(nk)** | **O(1)** |
| Sliding Window (this solution) | **O(n)** | **O(1)** |

With `n` up to `10^5`, the O(n) algorithm is mandatory for LeetCode.

---

### H2 – Test Cases to Try

| Test | Input | Expected Output |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | `[0,1,0,1,0]`, `k=3` | `3` |
| 2 | `[0,1,0,0,1,0,1]`, `k=6` | `2` |
| 3 | `[1,1,0,1]`, `k=4` | `0` |
| 4 | `[0,1]` (invalid per constraints) | **ignored** |
| 5 | `[0,1,0,1]`, `k=4` | `1` |
| 6 | `[0,0,0,0]`, `k=3` | `0` |
| 7 | `[0,1,0,1,0,1]`, `k=3` | `6` (every rotation) |

---

### H2 – Interview Tips

- **Clarify circularity**: ask the interviewer to confirm if the array wraps.  
- **Explain `run` variable**: show how it maintains the length of the current alternating segment.  
- **Edge cases**: discuss `k == n` and `k > n` up front.  
- **Complexity**: highlight that the algorithm is linear and uses constant memory.  

---

### H2 – Conclusion

The Alternating Groups II problem is a classic example where a **sliding‑window** on a **circular array** turns a seemingly hard `O(nk)` task into a clean `O(n)` solution.  
Implementing it in Java, Python, or C++ is straightforward once you understand the “run” idea and how to handle wrap‑around with modulo arithmetic.

**Takeaway:** Keep an eye out for hidden circularity and think in terms of *runs* or *alternating segments*; you’ll often spot a one‑pass solution.
