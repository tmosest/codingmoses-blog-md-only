        ## 1. LeetCode 3210 – Find the Encrypted String  
**Problem ID:** 3210 | **Difficulty:** Easy | **Tags:** String, Math, Two Pointers

> You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.  
> Encrypt the string using the following algorithm:  
> For each character `c` in `s`, replace `c` with the *k*-th character **after** `c` in the string (cyclically).  
> Return the encrypted string.

**Examples**

| Input | Output | Explanation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `s = "dart"`, `k = 3` | `"tdar"` | Each character jumps 3 positions forward. |
| `s = "aaa"`, `k = 1` | `"aaa"` | All characters are identical, so the string stays the same. |

**Constraints**

| | |
|---|---|
| `1 <= s.length <= 100` | |
| `1 <= k <= 10^4` | |
| `s` consists only of lowercase English letters | |

---

## 2. Intuition & Observation

The encryption rule is *exactly* a circular shift of the string by `k` positions to the left.  
If `k` is larger than the length of the string (`n`), shifting by `n` brings every character back to its original place. Therefore, we only need to shift by

```
effectiveShift = k % n
```

The problem reduces to producing a new string where the character at index `i` in the original string moves to index `(i - effectiveShift) mod n`.  
Equivalently, we can build the result by picking the character that will end up at each new position:

```
for i in 0 .. n-1:
    result[i] = s[(i + effectiveShift) % n]
```

This yields an **O(n)** time and **O(n)** space solution.

---

## 3. Reference Implementations

Below are clean, idiomatic solutions in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.

> **Note:** All three versions handle the `k > n` case by computing `k % n` and produce the same output for the examples.

### 3.1 Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public String getEncryptedString(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        // Reduce the shift to the minimal needed amount
        k %= n;

        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            result.append(s.charAt((i + k) % n));
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

**Why this is good?**  
- `StringBuilder` avoids repeated string concatenation.  
- `k %= n` eliminates unnecessary loops when `k` is huge.  
- Readable loop with explicit indices.

---

### 3.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def getEncryptedString(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        k %= n                    # effective shift
        return ''.join(s[(i + k) % n] for i in range(n))
```

**Pythonic touchstones**

- List comprehension + `join` yields O(n) time.
- No explicit string builder; Python strings are immutable but `join` is efficient.

---

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string getEncryptedString(string s, int k) {
        int n = s.size();
        k %= n;                               // effective shift
        string res(n, '\0');                  // preallocate result
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            res[i] = s[(i + k) % n];
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

**C++ highlights**

- `string res(n, '\0')` preallocates memory, preventing repeated reallocations.
- Uses zero‑based indexing like all three languages.

---

## 4. Analysis

| | Time | Space |
|---|---|---|
| **All three solutions** | `O(n)` | `O(n)` |

- `n` is the length of `s` (≤ 100).  
- The algorithm is optimal; we cannot do better than reading every character once.

---

## 5. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Readability** | Loop with explicit index + comments; all code is self‑explanatory. | None. | Some naive solutions use nested loops or string concatenation (`+` in Java/Python), leading to O(n²) time. |
| **Performance** | `k %= n` keeps shifts minimal. | None. | Forgetting to reduce `k` may lead to huge unnecessary operations when `k` is 10⁴ and `n` is 1. |
| **Edge Cases** | Handles `k == n`, `k > n`, and identical characters gracefully. | None. | Mixing up `(i + k) % n` vs. `(i - k) % n` can reverse the encryption logic. |
| **Memory** | Preallocated result string/`StringBuilder`. | None. | Dynamic string concatenation inside a loop in Java/Python can allocate many intermediate strings, leading to memory bloat. |

### How to avoid the ugly pitfalls

- **Always reduce `k` modulo `n`** before proceeding.  
- **Avoid string concatenation in loops**—use a builder or preallocate.  
- **Keep index arithmetic simple**: `(i + shift) % n` is the most natural formulation for left‑rotation.  
- **Test boundary values**: `k == 1`, `k == n`, `k > n`, and `s` of length 1.

### Introduction

If you’re preparing for coding interviews, LeetCode’s *Easy* problems are a great place to polish your fundamentals. One such problem, **3210 – Find the Encrypted String**, tests your understanding of string manipulation and modular arithmetic. In this post, we’ll walk through the problem, derive an optimal solution, present clean code in three major languages, and discuss best practices that will make you shine in an interview.

---

### Problem Recap

> Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, replace every character with the `k`‑th character that comes after it in the string (circularly). Return the resulting encrypted string.

---

### Intuition

The operation is simply a **circular left rotation** by `k` positions. Because rotating by the string’s length brings the string back to its original state, we only need to rotate by `k % n`, where `n = s.length()`. This insight reduces the problem to an `O(n)` traversal.

---

### Why This Solution is Interview‑Friendly

1. **Time‑Space Optimality:** `O(n)` time and `O(n)` space, the best possible for a string problem.  
2. **Clear Logic:** A single loop with straightforward index arithmetic.  
3. **Language‑agnostic:** The algorithm maps directly to Java, Python, and C++.

---

### Reference Code

#### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public String getEncryptedString(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        k %= n;
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            result.append(s.charAt((i + k) % n));
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

#### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def getEncryptedString(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        k %= n
        return ''.join(s[(i + k) % n] for i in range(n))
```

#### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string getEncryptedString(string s, int k) {
        int n = s.size();
        k %= n;
        string res(n, '\0');
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            res[i] = s[(i + k) % n];
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

### Complexity Breakdown

- **Time:** `O(n)` – one pass over the string.  
- **Space:** `O(n)` – the output string.

---

### Edge Cases & Pitfalls

| Edge Case | Why it matters | How to handle |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| `k > n` | Shifting more than the string’s length unnecessarily increases runtime. | Reduce `k` by `k %= n`. |
| `k == 0` | No shift; should return the original string. | The algorithm naturally handles this after modulo. |
| `s` of length 1 | Only one character; shift does nothing. | `k %= 1` yields 0; loop produces the same character. |
| All identical characters | Result remains unchanged. | No special handling needed. |

---

### Good, Bad, Ugly – A Coding Perspective

- **Good**: Using a single loop with modular arithmetic; preallocating output memory.  
- **Bad**: Performing string concatenation inside a loop in Java/Python, which causes quadratic time.  
- **Ugly**: Forgetting to reduce `k` when it’s larger than the string length, leading to unnecessary computations.

---

### Interview Tips

1. **Clarify the Problem** – Ask whether `k` can be zero or negative (in this problem it can’t).  
2. **Explain the Modulo Trick** – Demonstrate understanding of cyclic behavior.  
3. **Discuss Complexity** – Show you can reason about time and space.  
4. **Show Code Cleanliness** – Keep it readable, comment when necessary.  
5. **Edge Cases** – Run through a few mentally; this often surprises interviewers.

---

### Takeaway

LeetCode 3210 is deceptively simple but encapsulates a classic interview pattern: recognize a rotation, reduce with modulo, and build a new string efficiently. Mastering this pattern not only solves the problem but also equips you with a tool for many other string and array problems you’ll encounter in real interviews.

Happy coding, and best of luck landing that dream job!
