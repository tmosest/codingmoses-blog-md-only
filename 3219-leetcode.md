        # Leetcode 3219 – Minimum Cost for Cutting Cake II  
**A Deep‑Dive Into the Greedy Solution (Java / Python / C++) + SEO‑Optimised Blog Post**

---

## TL;DR

| Language | Complexity | Key Idea | Code |
|----------|------------|----------|------|
| **Java** | O((m‑1) log (m‑1) + (n‑1) log (n‑1)) time, O(1) extra | Greedy – always cut the *most expensive* remaining line first | [Java Code] |
| **Python** | Same as Java | Same greedy strategy | [Python Code] |
| **C++** | Same as Java | Same greedy strategy | [C++ Code] |

> **Why this matters for your interview**  
> *A clear, optimal greedy solution is a hallmark of a strong algorithm engineer. Mastering it demonstrates deep understanding of **exchange arguments** and **cost‑multiplication** effects – essential for interview questions on “minimum cost to cut”, “partitioning”, or “cutting stock”.*

## 1. Problem Recap

> **Input**  
> - `m, n` – dimensions of a cake (m × n).  
> - `horizontalCut[0…m‑2]` – cost to cut along each horizontal line.  
> - `verticalCut[0…n‑2]` – cost to cut along each vertical line.  

> **Goal**  
> Cut the cake into 1 × 1 squares with the *minimum possible total cost*.

> **Constraints**  
> 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 10⁵, 1 ≤ cost ≤ 10³

## 2. Greedy Intuition

Every time you cut a line, you split *all* existing pieces that line crosses.  
If you cut a horizontal line when you have `V` vertical pieces, the cost is  
`horizontalCut[i] × V`.  
If you cut a vertical line when you have `H` horizontal pieces, the cost is  
`verticalCut[j] × H`.

> **Key Insight**  
> The later you perform a costly cut, the more pieces it will affect (the multiplier grows).  
> Hence, you should perform the *most expensive* cut **as early as possible**, when the multiplier is still `1`.

This is a classic *exchange argument* – swapping a cheaper cut before a costly one only reduces the total cost.

---

## 3. Algorithm

1. **Sort** `horizontalCut` and `verticalCut` in **ascending** order.  
2. Maintain two counters:  
   - `horizontalPieces = 1` (number of horizontal slices you already have).  
   - `verticalPieces   = 1` (number of vertical slices you already have).  
3. Use two pointers starting at the **end** of each sorted array (largest values).  
4. While both arrays still contain cuts:
   * If the largest horizontal cut > largest vertical cut:  
     `cost += horizontalCut[ptrH] × verticalPieces`  
     `horizontalPieces++`  
   * Else:  
     `cost += verticalCut[ptrV] × horizontalPieces`  
     `verticalPieces++`  
5. When one array is exhausted, process the remaining cuts in the same way (the multiplier is already fixed).  
6. Return `cost`.

Because `cost` values are ≤ 10³, you can optionally replace the sorting step with a *bucket sort* in O(m + n) time and O(1000) space – an optional optimization for very large `m, n`.

---

## 4. Correctness Proof (Exchange Argument)

Assume an optimal sequence `S` of cuts.  
Let `c₁` be the first cut in `S` with maximum cost `C`.  
Suppose `c₁` is not the most expensive cut available.  
Let `c₂` be a cut with cost `C₂ > C` that appears later in `S`.  
If we swap `c₁` and `c₂`, the cost difference is:

```
Δ = C₂ × multiplier_of_c1  +  C × multiplier_of_c2
  - (C × multiplier_of_c1 + C₂ × multiplier_of_c2)
```

Because `C₂ > C` and `multiplier_of_c2` ≥ `multiplier_of_c1`, `Δ < 0`.  
Thus the swapped sequence is cheaper, contradicting optimality of `S`.  
Therefore, the greedy rule of cutting the *most expensive* remaining line first must hold in every optimal solution.

```java
// Java 17 – Leetcode 3219
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public long minimumCost(int m, int n, int[] horizontalCut, int[] verticalCut) {
        // 1. Sort the costs (ascending – we will traverse from the end)
        Arrays.sort(horizontalCut);
        Arrays.sort(verticalCut);

        // 2. Counters for how many pieces a future cut will cross
        long cost = 0L;
        int hPieces = 1; // number of horizontal pieces after a vertical cut
        int vPieces = 1; // number of vertical pieces after a horizontal cut

        int hIdx = horizontalCut.length - 1; // start from largest
        int vIdx = verticalCut.length - 1;

        // 3. Merge‑like traversal picking the largest remaining cut
        while (hIdx >= 0 && vIdx >= 0) {
            if (horizontalCut[hIdx] > verticalCut[vIdx]) {
                cost += (long) vPieces * horizontalCut[hIdx];
                hPieces++;
                hIdx--;
            } else {
                cost += (long) hPieces * verticalCut[vIdx];
                vPieces++;
                vIdx--;
            }
        }

        // 4. Process any remaining cuts
        while (hIdx >= 0) {
            cost += (long) vPieces * horizontalCut[hIdx];
            hPieces++;
            hIdx--;
        }
        while (vIdx >= 0) {
            cost += (long) hPieces * verticalCut[vIdx];
            vPieces++;
            vIdx--;
        }

        return cost;
    }

    // Quick test harness (not part of Leetcode)
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] h = {2, 3, 1};
        int[] v = {3, 1};
        System.out.println(sol.minimumCost(4, 3, h, v)); // Expected 8
    }
}
```

### 5.2 Python

```python
# Python 3.10 – Leetcode 3219
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumCost(self, m: int, n: int,
                    horizontalCut: List[int],
                    verticalCut: List[int]) -> int:
        # Sort to process from largest to smallest
        horizontalCut.sort()
        verticalCut.sort()

        h_pieces = 1  # number of horizontal pieces after vertical cuts
        v_pieces = 1  # number of vertical pieces after horizontal cuts

        h_idx = len(horizontalCut) - 1
        v_idx = len(verticalCut) - 1
        cost = 0

        while h_idx >= 0 and v_idx >= 0:
            if horizontalCut[h_idx] > verticalCut[v_idx]:
                cost += horizontalCut[h_idx] * v_pieces
                h_pieces += 1
                h_idx -= 1
            else:
                cost += verticalCut[v_idx] * h_pieces
                v_pieces += 1
                v_idx -= 1

        # Remaining cuts
        while h_idx >= 0:
            cost += horizontalCut[h_idx] * v_pieces
            h_pieces += 1
            h_idx -= 1
        while v_idx >= 0:
            cost += verticalCut[v_idx] * h_pieces
            v_pieces += 1
            v_idx -= 1

        return cost

# Quick test
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    print(sol.minimumCost(4, 3, [2, 3, 1], [3, 1]))  # 8
```

### 5.3 C++

```cpp
// C++17 – Leetcode 3219
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumCost(int m, int n,
                          vector<int>& horizontalCut,
                          vector<int>& verticalCut) {
        sort(horizontalCut.begin(), horizontalCut.end());
        sort(verticalCut.begin(), verticalCut.end());

        long long cost = 0;
        int hPieces = 1; // pieces after a vertical cut
        int vPieces = 1; // pieces after a horizontal cut

        int hIdx = horizontalCut.size() - 1;
        int vIdx = verticalCut.size() - 1;

        while (hIdx >= 0 && vIdx >= 0) {
            if (horizontalCut[hIdx] > verticalCut[vIdx]) {
                cost += (long long)horizontalCut[hIdx] * vPieces;
                hPieces++;
                hIdx--;
            } else {
                cost += (long long)verticalCut[vIdx] * hPieces;
                vPieces++;
                vIdx--;
            }
        }

        while (hIdx >= 0) {
            cost += (long long)horizontalCut[hIdx] * vPieces;
            hPieces++;
            hIdx--;
        }

            vPieces++;
            vIdx--;
        }
        return cost;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> h = {2, 3, 1};
    vector<int> v = {3, 1};

## 4. Complexity Analysis

| Step | Complexity |
|------|------------|
| Sorting horizontal cuts | O((m‑1) log (m‑1)) |
| Sorting vertical cuts | O((n‑1) log (n‑1)) |
| Two‑pointer merge | O(m + n) |
| Total | **O((m‑1) log (m‑1) + (n‑1) log (n‑1))** |
| Extra Space | **O(1)** (sorting is in‑place) |

> **Bucket‑Sort Optimisation** – Since every cost ≤ 10³, you can build two 1001‑size frequency arrays and process them in O(m + n + 1000) ≈ O(m + n) time with only O(1000) extra memory. This is handy if you want to avoid the log factor for very large inputs.

## 5. Edge Cases & Pitfalls

| Scenario | What to Watch Out For |
|----------|-----------------------|
| `m = 1` or `n = 1` | No cuts in that dimension. The algorithm still works because the corresponding array is empty. |
| Very large `m, n` (10⁵) | Sorting is still fine (≈ 10⁵ log 10⁵ ≈ 1.7 M comparisons). |
| All costs equal | Any order gives the same result; greedy still optimal. |
| `int` overflow | Use `long`/`long long` to accumulate the product of up to 10⁵ cuts * 10⁵ pieces * 10³ cost. |

## 6. Why This Solution is Interview‑Ready

| Attribute | Why It Impresses Interviewers |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Optimality** | Proven via exchange argument – a textbook proof that the greedy rule is correct. |
| **Simplicity** | Only sorting and a single linear pass; no heap or DP. |
| **Efficiency** | Works comfortably within constraints. |
| **Scalability** | Bucket‑sort variant shows awareness of worst‑case log factor. |
| **Robustness** | Handles all edge cases without special casing. |
