        ## üöÄ LeetCode 3237 ‚Äì Alt and Tab Simulation  
> **Goal** ‚Äì Simulate the classic ‚ÄúAlt‚Äë+‚ÄëTab‚Äù window switcher and return the final order of windows.  
> **Languages** ‚Äì Java, Python, C++  
> **Interview‚ÄëReady** ‚Äì Time complexity O(n + q), Space complexity O(n)

### üìå Problem Recap

```text
Input
-------
windows : int[]  // initial stack ‚Äì first element is on top
queries : int[]  // each element is the window id to bring to top

Output
-------
final order of windows after all queries
```

> *If a query references the window that is already on top, nothing changes.*

Example  
```
windows = [1,2,3],  queries = [3,3,2]
Result   = [2,3,1]
```

---

### üîç Na√Øve Approach (Too Slow)

```
for each query:
    find window in array
    move it to front (O(n))
```

Complexity: **O(q ¬∑ n)** ‚Äì not acceptable for *n, q ‚â§ 10‚Åµ*.

---

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Efficient Strategy

1. **Process queries in reverse**  
   The *last* time a window appears in the queries list is the *first* time it should be placed at the top in the final stack.

2. **HashSet + List**  
   * Keep a set of windows that have already been moved to top.  
   * Build a list `topOrder` (in reverse) by iterating the queries from end to start and appending a window only if it hasn't appeared before.

3. **Append the remaining windows**  
   After the reversed processing, all windows not in the set are still in their original relative order.  
   Append them after `topOrder`.

4. **Return the concatenated result**  

> **Time**: O(n + q) ‚Äì each window and each query processed once.  
> **Space**: O(n) ‚Äì hash set + result array.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Code (Java, Python, C++)

> The following implementations follow the same logic.

### Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] simulationResult(int[] windows, int[] queries) {
        // Use LinkedHashSet to keep insertion order implicitly
        Set<Integer> moved = new LinkedHashSet<>();
        List<Integer> topOrder = new ArrayList<>();

        // Traverse queries in reverse to determine final top order
        for (int i = queries.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int win = queries[i];
            if (!moved.contains(win)) {
                moved.add(win);
                topOrder.add(win);          // will reverse later
            }
        }

        // Prepare result array
        int[] res = new int[windows.length];
        int idx = 0;

        // Add windows that were moved to top (reverse the order)
        for (int i = topOrder.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            res[idx++] = topOrder.get(i);
        }

        // Append windows that were never moved (keep original order)
        for (int win : windows) {
            if (!moved.contains(win)) {
                res[idx++] = win;
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

---

### Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def simulationResult(self, windows: List[int], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        moved = set()
        top_order = []

        # Reverse traversal of queries
        for win in reversed(queries):
            if win not in moved:
                moved.add(win)
                top_order.append(win)  # will reverse later

        # Build final result
        res = top_order[::-1] + [win for win in windows if win not in moved]
        return res
```

---

### C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> simulationResult(vector<int> windows, vector<int> queries) {
        unordered_set<int> moved;
        vector<int> topOrder;

        // Process queries from end to start
        for (int i = queries.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            int win = queries[i];
            if (moved.find(win) == moved.end()) {
                moved.insert(win);
                topOrder.push_back(win);          // will reverse later
            }
        }

        vector<int> res;
        // Add windows moved to top (reverse order)
        for (int i = topOrder.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i)
            res.push_back(topOrder[i]);

        // Append windows that were never moved
        for (int win : windows)
            if (moved.find(win) == moved.end())
                res.push_back(win);

        return res;
    }
};
```

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Why This Problem Matters in Interviews

* **Real‚ÄëWorld Analogy**: Managing windows is a common UI problem.  
* **Data‚ÄëStructure Flexibility**: The solution touches *sets, lists, and hash maps*.  
* **Scalability Test**: Constraints push you to think about *O(n)* solutions.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Good ‚Äì What Worked

| Feature | Why It‚Äôs Good |
|---------|---------------|
| **Reverse Query Processing** | Captures the *last* time a window is activated ‚Äì the key to the final top order. |
| **HashSet for O(1) Membership** | Avoids repeated scans, keeps algorithm linear. |
| **Single Pass Append** | After constructing the top list, we just walk the original windows once more. |
| **Language‚ÄëIndependent Logic** | Java, Python, C++ all share the same O(n+q) strategy. |

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Bad ‚Äì Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Consequence | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **For‚Äëloop from start to end** | You end up with a *top order that is the reverse* of the desired final state. | Iterate queries **backwards**. |
| **Using List.index() in Python** | Linear search on every query ‚Üí O(q¬∑n). | Use a set to remember seen windows. |
| **Ignoring Duplicate Queries** | You might reorder windows unnecessarily. | Skip windows already moved (checked via the set). |
| **Over‚Äëengineering** | Implementing a full linked‚Äëlist or a balanced BST for this simple problem. | Keep it simple: just two linear scans. |

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ The Ugly ‚Äì Edge Cases & Optimization Hints

| Edge Case | Why It Matters | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **All queries are the same** | Only one window changes position; rest stay as original. | Ensure the set logic skips subsequent duplicates. |
| **Queries cover all windows** | The final order is exactly the reverse of the query list. | Our algorithm handles this automatically. |
| **Large Input (10‚Åµ)** | Memory usage becomes critical. | Use primitive arrays (Java `int[]`) and avoid autoboxing. |
| **Multiple Test Cases** | LeetCode sometimes wraps calls in a loop. | Keep the solution stateless; just return the array. |

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Interview Tips

1. **Clarify the Problem** ‚Äì Ask if duplicate queries are allowed (they are).  
2. **Explain Complexity Early** ‚Äì Show you‚Äôre thinking about *O(n+q)*.  
3. **Show Your Approach in Pseudocode** ‚Äì E.g., ‚ÄúReverse iterate queries, use set, build top order, append rest.‚Äù  
4. **Edge‚ÄëCase Testing** ‚Äì Mention test cases like all duplicates, no duplicates, mixed queries.  
5. **Talk About Memory** ‚Äì In Java, avoid `ArrayList<Integer>` for 10‚Åµ items; use primitive `int[]`.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Takeaway

*LeetCode 3237* is a perfect blend of **array manipulation** and **set usage**.  
By **processing queries in reverse** and leveraging a **hash set**, you can transform an *O(q¬∑n)* brute force into a clean **O(n+q)** solution that works in Java, Python, and C++.
