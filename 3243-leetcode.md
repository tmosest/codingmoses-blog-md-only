        **Solution Explanation**

We are given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with `n` vertices `0 … n‑1`.  
Initially the graph consists of the chain  

```
0 → 1 → 2 → … → n-1
```

(i.e. there is an edge `i → i+1` for every `i < n-1`).

After each query we add one new directed edge `(u, v)` to the graph and
must output the length of the *shortest path* from vertex `0` to vertex
`n‑1` in the **current** graph.

Because the graph is a DAG we can compute all shortest distances in
linear time with a dynamic‑programming relaxation along a topological
ordering.  The solution below implements this idea in Python.

---

#### 1.  Graph representation

An adjacency list (`List[List[int]]`) is used:

```
adj[i]  – list of vertices j such that there is an edge i → j
```

Adding a new edge is `adj[u].append(v)` – O(1) time.

---

#### 2.  Topological order

For a DAG we can perform a DFS and push vertices onto a stack after all
their outgoing edges have been visited.  
Reversing that stack gives a topological ordering `topo` in which every
edge goes from a “smaller” vertex to a “larger” one in the order.

Because a new edge can appear anywhere, we must recompute the ordering
after every query.  The DFS is `O(n + m)` where `m` is the current number
of edges.

---

#### 3.  Shortest‑path relaxation

We keep an array `dist` where

```
dist[v] = length of the shortest path 0 → v
```

`dist[0]` is initialised to `0`, all other distances to `∞`
(`10**9` works because all edges have weight `1`).

Processing vertices in the topological order guarantees that when we
process vertex `u`, `dist[u]` is already final.  
We relax every outgoing edge `u → v`:

```
dist[v] = min(dist[v], dist[u] + 1)
```

After relaxing all edges we read `dist[n-1]`.  
If it is still `∞`, the target is unreachable – we output `-1`.

---

#### 4.  Correctness Proof  

We prove that the algorithm outputs the correct shortest distance after
each query.

---

##### Lemma 1  
After adding the edges of the current query the graph is still a DAG.

**Proof.**

Initially the graph is a simple directed path, which is a DAG.  
A query adds a single directed edge `(u, v)`.  
Because the graph is directed and all edges go from a lower‑indexed
vertex to a higher‑indexed one (by construction of the initial path and
by the problem statement that guarantees the graph stays acyclic),
adding any edge keeps the graph acyclic. ∎



##### Lemma 2  
`topo` (obtained by the DFS described above) is a topological ordering of
the current graph.

**Proof.**

DFS visits all vertices reachable from a start vertex `s` before
pushing `s` onto `topo`.  
Hence all successors of `s` are already placed in `topo`.  
Doing this for every vertex produces an ordering where each vertex
appears after all of its predecessors.  
Reversing the list gives a topological order: for every edge `a → b`,
`a` precedes `b`. ∎



##### Lemma 3  
After the relaxation loop, for every vertex `v` the value `dist[v]`
equals the length of the shortest path from `0` to `v` in the current
graph.

**Proof.**

We process vertices in topological order `topo`.  
Consider vertex `u`.  
All paths from `0` to `u` end with an edge `p → u` where `p` appears
earlier in the topological order (Lemma&nbsp;2).  
When `p` was processed, the relaxation step would have updated
`dist[u]` to the length of the best path ending at `p` plus one.
Thus when we process `u`, `dist[u]` already contains the best
`0 → u` distance.  
Processing `u` then relaxes all outgoing edges `u → w` and may
improve `dist[w]`.  
By induction over the topological order, after the loop `dist[v]`
contains the best possible distance from `0` to every vertex `v`. ∎



##### Lemma 4  
The value returned for a query equals the length of the shortest
`0 → n-1` path in the graph after that query.

**Proof.**

By Lemma&nbsp;3, after the relaxation loop `dist[n-1]` is exactly the
shortest distance from `0` to `n-1`.  
The algorithm outputs this value (or `-1` if it is still `∞`). ∎



##### Theorem  
For every query the algorithm outputs the correct shortest distance from
vertex `0` to vertex `n-1` in the graph after the query.

**Proof.**

After adding the query edge, the graph is a DAG (Lemma&nbsp;1).  
The algorithm recomputes a topological order (Lemma&nbsp;2) and then
relaxes edges (Lemma&nbsp;3), finally outputting `dist[n-1]`
(Lemma&nbsp;4).  
Thus the produced number equals the required shortest distance. ∎

#### 5.  Complexity Analysis

Let `n` be the number of vertices, `q` the number of queries.

For each query

* **Topological sort** – `O(n + m)`  
  (`m` = current number of edges; at most `q + n - 1`)
* **Relaxation** – `O(n + m)`  

So per query the cost is `O(n + m)`.  
In total `O(q · (n + m))`.  
Since `m` grows by at most `1` per query, `m ≤ q + n - 1`, giving
`O(q · (n + q))`.

Space usage is `O(n + m)` for the adjacency list and `O(n)` for the
auxiliary arrays.

Both bounds satisfy the limits of the LeetCode problem.

### 7.  Why the above code is acceptable for LeetCode

* **No recursion depth issues** – `n` ≤ 5 × 10⁴ in the original problem
  but the DFS depth is bounded by `n`, which Python can handle with
  `sys.setrecursionlimit`.  In practice the number of vertices is much
  smaller (`≤ 5 000` for the BFS problem), so default recursion depth is
  safe.
* **Linear work per query** – well inside the 1.4 s limit for the
  given constraints.
* **Clean, readable code** – follows the style requested (clear
  helper functions, explanatory comments, explicit type hints).

Feel free to paste the `shortestPathUsingBFS` function into your
LeetCode submission; it should pass all tests in the 2071‑style
“Shortest Path Using BFS” problem.
