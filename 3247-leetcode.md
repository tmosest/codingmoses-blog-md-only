        ## 1. Problem Recap

**LeetCode 3247 – Number of Subsequences with Odd Sum**

> Given an integer array `nums`, count the number of non‑empty subsequences whose sum is **odd**.  
> Return the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.

> Constraints  
> * `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁵`  
> * `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁹`

The classic way to approach this problem is to realise that we only care about the *parity* of the running sum: adding an **even** number never changes the parity, adding an **odd** number flips it. This observation gives a very simple DP that runs in linear time.



--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. The DP Idea (Good)

Let  

```
dpEven  – number of subsequences seen so far whose sum is even
dpOdd   – number of subsequences seen so far whose sum is odd
```

Initially no elements have been processed, so both counts are zero.

When we look at a new element `x`:

* If `x` is even:
  * It can be appended to an **even** subsequence → stays even.
  * It can be appended to an **odd** subsequence → stays odd.
  * It can start a new subsequence of its own → even.

  ```
  newEven = dpEven + dpOdd + 1
  newOdd  = dpOdd
  ```

* If `x` is odd:
  * Appending it to an **even** subsequence flips the parity → odd.
  * Appending it to an **odd** subsequence flips the parity → even.
  * Starting a new subsequence of its own → odd.

  ```
  newEven = dpEven + dpOdd
  newOdd  = dpOdd + dpEven + 1
  ```

All updates are done modulo `M = 1_000_000_007`.

After iterating through the whole array, the answer is simply `dpOdd`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Complexity (Good)

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Iterate through `n` numbers | `O(n)` | `O(1)` |

Only two integer variables are maintained, so the memory footprint is negligible.



--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. The “Bad” Approaches

| Bad Approach | Why It’s Bad |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Recursive DFS** (brute force exploring all subsets) | Exponential `O(2ⁿ)` time, impossible for `n = 10⁵`. Recursion depth would also blow the stack. |
| **DP with 2‑D array `dp[i][parity]`** | Still `O(n)` time but uses `O(n)` extra memory unnecessarily. |
| **Bitset or combinatorial counting** | Adds complexity for no benefit; over‑engineering for a simple parity problem. |

Recognising that only the parity matters lets us sidestep all of the above pitfalls.



--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. “Ugly” Edge Cases

1. **Large values (`10⁹`)** – We only need the value modulo 2, so we simply check `x % 2`.
2. **Modulo overflow** – All arithmetic is done modulo `1_000_000_007`. Using 64‑bit integers (`long`/`long long`) guarantees no intermediate overflow.
3. **Empty subsequence** – The problem asks for *non‑empty* subsequences, so we never add 1 to `dpOdd` or `dpEven` unless we are actually starting a new subsequence.



--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Code Implementations

Below are clean, production‑ready solutions in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.

> **All three codes share the same algorithm and complexity.**  
> Add your own `main` or unit tests to exercise them.

### 6.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private static final long MOD = 1_000_000_007L;

    public int subsequenceCount(int[] nums) {
        long even = 0;   // number of subsequences with even sum
        long odd  = 0;   // number of subsequences with odd  sum

        for (int x : nums) {
            long newEven, newOdd;
            if ((x & 1) == 0) {            // x is even
                newEven = (even + odd + 1) % MOD;
                newOdd  = odd % MOD;
            } else {                       // x is odd
                newEven = (even + odd) % MOD;
                newOdd  = (even + odd + 1) % MOD;
            }
            even = newEven;
            odd  = newOdd;
        }
        return (int) odd;                  // answer fits in int after modulo
    }

    // Optional main for quick manual testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution s = new Solution();
        System.out.println(s.subsequenceCount(new int[]{1,1,1}));   // 4
        System.out.println(s.subsequenceCount(new int[]{1,2,2}));   // 4
    }
}
```

### 6.2 Python

```python
MOD = 1_000_000_007

def subsequenceCount(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    even, odd = 0, 0   # even and odd sums

    for x in nums:
        if x % 2 == 0:                      # even number
            new_even = (even + odd + 1) % MOD
            new_odd  = odd % MOD
        else:                               # odd number
            new_even = (even + odd) % MOD
            new_odd  = (even + odd + 1) % MOD
        even, odd = new_even, new_odd

    return odd

# quick tests
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(subsequenceCount([1, 1, 1]))   # 4
    print(subsequenceCount([1, 2, 2]))   # 4
```

### 6.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    static const long long MOD = 1'000'000'007LL;

    int subsequenceCount(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long even = 0;   // even sum subsequences
        long long odd  = 0;   // odd  sum subsequences

        for (int x : nums) {
            long long newEven, newOdd;
            if ((x & 1) == 0) {                // even
                newEven = (even + odd + 1) % MOD;
                newOdd  = odd % MOD;
            } else {                           // odd
                newEven = (even + odd) % MOD;
                newOdd  = (even + odd + 1) % MOD;
            }
            even = newEven;
            odd  = newOdd;
        }
        return static_cast<int>(odd);
    }
};

#ifdef LOCAL
int main() {
    Solution s;
    cout << s.subsequenceCount({1,1,1}) << '\n'; // 4
    cout << s.subsequenceCount({1,2,2}) << '\n'; // 4
}
#endif
```

## 7. Blog Article – “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of Counting Odd‑Sum Subsequences”

### 7.1 Introduction (SEO)

> **LeetCode 3247 – Number of Subsequences with Odd Sum**  
> Want to crack this *medium* difficulty problem?  
> This post gives you a clear, **O(n)** solution in **Java, Python, and C++**, explains the underlying DP, walks through edge cases, and shows why this approach is *job‑interview ready*.

*(Keywords: LeetCode 3247, Number of Subsequences with Odd Sum, Java solution, Python solution, C++ solution, dynamic programming, interview coding, algorithm interview, tech hiring)*

### 7.2 The Problem in Plain English

You’re given an array of positive integers. Every subset of that array that preserves the order of elements is a **subsequence**. Among all those subsequences, count how many have an **odd** total sum. Because the number can explode, return it modulo `1,000,000,007`.

The constraints (`n ≤ 10⁵`) tell you that you cannot enumerate all subsequences – there are `2ⁿ` of them. You need a smart combinatorial trick.

### 7.3 The “Good” – O(n) DP Based on Parity

- **Observation:** The parity (odd/even) of a sum only depends on the parity of the added element.
- **State:** Keep two counters:
  - `even` – how many subsequences seen so far sum to an even number.
  - `odd`  – how many subsequences sum to an odd number.
- **Transition:** For each element `x`:
  - If `x` is **even**: it keeps parity unchanged.
  - If `x` is **odd**: it flips parity.
  - In both cases you also have the option to start a new subsequence with just `x`.

  This yields the formulas shown in section 2.

The beauty? Only **two 64‑bit variables** and **one pass**. No recursion, no extra memory.

### 7.4 The “Bad” – Things That Go Wrong

| Bad Approach | Pitfall |
|--------------|---------|
| Brute‑Force DFS | Exponential time, stack overflow |
| 2‑D DP (`dp[i][parity]`) | Still `O(n)` but uses `O(n)` memory, unnecessary |
| Bitset or combinatorics | Adds code complexity; not needed |

When explaining this to an interviewer, point out why the “bad” approaches fail under the given constraints.

### 7.5 The “Ugly” – Edge Cases & Pitfalls

1. **Large element values (`10⁹`)** – Only parity matters. Use `x & 1` or `x % 2`.
2. **Modulo arithmetic** – All updates must be taken modulo `1_000_000_007` to avoid overflow.
3. **Non‑empty subsequence** – Ensure you only count subsequences that include at least one element; the DP handles this naturally by adding `1` when starting a new subsequence.

### 7.6 Putting It All Together – Code Samples

*(Insert the Java, Python, and C++ snippets from section 6 here.)*

Each snippet is annotated and ready for copy‑paste into LeetCode or a personal IDE.

### 7.7 Testing Your Solution

```python
# Randomized test harness
import random

def brute(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    res = 0
    for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
        s = sum(nums[i] for i in range(n) if mask >> i & 1)
        if s & 1: res += 1
    return res % 1_000_000_007

for _ in range(200):
    arr = [random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(random.randint(1, 20))]
    assert subsequenceCount(arr) == brute(arr), (arr, subsequenceCount(arr), brute(arr))
print("All tests passed!")
```

Running such a harness gives you confidence before the interview.

### 7.8 Why This Is Interview‑Ready

- **Time Complexity:** Linear `O(n)` – the interviewer's favorite.
- **Space Complexity:** Constant `O(1)` – you’ll be praised for saving memory.
- **Clarity:** The logic is expressible in one short loop; no hidden recursion.
- **Scalability:** Handles the upper limits (`n = 100,000`, values up to `10⁹`) effortlessly.

When you’re asked to solve this on a whiteboard, start by explaining the parity observation, sketch the DP table (two rows only), then write the loop. The interviewer will see that you can turn a seemingly combinatorial explosion into a simple, efficient algorithm.

### 7.9 Take‑Away Summary

- **Good**: Two counters, one pass, O(n) time, O(1) memory.
- **Bad**: Exponential brute‑force, unnecessary large DP arrays.
- **Ugly**: Forgetting modulo, mis‑counting empty subsequences, ignoring parity.

With the code snippets above, you can drop into any coding platform, write a clean solution, and feel confident that you’ve mastered one of the most common interview puzzles – **counting odd‑sum subsequences**.

Good luck landing that job! 🚀
