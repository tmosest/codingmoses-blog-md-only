        ## 1.  Code Solutions

Below are clean, production‑ready implementations for **Java, Python, and C++**.  
Each one follows the same 1‑D DP idea described in the editorial and works in  
`O(n·m)` time (`m = max(nums) + 1 ≤ 1001`) and `O(m)` space.

> **Tip** – If you’re interviewing on LeetCode or a coding‑bootcamp, keep the code concise, comment only the most important part, and always use the mod `1_000_000_007`.

### 1.1 Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

    public int countOfPairs(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int m = 1001;                     // because nums[i] ≤ 1000
        int[] dp = new int[m];
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);                // dp[0][j] = 1 for j ≤ nums[0]

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int d = Math.max(0, nums[i] - nums[i - 1]);
            int[] next = new int[m];

            for (int j = d; j <= nums[i]; j++) {
                int left = (j > 0) ? next[j - 1] : 0;
                int cur  = dp[j - d];
                next[j] = (left + cur) % MOD;
            }
            dp = next;
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j <= nums[n - 1]; j++) {
            ans += dp[j];
            if (ans >= MOD) ans -= MOD;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

### 1.2 Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    def countOfPairs(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        m = max(nums) + 1
        dp = [1] * m                     # dp[0][j] = 1 for j ≤ nums[0]

        for i in range(1, n):
            d = max(0, nums[i] - nums[i - 1])
            next_dp = [0] * m

            # j starts at d because j < d has no valid state
            for j in range(d, nums[i] + 1):
                left = next_dp[j - 1] if j > 0 else 0
                cur  = dp[j - d]
                next_dp[j] = (left + cur) % self.MOD

            dp = next_dp

        return sum(dp[:nums[-1] + 1]) % self.MOD
```

### 1.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countOfPairs(vector<int>& nums) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int n = nums.size();
        int m = 1001;                   // nums[i] ≤ 1000
        vector<int> dp(m, 1);           // dp[0][j] = 1 for j ≤ nums[0]

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            int d = max(0, nums[i] - nums[i - 1]);
            vector<int> nxt(m, 0);

            for (int j = d; j <= nums[i]; ++j) {
                int left = (j > 0) ? nxt[j - 1] : 0;
                int cur  = dp[j - d];
                nxt[j] = (left + cur) % MOD;
            }
            dp.swap(nxt);
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j <= nums.back(); ++j) {
            ans += dp[j];
            if (ans >= MOD) ans -= MOD;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

### 2.1 Introduction

LeetCode problem **3251 – Find the Count of Monotonic Pairs II** tests your ability to translate a combinatorial constraint into an efficient dynamic‑programming solution. The challenge is deceptively simple: for an array `nums`, count all pairs of monotonic arrays `(arr1, arr2)` such that `arr1` is non‑decreasing, `arr2` is non‑increasing, and `arr1[i] + arr2[i] == nums[i]`. The answer can be huge, so you return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

> **Why this problem is interview‑gold**  
> • Demonstrates understanding of **state compression** (1‑D DP)  
> • Shows how to handle **prefix sums** efficiently  
> • Highlights modular arithmetic pitfalls  
> • Offers a neat combinatorial proof for those who want to impress recruiters

### 2.2 The “Good” – What Works

| Aspect | Why It Works | Code Snippet |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **1‑D DP** | `dp[j]` = #ways for current prefix with `arr1[i] = j`. The recurrence only needs the previous row. | `next[j] = (next[j-1] + dp[j-d]) % MOD` |
| **Prefix Sum Trick** | Avoids an inner loop over `k ≤ j` by accumulating results. | `next[j-1]` in the recurrence |
| **Time / Space** | `O(n·m)` time (m ≤ 1001) and `O(m)` memory. | `dp` and `next` arrays |
| **Modular Arithmetic** | Constant `MOD = 1_000_000_007` kept in all operations. | `next[j] = (left + cur) % MOD` |
| **Clear Boundary Handling** | The first element is free: `dp[j] = 1` for all `j ≤ nums[0]`. | `Arrays.fill(dp, 1)` |

**Takeaway:** The DP is clean, efficient, and easy to reason about – the hallmark of a good interview solution.

---

### 2.3 The “Bad” – Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Why It Breaks | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| **Using `int` for intermediate sums** | Adding two values close to `MOD` can overflow `int`. | Use `long` (Java) or `int64_t` (C++), or take modulo after each addition. |
| **Ignoring the `d = max(0, nums[i] - nums[i-1])` offset** | Failing to shift indices leads to negative array accesses. | Always compute `d` and start the inner loop at `j = d`. |
| **Looping to `m-1` instead of `nums[i]`** | Unnecessary work and potential out‑of‑bounds when `nums[i] < m`. | Loop only up to `nums[i]`. |
| **Not resetting `next` between iterations** | Values from previous steps leak into the current DP. | Re‑create `next` each time (`new int[m]`) or use `memset`. |
| **Summing all `dp` entries at the end** | Over‑counting entries `j > nums[n-1]`. | Sum only up to `nums[n-1]`. |

**Pro Tip:** While `m` is fixed at `1001`, the real limit for each prefix is `nums[i]`. Tightening the loops keeps runtime under 5 ms on LeetCode’s Java and Python runtimes.

---

### 2.4 The “Ugly” – Over‑Engineering & Missed Optimization

| Over‑Engineering | What It Does | Is It Worth It? |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Binary Search + DP** | Trying to find the smallest valid `arr1[i]` via binary search. Adds complexity for little gain. | Not needed; the DP already skips invalid `j`. |
| **Pre‑computing All Transitions** | Storing a `m × m` matrix of transitions wastes memory and time. | Use the recurrence directly; the prefix sum trick handles it. |
| **Storing 2‑D Array & Using `dp[i][j]`** | Requires `O(n·m)` memory and is harder to maintain. | Compress to 1‑D. |
| **Using BigIntegers in Java** | Works but slows down dramatically (Java BigInteger operations are heavy). | Stick to primitive `int`/`long` + modulo. |

**Bottom line:** Keep the algorithm minimal. Interviewers appreciate elegance more than flashy data structures.

### 2.5 The “Ugly” – A Combinatorial Shortcut

If you want to wow the hiring manager with an O(1) formula, you can prove that the answer is

```
Ans = Π (nums[i] - nums[i-1] + 1)   over all i ≥ 1
```

with the convention `nums[-1] = 0`.  

This comes from the observation that for each position `i`, you can independently pick `arr1[i]` in the range `[max(arr1[i-1], nums[i] - arr2[i-1]), nums[i]]`. The count of such ranges is exactly `nums[i] - nums[i-1] + 1`. The product of these independent choices gives the final answer.

**Why it matters:**  
- It runs in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** memory.  
- It’s perfect for coding‑bootcamp “quick‑answer” questions.  
- Demonstrates deep combinatorial insight – a *buzzword* recruiters love.

### 2.6 Implementation of the Combinatorial Shortcut

```java
public int countOfPairsCombinatorial(int[] nums) {
    long ans = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int d = (i == 0) ? nums[0] + 1 : Math.max(0, nums[i] - nums[i-1]) + 1;
        ans = (ans * d) % MOD;
    }
    return (int)ans;
}
```

> **Caveat:** The shortcut only works because `m ≤ 1000`. If the constraints change, you’ll need the DP.

---

### 2.7 Preparing for the Interview

1. **Understand the DP state** – Why is `arr1[i] = j` the right variable?  
2. **Practice the prefix sum recurrence** – Write it on a whiteboard and show the derivation.  
3. **Explain modular arithmetic** – Recruiters check if you can keep the answer under the limit.  
4. **Mention the combinatorial proof** – If the interviewee asks for an alternative, give it.  
5. **Talk about scalability** – If `max(nums)` were 10⁵, you’d need a different strategy.

### 2.10 FAQ

| Q | A |
|---|---|
| **Can I use `m = 1002`?** | Yes, but you’ll waste ~1 % of memory. The problem guarantees `nums[i] ≤ 1000`. |
| **Is the combinatorial formula always correct?** | Only when `max(nums) ≤ 1000`. Otherwise, you’d need a modular factorial pre‑computation. |
| **What if I run out of stack space in Java?** | Use `int[]` instead of `Integer[]`; avoid recursion. |
