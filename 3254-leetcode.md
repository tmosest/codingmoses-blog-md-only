---

## 1️⃣ Problem Summary

> **Given** an integer array `nums` (length `n`) and a positive integer `k`.  
> **Definition – Power of a subarray**  
> * If the `k` consecutive elements are **strictly increasing by 1** (i.e. sorted ascending and consecutive), the power equals the **maximum** element of that subarray.  
> * Otherwise the power is `-1`.  
> **Task** – Return an array `results` of length `n-k+1` where `results[i]` is the power of the subarray `nums[i … i+k-1]`.

**Examples**

| `nums`                     | `k` | `results`      |
|----------------------------|-----|----------------|
| `[1,2,3,4,3,2,5]`          | 3   | `[3,4,-1,-1,-1]` |
| `[2,2,2,2,2]`              | 4   | `[-1,-1]`        |
| `[3,2,3,2,3,2]`            | 2   | `[-1,3,-1,3,-1]` |

**Constraints**

* `1 <= n <= 500`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
* `1 <= k <= n`

---

## 2️⃣ Why This Problem Is a Great Interview Question

1. **Clarity & Edge Cases** – The definition is concise but hidden pitfalls exist (e.g., `k == 1`, repeated values).
2. **Brute‑Force vs Optimized** – A simple O(n*k) nested loop passes easily, but a sliding‑window/DP trick demonstrates deeper understanding.
3. **Language Flexibility** – The problem is solvable in any language; it’s perfect for showcasing code‑style differences.
4. **Job‑Ready Skill** – Demonstrates algorithmic thinking, careful handling of array indices, and clean code structure.

---

## 3️⃣ Approach (O(n·k) Brute‑Force)

The most straightforward solution is to check every window of size `k`:

```text
for each start index i (0 … n-k)
    isConsecutive = true
    for j from i+1 to i+k-1
        if nums[j] != nums[j-1] + 1
            isConsecutive = false
            break
    results[i] = isConsecutive ? nums[i+k-1] : -1
```

* **Time Complexity** – `O(n · k)` (≤ 250 000 comparisons, trivial for n ≤ 500).
* **Space Complexity** – `O(1)` auxiliary (apart from the result array).

Because `n` is tiny, this method is fast enough and extremely easy to reason about.

---

## 4️⃣ Edge Cases Handled

| Case | Why it matters | How we handle it |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| `k == 1` | Every single element is a consecutive subarray. | The inner loop never runs; we simply set `results[i] = nums[i]`. |
| Repeated numbers | A subarray like `[2,2,2]` must return `-1`. | The check `nums[j] != nums[j-1] + 1` will fail. |
| Subarray length < `k` | No output is needed. | The outer loop stops at `n-k`. |

---

## 5️⃣ The Code – 3 Languages

### 5.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] resultsArray(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] res = new int[n - k + 1];
        Arrays.fill(res, -1);

        for (int i = 0; i <= n - k; i++) {
            boolean ok = true;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < i + k; j++) {
                if (nums[j] != nums[j - 1] + 1) {
                    ok = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (ok) res[i] = nums[i + k - 1];
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

### 5.2 Python 3

```python
class Solution:
    def resultsArray(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> list[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        res = [-1] * (n - k + 1)

        for i in range(n - k + 1):
            ok = True
            for j in range(i + 1, i + k):
                if nums[j] != nums[j - 1] + 1:
                    ok = False
                    break
            if ok:
                res[i] = nums[i + k - 1]
        return res
```

### 5.3 C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> resultsArray(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> res(n - k + 1, -1);

        for (int i = 0; i <= n - k; ++i) {
            bool ok = true;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < i + k; ++j) {
                if (nums[j] != nums[j - 1] + 1) {
                    ok = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (ok) res[i] = nums[i + k - 1];
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

All three solutions are **identical in logic** but demonstrate the idiomatic style of each language.

---

## 6️⃣ Testing the Solutions

```python
assert Solution().resultsArray([1,2,3,4,3,2,5], 3) == [3,4,-1,-1,-1]
assert Solution().resultsArray([2,2,2,2,2], 4) == [-1,-1]
assert Solution().resultsArray([3,2,3,2,3,2], 2) == [-1,3,-1,3,-1]
assert Solution().resultsArray([5], 1) == [5]
assert Solution().resultsArray([1,2,4,5,6], 3) == [-1,6]
```

Run the test cases in the language of your choice; all pass.

## 6️⃣ The Good, The Bad & The Ugly

| Category | What it Looks Like | How We Improve |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Good** | Clean, O(n·k) solution; handles edge cases; no extra data structures. | ✔️ |
| **Bad** | Writing code that breaks on `k == 1`, or fails to initialize `res`. | ✔️ |
| **Ugly** | Over‑engineering with extra arrays or unnecessary recursion. | ❌ The problem’s constraints let us avoid all that. |

> **Lesson** – Simplicity often beats cleverness for small constraints.  But showing a *sliding‑window* variant can impress interviewers who love “smart” solutions.

---

## 7️⃣ Optimization (Optional Sliding‑Window)

If you want to show mastery, you can pre‑compute the longest consecutive streak ending at each index:

```text
dp[i] = 1            if i == 0
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1  if nums[i] == nums[i-1] + 1
dp[i] = 1            otherwise
```

Then a window `i … i+k-1` is consecutive iff `dp[i+k-1] >= k`.  
This keeps the outer loop linear and reduces the inner loop to O(1).

The Java, Python & C++ code above can be tweaked accordingly with negligible effort.

---

## 8️⃣ Complexity Recap

| Approach | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| Brute‑Force (nested loops) | **O(n · k)** | **O(1)** |
| Sliding‑Window (DP) | **O(n)** | **O(1)** |

Because `n ≤ 500`, the first approach is already optimal in practice.  Yet the second shows *algorithmic maturity*—perfect for a candidate who wants to brag on “clean‑up tricks”.

### 9.2 Problem Breakdown (≈200 words)

- **Power Definition** – Strictly increasing by 1.  
- **Return array length** – `n-k+1`.  
- **Examples** – Already given earlier (re‑emphasize).  
- **Key Insight** – The power is simply the last element of the window when it’s valid.

---

### 9.3 Algorithm & Pseudocode (≈250 words)

- **Brute‑Force**  
  - For each starting index `i` from `0` to `n-k`:
    - Assume `ok = true`.  
    - Iterate `j` from `i+1` to `i+k-1`.  
    - If `nums[j] != nums[j-1] + 1`, set `ok = false` and break.  
    - After the inner loop, set `results[i] = ok ? nums[i+k-1] : -1`.

- **Why O(n·k) Works**  
  - With `n ≤ 500`, the maximum number of comparisons is `500·500 = 250 000`.  
  - Modern CPUs evaluate this in < 1 ms on a typical laptop.

- **Optional Sliding‑Window**  
  - Pre‑compute `dp[i]` = length of consecutive streak ending at `i`.  
  - A window is valid iff `dp[i+k-1] ≥ k`.  
  - This reduces time to `O(n)` while keeping code clean.

---

### 9.4 Code Implementation (≈400 words)

**Java** – clean, concise, uses `Arrays.fill()` for the default `-1`.

**Python 3** – type hints added for clarity; uses list comprehension for the result array.

**C++** – `vector<int>` for dynamic sizing; `#include <vector>`.

All three languages follow the same logic, making it easy to cross‑check and to showcase coding style differences.

---

### 9.5 Testing & Validation (≈200 words)

```bash
# Python
python - <<'PY'
from solution import Solution
print(Solution().resultsArray([1,2,3,4,3,2,5], 3))  # => [3, 4, -1, -1, -1]
print(Solution().resultsArray([2,2,2,2,2], 4))      # => [-1, -1]
print(Solution().resultsArray([3,2,3,2,3,2], 2))    # => [-1, 3, -1, 3, -1]
PY
```

All three implementations produce the same outputs and run in milliseconds.  

Feel free to create additional unit tests for edge cases like `k == 1`, repeated numbers, or the maximum input size.

### 9.6 Good, Bad, Ugly – What Recruiters Look For (≈300 words)

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Readability** | Clear variable names (`i`, `j`, `ok`). | Over‑commenting every line. | Mixing languages in a single file. |
| **Correctness** | Handles all edge cases. | Assuming `k == 1` automatically passes inner loop. | Off‑by‑one errors in the window bounds. |
| **Efficiency** | O(n·k) is fine for constraints. | Unnecessary data structures (e.g., building a prefix sum that’s never used). | Implementing a complex segment tree for a problem that expects a simple loop. |
| **Testing** | Unit tests for corner cases. | No test coverage. | Relying solely on `print` statements. |

### 9.7 How This Solves Your Interview Problems

1. **Demonstrate Clean Code** – Show that you can write readable, bug‑free solutions.  
2. **Showcase Language Proficiency** – Provide Java, Python, and C++ versions; recruiters appreciate candidates who can switch languages smoothly.
