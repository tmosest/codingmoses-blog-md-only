        # 1.  The “Largest Palindrome Divisible by K” – Code, Analysis & an SEO‑friendly Blog Post

Below you’ll find a **full solution** written in **Java, Python and C++** that runs in *O(n · C)* time (C ≈ 100) and *O(n)* space, so it works comfortably for the maximal constraints  
\(1 \le n \le 10^5,\; 1 \le k \le 9\).

After the code you’ll read a blog‑style article that explains the “good, the bad and the ugly” of the problem, contains useful SEO keywords and even a short cheat‑sheet you can paste into a résumé or LinkedIn post.

## 2.  The Code

> **Note** – All three solutions use the *same* idea:  
> 1. Build the lexicographically largest palindrome of length *n* that starts with a digit `d` (and, for odd *n*, has a middle digit `m`).  
> 2. Check whether the number is divisible by `k`.  
> 3. Try the next smaller candidate until a valid one is found.

The search space is tiny (`d` ∈ [9…1] and `m` ∈ [9…0]) – at most 90 candidates – so the algorithm is easily fast enough even for *n = 100 000*.

> **Why not a pure DP / math‑based trick?**  
> For the interview, a *clear* brute‑force that is still optimal for the given constraints demonstrates both ingenuity and a solid grasp of constraints, which interviewers love.

### 2.1  Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public String largestPalindrome(int n, int k) {
        // Edge case: single digit
        if (n == 1) {
            for (int d = 9; d >= 1; d--) {
                if (d % k == 0) return String.valueOf(d);
            }
            return ""; // impossible but keeps compiler happy
        }

        // General case
        for (int d = 9; d >= 1; d--) {            // first / last digit
            if (n % 2 == 0) {                     // even length – no middle
                String s = buildPalindrome(n, d, -1);
                if (modK(s, k) == 0) return s;
            } else {                              // odd length – try middle digits
                for (int m = 9; m >= 0; m--) {
                    String s = buildPalindrome(n, d, m);
                    if (modK(s, k) == 0) return s;
                }
            }
        }
        return ""; // never reached – the problem guarantees a solution
    }

    /** builds string of length n, first & last = d, middle = m (or -1 if none) */
    private String buildPalindrome(int n, int d, int m) {
        char[] arr = new char[n];
        Arrays.fill(arr, '9');           // default largest digit
        arr[0] = arr[n - 1] = (char)('0' + d);
        if (m >= 0) arr[n / 2] = (char)('0' + m);
        return new String(arr);
    }

    /** fast remainder of a very large decimal string modulo k (k <= 9) */
    private int modK(String s, int k) {
        int rem = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            rem = (rem * 10 + (s.charAt(i) - '0')) % k;
        }
        return rem;
    }

                    if self._mod_k(s, k) == 0:
                        return s

    def _build(self, n, d, m):
        arr = ['9'] * n
        arr[0] = arr[-1] = str(d)
        if m is not None:
            arr[n // 2] = str(m)
        return ''.join(arr)

    def _mod_k(self, s, k):
        rem = 0
        for ch in s:
            rem = (rem * 10 + int(ch)) % k
        return rem

    string largestPalindrome(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1) {                       // single digit special case

### 3.1  Title (H1)

**Largest Palindrome Divisible by K – How to Win a LeetCode Interview in 3 Languages**

---

### 3.2  Introduction (H2)

> “LeetCode’s *Largest Palindrome Divisible by K* is a deceptively simple problem that hides a wealth of interview‑craft: it tests your ability to read constraints, use modular arithmetic, and produce a lexicographically maximal answer with **O(n)** time and space.”  

> If you’re preparing for a software‑engineering interview, mastering this problem will make you stand out to recruiters who value **constraint‑aware coding** and **clean problem‑solving**.

---

### 3.3  Problem Statement (H2)

> **Given**: an integer length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) and a divisor `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 9).  
> **Return**: the lexicographically largest *n*-digit palindrome that is divisible by `k`.  

> It is guaranteed that a solution always exists because we can always choose a suitable first digit and, for odd lengths, a middle digit.

---

### 3.4  The Good – Why the Brute‑Force Is Actually Optimal (H3)

1. **Tiny search space** – Only 9 possibilities for the first/last digit, plus 10 for the middle digit when *n* is odd → at most 90 candidates.
2. **Linear‑time divisibility check** – Since `k ≤ 9`, we can compute the remainder of a huge string in a single pass.  
3. **No need for big‑integer libraries** – We treat the number as a `String`/`char[]` and use modular arithmetic.
4. **Guaranteed optimal for the constraints** – `90 · n` operations (≈ 9 × 10⁶ for *n = 10⁵*) run in < 0.1 s on modern judges.
5. **Clear proof of correctness** – The outer loops are decreasing, so the first found string is indeed the largest.

> **Take‑away**: A well‑structured brute‑force that *exploits* the problem’s constraints is a hallmark of interview‑ready code.

### 3.5  The Bad – Edge Cases & Why We Must Be Careful (H3)

| Issue | Why it matters | How we addressed it |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| **n = 1** | No “first/last” trick – we must pick a single digit. | Explicit loop over 9…1 and check divisibility. |
| **Even vs. odd length** | The middle digit is only relevant for odd `n`. | Separate logic paths – `m` is set only when `n%2==1`. |
| **Large strings** | `String.valueOf(n)` would blow the memory or time. | Build the string incrementally with `char[]` / `list` – O(n) memory, linear construction. |
| **Divisibility check** | Converting to `int` or `long` fails for `n > 18`. | Compute remainder modulo `k` directly from the string (fast for `k ≤ 9`). |

> **Bottom line** – The “bad” part is that you can’t simply cast the palindrome into a numeric type; you have to work *digit by digit*. The good part is that, thanks to the tiny divisor set, this doesn’t hurt performance at all.

---

### 3.6  The Ugly – A Naïve Mistake to Avoid (H3)

> **Common pitfall**: Assuming “all 9’s” is always the answer.  
> This is **false for k = 5** (9 % 5 = 4) and for **k = 6, 7**.  
> If you code a solution that only returns a string of 9’s, you’ll get a Wrong Answer on the hidden test cases that check for divisibility.

> **Lesson** – Always double‑check the divisor after constructing your candidate; never shortcut the logic unless you can prove it mathematically for *all* `k` and `n`.

---

### 3.7  Code Snippets (for the Blog) (H3)

> ```java
> // Java – single‑line mod for k ≤ 9
> int rem = 0;
> for (char c : s.toCharArray())
>     rem = (rem * 10 + (c - '0')) % k;
> ```

> ```python
> # Python – equivalent inline remainder
> rem = 0
> for ch in s:
>     rem = (rem * 10 + int(ch)) % k
> ```

> ```cpp
> // C++ – same idea
> int rem = 0;
> for (char c : s)
>     rem = (rem * 10 + (c - '0')) % k;
> ```

## 4.  Blog Article – “The Good, The Bad & The Ugly of Largest Palindrome Divisible by K”

> **Why read this?**  
> Interviewers love stories that highlight a candidate’s *problem‑solving mindset*, *constraint awareness* and *clean coding style*.  
> This article is packed with the right keywords to rank on Google and LinkedIn, and it ends with a one‑liner you can copy‑paste into your résumé.

---

### 4.1  Introduction

> **“Largest Palindrome Divisible by K”** is one of the most frequent LeetCode interview problems for **software‑engineering** roles.  
> It blends basic math with string manipulation, making it a *perfect showcase* for candidates who are comfortable with **O(n)** algorithms and can think in **concrete terms**.

---

### 4.2  Why Palindromes Are Harder Than They Seem

- **Palindromic structure** forces symmetry: the first and last digit must match, so you cannot arbitrarily tweak the last digit to make the number even or divisible by 5.  
- **Large `n` (up to 100 000)** rules out *brute‑force* over all possible numbers – you must operate directly on the digits.  
- **Divisor `k` limited to 9** suggests a simple modulo check, but you still need to guarantee that *every* `k` works – the devil is in the details.

---

### 4.3  The Good – An Elegant Brute‑Force (Constraint‑Optimized)

1. **Tiny search space**:  
   *First/last digit* – 9 possibilities (1‑9).  
   *Middle digit* (odd `n`) – 10 possibilities (0‑9).  
   Total ≤ 90 candidates.

2. **Linear remainder check**:  
   For `k ≤ 9`, you can calculate `palindrome % k` in a single scan over the string.  
   No big‑integer libraries, no overflows.

3. **Guaranteed maximality**:  
   Because we iterate from 9 downwards, the *first* valid palindrome we find is automatically the **lexicographically largest**.

4. **O(n) construction**:  
   Build the string directly in a `char[]` (Java/C++) or `list` (Python).  
   No need to parse the whole number into a numeric type – you’re just *touching* each digit once.

> **Result** – A solution that is *both* efficient *and* readable. A recipe for interview success.

---

### 4.4  The Bad – What to Watch Out For

| Edge | What Can Go Wrong | How to Fix |
|------|------------------|------------|
| `n = 1` | No “first/last” trick – must choose a single digit. | Handle `n == 1` separately. |
| Even vs. Odd | Middle digit only matters for odd lengths. | Separate logic branches. |
| Large Numbers | Using `int` or `long` overflows. | Operate on digits, compute modulo directly. |
| Divisibility Misstep | Assuming “all 9’s” works for all `k`. | Always validate `pal % k == 0`. |

> **Take‑away** – A robust solution always checks the constraint *after* the construction step.

---

### 4.5  The Ugly – Common Mistakes

- **Over‑optimizing**: Returning a string of 9’s because you *think* it’s always maximal.  
- **Ignoring the middle digit** for odd `n`.  
- **Relying on 64‑bit integers** for `n > 18`, causing overflow.

> **Why these are “ugly”?**  
> They *look* efficient but fail the real test – the *divisor*.

---

### 4.6  A Clean Solution in 3 Languages

> - **Java**: `char[]` + linear `mod k` scan.  
> - **Python**: List of chars + same linear scan.  
> - **C++**: `std::string` + linear scan.

> Each implementation is under 70 lines, and each language demonstrates the *same core idea*: “Iterate over the fewest necessary digits, then validate divisibility”.

---

### 4.7  Interview‑Preparation Tips

1. **Read the constraints first** – `n` up to 100 000 means you must be linear.  
2. **Think in terms of digits** – Big integers → strings.  
3. **Pre‑compute the divisor** – For small `k`, a simple modulo loop is faster than a library call.  
4. **Test edge cases manually** – 1‑digit, even/odd, `k = 5`, `k = 6, 7`.

> **Pro‑tip**: After constructing your palindrome, immediately check `pal % k`. If it fails, iterate to the next candidate.

---

### 4.8  Why Recruiters Love This Problem
