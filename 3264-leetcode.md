        ## 1️⃣  Problem Recap (LeetCode 3264)

**Problem**  
Given an integer array `nums`, an integer `k` and an integer `multiplier`, repeat the following `k` times:

1. Find the **minimum** value `x` in `nums`.  
   *If there are several occurrences of the minimum, pick the left‑most one.*
2. Replace that occurrence of `x` with `x * multiplier`.

Return the final state of the array.

> **Constraints**  
> * `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 100`  
> * `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100`  
> * `1 ≤ k ≤ 10`  
> * `1 ≤ multiplier ≤ 5`

Because the limits are tiny, a straight‑forward *O(n · k)* brute‑force algorithm is sufficient and easy to understand.

---

## 2️⃣  Brute‑Force “Find‑Min‑and‑Replace” Solution

The algorithm follows the statement verbatim:

1. **Loop `k` times**  
   * Scan the whole array to locate the minimum value and its **first** index.  
   * Multiply that value by `multiplier` and write it back to the array.
2. Return the updated array.

Time Complexity: **O(n · k)** – `n` elements scanned in each of the `k` steps.  
Space Complexity: **O(1)** – we modify the input array in place.

Below are clean, production‑ready implementations in **Java**, **Python** and **C++**.

## 4️⃣  Why This Solution Is Perfect for Interviews

| ✅ | What interviewers care about |
|----|------------------------------|
| **Clarity** | The code follows the problem statement literally; easy to explain step‑by‑step. |
| **Complexity Awareness** | You can discuss *O(n · k)* and explain that with the given constraints it’s optimal enough. |
| **Space‑Efficiency** | In‑place modification uses only constant extra memory. |
| **Language Flexibility** | Same logic in Java, Python, and C++ demonstrates your ability to translate ideas across ecosystems. |

If you want to *improve* the algorithm for larger constraints, you can switch to a **min‑heap** (priority queue) to get *O(k log n)*, but for this problem the brute‑force version is both simpler and perfectly fine.

### 5.1  Introduction

If you’re hunting for a *medium‑level* LeetCode challenge that sharpens your array‑manipulation skills, **3264 – Final Array State After K Multiplication Operations** is a perfect fit. The task asks you to repeatedly multiply the smallest element in an array, picking the left‑most occurrence if duplicates exist. Although the statement is straightforward, it’s a great playground for practicing algorithmic thinking and coding cleanly across languages.

In this article we’ll:

1. Break down the problem and highlight the *“good”* parts (easy constraints, deterministic steps).  
2. Discuss the *“bad”* – potential pitfalls like off‑by‑one errors or misunderstanding the “first minimum” rule.  
3. Show how to avoid the *“ugly”* – overly complicated optimizations that clutter the code.  
4. Provide three polished solutions (Java, Python, C++).  
5. Share interview‑ready talking points and SEO‑friendly keywords that’ll boost your job‑search profile.

### 5.2  The Good – Why This Problem is a Friendly Start

- **Tiny Input Size**: `nums.length ≤ 100`, `k ≤ 10`.  
  A brute‑force *O(n · k)* algorithm will run in milliseconds.  
- **Deterministic Logic**: The operation is a simple “find‑min‑and‑multiply” loop.  
  No hidden state or recursion to manage.  
- **Clear Output**: The final array is the only result, so no need to keep history or produce complex structures.

---

### 5.3  The Bad – Common Traps

| Trap | Why It Happens | Fix |
|------|----------------|-----|
| **Picking the wrong minimum** | Forgetting to take the *first* occurrence when duplicates exist. | Scan left‑to‑right and stop at the first match. |
| **Off‑by‑one in loops** | Using `<` instead of `<=` when iterating over indices. | Test edge cases: single‑element arrays. |
| **Ignoring the multiplier** | Multiplying before or after finding the min incorrectly. | Multiply *after* updating the array. |
| **Unnecessary data structures** | Creating copies or extra lists for a simple in‑place update. | Operate directly on the input array. |

---

### 5.4  The Ugly – Over‑Engineering

When constraints grow (say `k` up to 10⁵), a *min‑heap* becomes desirable. However, for this problem:

- Building a heap adds **O(n)** overhead.  
- Popping and pushing `k` times costs **O(k log n)**, which is unnecessary overhead for the tiny input size.  
- Complex logic makes the code harder to read and maintain, turning a simple interview question into a maintenance nightmare.

Stick to the brute‑force solution unless the problem statement explicitly pushes for higher efficiency.

### 5.6  Interview‑Ready Talking Points

1. **Explain the algorithm**: “We simply scan for the minimum, multiply it, and repeat `k` times.”  
2. **Discuss time/space**: “O(n · k) time, O(1) space.”  
3. **Mention edge cases**: “Single element array, duplicate minima, large multiplier.”  
4. **Show confidence with the “first minimum” rule**: “Because we scan left‑to‑right, we automatically pick the left‑most minimum.”  
5. **Optional optimization**: “If `k` were huge, we could use a min‑heap for O(k log n) time, but it’s unnecessary here.”
