        ## 1. 3‑Language Solutions for **LeetCode 3271 – Hash Divided String**

Below you’ll find clean, production‑ready code in **Java, Python, and C++** that solves the problem in O(n) time and O(n/k) space.  
Feel free to copy‑paste into your IDE, unit‑test, and ship!  

| Language | File / Class Name | Main Function |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Java     | `Solution.java`   | `public String stringHash(String s, int k)` |
| Python   | `solution.py`     | `def stringHash(s: str, k: int) -> str` |
| C++      | `solution.cpp`    | `string stringHash(string s, int k)` |

---

### Java – `Solution.java`

```java
// 3271. Hash Divided String
// Java 17 (compatible with Java 8+)

class Solution {
    public String stringHash(String s, int k) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int n = s.length();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += k) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < i + k; ++j) {
                sum += s.charAt(j) - 'a';   // 0‑based alphabet index
            }
            int hashedChar = sum % 26;        // wrap around alphabet
            result.append((char) ('a' + hashedChar));
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

**Why this is good:**

* **Time‑linear** – each character is processed exactly once.
* **Readable** – nested loops mirror the “divide into k‑sized blocks” logic.
* **Safe** – no off‑by‑one errors; the inner loop uses the explicit boundary `i + k`.

---

### Python – `solution.py`

```python
# 3271. Hash Divided String
# Python 3.10+

def stringHash(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    result = []
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(0, n, k):
        block_sum = sum(ord(ch) - ord('a') for ch in s[i:i + k])
        hashed = block_sum % 26
        result.append(chr(ord('a') + hashed))
    return "".join(result)
```

**Why this is good:**

* Uses Python’s `range` step to jump by `k`, eliminating an inner counter.
* List‑appending and `join` keep memory usage linear and avoid string concatenation overhead.

---

### C++ – `solution.cpp`

```cpp
// 3271. Hash Divided String
// C++17 (G++17)

#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string stringHash(string s, int k) {
        string result;
        int n = s.size();
        result.reserve(n / k);          // pre‑allocate for speed

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += k) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < i + k; ++j)
                sum += s[j] - 'a';
            int hashed = sum % 26;
            result.push_back('a' + hashed);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

**Why this is good:**

* `reserve` prevents reallocations of the result string.
* Using raw loops keeps the code fast and easy to audit.

### Introduction

If you’ve ever stared at **LeetCode #3271 – “Hash Divided String”**, you know that string manipulation can be deceptively tricky. The problem asks you to:

1. Split a string `s` of length `n` into `n / k` blocks, each of length `k`.
2. For every block, sum the 0‑based alphabet positions of its characters.
3. Take that sum modulo 26 and map it back to a lowercase letter.
4. Concatenate those letters to form the final hash.

At first glance it looks like a simple sliding window, but subtle bugs (off‑by‑ones, integer overflow, and wrong alphabet offsets) bite many developers. Let’s walk through the **good** approaches, the **bad** pitfalls, and the **ugly** trade‑offs that often appear in real‑world code.

---

### The Good: Clean, Linear Solutions

| Language | Time | Space | Highlights |
|----------|------|-------|------------|
| Java | O(n) | O(n/k) | `StringBuilder` and explicit indices |
| Python | O(n) | O(n/k) | List comprehension + `join` |
| C++ | O(n) | O(n/k) | Pre‑allocated string and raw loops |

**Key takeaways:**

1. **Linear traversal** – no nested loops that multiply time by `k`.  
2. **Single pass per character** – each character is read exactly once.  
3. **Avoiding repeated modulus** – compute once after summing a block.  
4. **Memory efficiency** – pre‑allocate output or use `StringBuilder`.

These patterns make your solution robust against the worst constraints (`n = 1000`, `k = 1` → 1000 iterations).

### The Bad: Common Traps and Why They Fail

| Mistake | Why it’s bad | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Off‑by‑one in inner loop** | The inner loop sometimes runs `k + 1` times, leading to an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` in Java or `IndexError` in Python. | `for (int j = i; j <= i + k; ++j)` instead of `< i + k`. |
| **Using `% 97` to get alphabet index** | `97` is the ASCII code for `'a'`, but `% 97` is not equivalent to “subtract 97”. It produces wrong values for characters beyond `'a'`. | `'b' % 97` → 98 % 97 = 1, works by luck, but `'z' % 97` → 25, okay – still fragile. |
| **Not resetting the sum for each block** | A running sum across blocks corrupts the hash. | `int sum = 0; for (...) { sum += ...; }` – missing `sum = 0;` at block start. |
| **Using `+=` on strings in a loop** | In Java/Python, strings are immutable, so each `+=` creates a new string → O(n²). | `result += newChar;` inside a loop of length `n/k`. |
| **Ignoring `k` could be zero** | `k = 0` would divide by zero – although the problem guarantees `k >= 1`, defensive programming saves debugging time. | Add a guard: `if (k <= 0) return "";` |

### The Ugly: Performance Tweaks That Obscure Logic

Sometimes a coder will add micro‑optimisations that make the code unreadable:

* **Unrolled loops** – manually writing 5–10 iterations to cut a tiny fraction of runtime, at the cost of maintenance.  
* **Bit‑twiddling tricks** – e.g., using bitwise shift instead of `% 26` because `26` is not a power of two.  
* **Complex stream pipelines** in Java 8 – nested `map`, `reduce`, and `collect` that are elegant but hard to debug when a bug surfaces.

If the interview question is a warm‑up and you’re looking for a *clean* solution, skip the ugly. If you’re in a performance‑critical production environment, consider the trade‑off: does the micro‑optimization actually change real‑world throughput? Often it doesn’t.

### Why This Problem is a Gold‑Mine for Interviews

* **Demonstrates mastery of basic arithmetic & modulus.**  
* **Tests your ability to handle edge cases** (e.g., `k = n`).  
* **Highlights your choice of data structures** (`StringBuilder`, `list`, `std::string`).  
* **Shows your awareness of time‑space trade‑offs** – a perfect interview talking‑point.

Be ready to explain:

* “Why did I use a `StringBuilder`?”  
* “What happens if I forget to reset the sum?”  
* “How would you modify this if `k` were not a divisor of `n`?”
