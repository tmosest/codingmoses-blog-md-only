## TL;DR

| Language | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Java** | *O(n)* | *O(n/k)* |
| **Python** | *O(n)* | *O(n/k)* |
| **C++** | *O(n)* | *O(n/k)* |

> *n = |s| (always a multiple of k)*

## 1. Problem Recap (LeetCode 3271)

You are given a string `s` of lowercase letters and an integer `k` such that `k` divides `|s|`.  
1. Split `s` into `|s| / k` contiguous substrings, each of length `k`.  
2. For every substring, compute the sum of the alphabet positions of its characters (`a → 0, b → 1, …, z → 25`).  
3. Take that sum modulo 26 → `hashedChar`.  
4. Convert `hashedChar` back to a letter (`0 → a`, `25 → z`) and append it to the result string.

Return the final string of length `|s| / k`.

---

## 2. Solution Overview

- **Single Pass** – Iterate once over the characters, maintaining a rolling sum for the current block of size `k`.  
- **Modulo on the Fly** – After finishing a block, apply `% 26` and convert to a character.  
- **Constant‑time Operations** – All operations are `O(1)`, so the overall complexity is linear in the input size.

This is the most straightforward approach and runs in *O(n)* time, *O(1)* extra space besides the output.

## 3. Code

### 3.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public String stringHash(String s, int k) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int sum = 0;                 // running sum for current block

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            sum += s.charAt(i) - 'a';   // convert char to 0‑based index
            if ((i + 1) % k == 0) {     // end of block
                int hashed = sum % 26;
                sb.append((char) ('a' + hashed));
                sum = 0;                // reset for next block
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

    // Simple main for quick testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.stringHash("abcd", 2)); // bf
        System.out.println(sol.stringHash("mxz", 3));  // i
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def stringHash(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        res = []
        total = 0
        for i, ch in enumerate(s):
            total += ord(ch) - ord('a')
            if (i + 1) % k == 0:
                hashed = total % 26
                res.append(chr(ord('a') + hashed))
                total = 0
        return ''.join(res)

# quick test
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    print(sol.stringHash("abcd", 2))  # bf
    print(sol.stringHash("mxz", 3))   # i
```

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string stringHash(string s, int k) {
        string res;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); ++i) {
            sum += s[i] - 'a';
            if ((i + 1) % k == 0) {
                int hashed = sum % 26;
                res.push_back('a' + hashed);
                sum = 0;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    cout << sol.stringHash("abcd", 2) << endl; // bf
    cout << sol.stringHash("mxz", 3)  << endl; // i
    return 0;
}
```

## 4. Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Java | Python | C++ |
|--------|------|--------|-----|
| **Time** | *O(n)* – each character processed once | *O(n)* | *O(n)* |
| **Space** | *O(n/k)* – output string | *O(n/k)* | *O(n/k)* |
| **Auxiliary** | *O(1)* | *O(1)* | *O(1)* |

Because `n` is up to 1000, any linear solution easily passes the limits.

### 5.1 Introduction

When recruiters look at your LeetCode portfolio, they’re not only interested in the number of solved problems but also in how you explain them. **Hash Divided String (LeetCode #3271)** is a perfect case study to showcase your ability to:

1. Understand a problem quickly  
2. Come up with a clean, efficient algorithm  
3. Translate that algorithm into multiple languages  

Below is a “blog‑style” walkthrough that you can copy into your personal blog or LinkedIn article. It’s SEO‑friendly and includes the code snippets in Java, Python, and C++.

### 5.2 The Good – Why This Problem is a Winner

| Feature | Why It’s Helpful |
|---------|------------------|
| **Simplicity** | The logic is linear and easy to reason about, making it an excellent teaching tool. |
| **Language Agnostic** | Works in any major language – great for interviews where you might be asked to code in Java, Python, or C++. |
| **Real‑world Analogy** | The “hashing” step mirrors checksum or cryptographic hash concepts. |
| **Clear Output Size** | Result length is always `n/k`, so memory usage is predictable. |

**Takeaway**: It demonstrates that you can solve a problem with a single pass and constant‑space auxiliary data.

---

### 5.3 The Bad – Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | How to Avoid It |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Off‑by‑One Errors** | Remember that the block ends when `(index + 1) % k == 0`. |
| **Wrong Alphabet Index** | Use `char - 'a'` (or `ord(ch) - ord('a')`) instead of hard‑coding 97. |
| **Modding After Each Addition** | Modding inside the loop isn’t needed; only after the block is finished. |
| **Mutable vs Immutable Strings** | In Java, always use `StringBuilder`; in Python, build a list then `''.join`. |

**Pro Tip**: Write a quick unit test (`s="abcd",k=2 → "bf"`) before you submit.

---

### 5.4 The Ugly – Advanced Variations

> “The ugly” is where interviewers ask you to twist the problem.

1. **Variable Block Size** – `k` not guaranteed to divide `n`.  
   *Solution*: Process the last partial block separately or pad with `a`.  
2. **Non‑lowercase Alphabets** – Uppercase or digits.  
   *Solution*: Map via `string.ascii_lowercase` or a custom dictionary.  
3. **Multiple Test Cases in One Call** – Some interview platforms require you to process several inputs in a single run.  
   *Solution*: Wrap the logic in a helper function and loop over test cases.  

Showing that you can adapt the core idea to these scenarios signals flexibility and depth.

### 5.4 Implementation in Three Languages

> Insert the code blocks from section **3.** above here.  
> Add a short explanation for each snippet so readers know why you used `StringBuilder`, `list`, or `string` concatenation.

---

### 5.5 Interview Preparation Checklist

1. **Read the constraints** – 1000 chars, `k | n`.  
2. **Sketch** the algorithm on paper – a running sum and block delimiter.  
3. **Implement** in your “comfort language” first.  
4. **Translate** into the other required languages – this shows linguistic agility.  
5. **Explain** the complexity and why it’s optimal.  
6. **Answer “why” questions** – e.g., “Could we have used a dictionary for lookup?” (Answer: No, because alphabet indices are contiguous.)

### 5.6 How to Use This Article in a Job Application

1. **LinkedIn Pulse** – Tag recruiters, use the headline “Solved LeetCode 3271 – Hash Divided String”.
2. **Portfolio** – Add the code under a “Coding Challenges” section with the LeetCode link.  
3. **Interview Recap** – During the interview, say something like: “I solved #3271 with a single pass and presented the solution in Java, Python, and C++.”  
4. **Cover Letter** – Mention that you regularly tackle string‑hashing problems, which improves your problem‑solving toolkit.
