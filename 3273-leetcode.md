## 1. Problem Statement <a name="problem-statement"></a>

> **Minimum Amount of Damage Dealt to Bob**  
> *Difficulty: Medium*  

You are given:  
- `power` ‚Äì the number of health points Bob can remove per second with one attack.  
- Arrays `damage[i]` and `health[i]` (size **n**, `1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`).  

Each second Bob can attack **one** enemy and removes `power` health points from that enemy.  
After every second, every *alive* enemy deals damage equal to its `damage[i]` to Bob.  

**Goal**: Find the **minimum total damage** Bob can take if you play optimally.

**Return type**: `long` / `long long` / Python `int` (because the answer can be up to 10¬π¬≥).

## 2. Why This Problem Matters <a name="why-this-problem-matters"></a>

| ‚úÖ | üí° | üö´ |
|---|---|---|
| **Common interview question** ‚Äì LeetCode 3273 has become a popular ‚Äúinterview‚Äëprep‚Äù problem on platforms like **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, and **CodeSignal**. | **Greedy + sorting** ‚Äì The solution is a textbook application of **Smith‚Äôs Rule** for scheduling, an elegant bridge between algorithms and real‚Äëworld problems. | **Beware overflow** ‚Äì Even though constraints look small, the cumulative sum can reach 10¬π¬≥; a 32‚Äëbit integer will explode. |
| Helps you practice **comparators / custom sorting** (Java, C++), **functools.cmp_to_key** (Python), and **int arithmetic** (Python‚Äôs unbounded ints). | Gives you confidence in reasoning about **weighted completion time** ‚Äì a pattern that appears in many interview questions. | Interleaving attacks (e.g., switching enemies mid‚Äëattack) is *never* better ‚Äì many beginners try this and get stuck. |

## 3. Core Insight: Weighted Completion Time <a name="core-insight-weighted-completion-time"></a>

Let‚Äôs formalize the situation:

| Enemy `i` | Health `h·µ¢` | Damage per second `d·µ¢` | Attack time needed (seconds) `t·µ¢` |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `h·µ¢` / `power` (ceil) | `‚åàh·µ¢ / power‚åâ` | ‚Äì | ‚Äì |

**Observation**  
Bob can finish an enemy before moving to the next one without loss of optimality.  
If you delay finishing enemy `x`, its *completion time* `C‚Çì` grows, increasing the total damage `d‚Çì ¬∑ C‚Çì`.  
All enemies that come later will also be delayed, so it‚Äôs never beneficial to switch.

Thus the problem reduces to:  
> **Sequence the enemies in a single order.**  
> Each enemy `i` is attacked consecutively for `t·µ¢` seconds, then it dies.  
> The total damage is  

\[
\text{Total} = \sum_{i} d_i \times C_i
\]

where `C_i` is the completion time (when enemy `i` dies).

---

## 4. Greedy Solution (Smith‚Äôs Rule) <a name="greedy-solution-smiths-rule"></a>

The problem is exactly the **weighted completion time** scheduling problem on a single machine:

- **Processing time** = `t·µ¢` (seconds required to finish enemy `i`).  
- **Weight** = `d·µ¢` (damage per second).

Smith‚Äôs Rule (also known as *ratio rule*) states:

> *Order jobs by decreasing `weight / processing_time`.*

For our variables:

\[
\text{Ratio}_i = \frac{d_i}{t_i}
\]

If we sort enemies by this ratio **descending**, we obtain an optimal schedule.  
In case of ties any order is fine (the product comparison will be equal).

### Why the Rule Works  
- If job `A` has a higher ratio than job `B`, finishing `A` earlier saves more weighted time than finishing `B` first.  
- Swapping any adjacent pair that violates the ratio order strictly increases the objective.  
- Hence the sorted order is globally optimal.

## 5. Complexity Analysis <a name="complexity-analysis"></a>

| Step | Operation | Time | Space |
|------|-----------|------|-------|
| Compute `t·µ¢` (ceil division) | O(n) | O(n) (array of ints) |
| Sort indices by ratio | O(n log n) | O(n) (indices) |
| Accumulate answer | O(n) | O(1) additional |

**Overall**  
- **Time**: **O(n‚ÄØlog‚ÄØn)**  
- **Space**: **O(n)** (to store `t·µ¢` and an index array)

The numeric limits are tiny (`damage`, `health`, `power` ‚â§ 10‚Å¥) but the cumulative time `t` can reach `10‚Åπ`.  
Use 64‚Äëbit integers (`long long` / `long` / Python‚Äôs `int`) to avoid overflow.

## 6. Edge‚ÄëCase & Pitfalls <a name="edge-case--pitfalls"></a>

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Integer overflow in comparison** | Use 64‚Äëbit (`long long` / `long`) when computing `d[a] * t[b]` and `d[b] * t[a]`. |
| **Ceiling division** | `(h + power - 1) / power` is the standard trick. |
| **Sorting by ratio in Python** | Avoid floating‚Äëpoint comparison; use `functools.cmp_to_key`. |
| **Ties in ratio** | Any order works; if deterministic output is required, break ties by index. |
| **Large n** | Keep memory usage low; do not store more than O(n) integers. |

## 7. Code Snippets (Java / Python / C++) <a name="code-snippets"></a>

### Java (Java¬†17)

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public long minDamage(int power, int[] damage, int[] health) {
        int n = damage.length;
        int[] time = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            time[i] = (health[i] + power - 1) / power;   // ceil
        }

        Integer[] idx = new Integer[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) idx[i] = i;

        Arrays.sort(idx, (a, b) -> {
            long left  = (long) damage[a] * time[b];
            long right = (long) damage[b] * time[a];
            if (left == right) return 0;
            return left > right ? -1 : 1;   // descending order
        });

        long total = 0;
        long curTime = 0;
        for (int id : idx) {
            curTime += time[id];
            total += (long) damage[id] * curTime;
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

---

### Python (Python‚ÄØ3)

```python
from functools import cmp_to_key

def minDamage(power, damage, health):
    n = len(damage)
    times = [(h + power - 1) // power for h in health]   # ceil

    def cmp(a, b):
        left  = damage[a] * times[b]
        right = damage[b] * times[a]
        if left == right:
            return 0
        return -1 if left > right else 1   # descending ratio

    order = sorted(range(n), key=cmp_to_key(cmp))

    total, cur_time = 0, 0
    for i in order:
        cur_time += times[i]
        total += damage[i] * cur_time
    return total
```

---

### C++ (C++17)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long minDamage(int power, vector<int>& damage, vector<int>& health) {
        int n = damage.size();
        vector<int> t(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            t[i] = (health[i] + power - 1) / power;     // ceil

        vector<int> idx(n);
        iota(idx.begin(), idx.end(), 0);

        sort(idx.begin(), idx.end(), [&](int a, int b) {
            long long left  = 1LL * damage[a] * t[b];
            long long right = 1LL * damage[b] * t[a];
            return left > right;                       // descending ratio
        });

        long long ans = 0, cur = 0;
        for (int id : idx) {
            cur += t[id];
            ans += 1LL * damage[id] * cur;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## 8. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly <a name="the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly"></a>

### The Good  
- **Simplicity**: Once you recognize it‚Äôs a weighted scheduling problem, the solution is a single `O(n log n)` sort.  
- **Reusability**: Custom comparators appear in many interview problems.  
- **Deterministic**: The answer is guaranteed optimal; no back‚Äëtracking needed.

### The Bad  
- **Sorting cost**: For huge `n`, the `O(n log n)` step dominates, but there‚Äôs no way around it (unless you use bucket‚Äësort tricks, which are rarely expected).  
- **Potential confusion**: Beginners might think they can finish enemies faster by ‚Äúswitching‚Äù between them, leading to exponential complexity.

### The Ugly  
- **Over‚Äëoptimization attempts**:  
  *Switching enemies mid‚Äëattack* ‚Üí you end up writing a huge DP that never pays off.  
  *Using priority queues* ‚Üí over‚Äëcomplicates the solution.  

The key is to **lock down the order** once the ratio rule is applied and then just simulate the attacks.

## 9. Alternate Approaches & Variants <a name="alternate-approaches--variants"></a>

| Approach | When it‚Äôs useful |
|----------|-------------------|
| **DP on sorted order** | If constraints were small (n ‚â§ 20), you could brute force or use DP on permutations. |
| **Greedy with min‚Äëheap** | When enemies can have variable `power` or dynamic health; you‚Äôd need to re‚Äëevaluate the ratio after each attack. |
| **Bucket sorting** | If `damage / t` ratio is bounded by a small integer (e.g., ‚â§ 10), you could bucket‚Äësort in O(n). |
| **Parallel attacks** | Not applicable here; but if Bob could attack multiple enemies per second, the model changes to *multi‚Äëprocessor scheduling*. |

## 10. Take‚Äëaway for Interviews & Your Job Hunt <a name="take-away-for-interviews--your-job-hunt"></a>

1. **Identify the pattern** ‚Äì Weighted completion time appears in scheduling, job scheduling, and many ‚Äúminimum cost‚Äù problems.  
2. **Explain your reasoning** ‚Äì Talk through why finishing one enemy before another is always optimal.  
3. **Show the comparator** ‚Äì Write a custom comparison in Java/C++ or use `cmp_to_key` in Python.  
4. **Handle large numbers** ‚Äì Always ask clarifying questions about data types; demonstrate awareness of overflow.  
5. **Time & space complexity** ‚Äì Keep the discussion precise; interviewers love seeing you can quantify.  

When you solve this problem, you‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äì you‚Äôre showing the interviewer that you can:

- Recognize a classic algorithmic template.  
- Apply it with careful handling of constraints.  
- Deliver a clean, efficient solution in multiple languages.
