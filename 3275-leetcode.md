## Problem Restatement  

You are given an infinite 2‚ÄëD plane and a positive integer `k`.  
`queries` is a list of `n` unique points `[x, y]`.  
After each insertion you must report the Manhattan distance of the **k‚Äëth nearest obstacle** from the origin `(0,0)`.  
If there are fewer than `k` obstacles so far, return `-1`.

Manhattan distance = `|x| + |y|`.

> **Constraints**  
> * `1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 2¬∑10‚Åµ`  
> * `-10‚Åπ ‚â§ x, y ‚â§ 10‚Åπ`  
> * `1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`  

---

## Intuition  

The task is a classic ‚Äúmaintain the k‚Äësmallest (or k‚Äëlargest) values‚Äù problem.

* **If we keep a **max‚Äëheap** of size at most `k`**:  
  * The heap contains the current `k` smallest distances.  
  * The root (`top`) is the largest among them, i.e. the *k‚Äëth nearest* distance.  
  * When a new distance comes in:  
    * Push it onto the heap.  
    * If the heap size exceeds `k`, pop the root ‚Äì the farthest of the `k+1` distances.  
    * After this step, the heap again contains the `k` nearest distances.

* If the heap has fewer than `k` elements, we output `-1`.

This gives `O(log k)` per query, which is fast enough for `2¬∑10‚Åµ` queries.

## The Good  

| What | Why it‚Äôs great |
|------|----------------|
| **Simplicity** | A single `priority_queue`/`heapq` and a few lines of logic. |
| **Scalability** | `O(n log k)` is optimal for online queries. |
| **Memory‚Äëwise** | Only `k` distances are stored, no need to keep all obstacles. |

---

## The Bad  

| Issue | Remedy |
|-------|--------|
| **Large `k` (‚âà‚ÄØ10‚Åµ)** | Memory footprint is about 400‚ÄØKB (int) ‚Äì fine, but watch for 64‚Äëbit overhead in Python. |
| **Absolute value overflow** | `|x| + |y|` fits in 32‚Äëbit signed int (`‚â§‚ÄØ2¬∑10‚Åπ`), but using `long` guarantees safety in all languages. |
| **Input order** | Because queries are processed sequentially, you *must* handle ‚Äúless than k‚Äù cases immediately. |

---

## The Ugly  

1. **TLE on very tight systems** ‚Äì if you use a slow heap implementation (e.g. custom binary tree in Python), the log factor can dominate.  
2. **Mis‚Äëusing a min‚Äëheap** ‚Äì pushing distances into a min‚Äëheap and popping when the size exceeds `k` will give you the *k‚Äëth largest* distance, the wrong answer.  
3. **Neglecting negative coordinates** ‚Äì forgetting the `abs()` when computing distance leads to wrong results.

---

## Implementation

Below are clean, ready‚Äëto‚Äëpaste solutions for **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.

> All three use the same core idea: a max‚Äëheap of size `k`.

### Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] resultsArray(int[][] queries, int k) {
        int n = queries.length;
        // Max‚Äëheap: largest distance on top
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        int[] res = new int[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int dist = Math.abs(queries[i][0]) + Math.abs(queries[i][1]);

            pq.offer(dist);
            if (pq.size() > k) {
                pq.poll();               // remove farthest
            }

            res[i] = (pq.size() == k) ? pq.peek() : -1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def resultsArray(self, queries: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # Python heapq is a min‚Äëheap, so store negative distances
        max_heap: List[int] = []
        res: List[int] = []

        for x, y in queries:
            dist = abs(x) + abs(y)
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -dist)     # push negative
            if len(max_heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(max_heap)         # pop farthest (most negative)

            res.append(-max_heap[0] if len(max_heap) == k else -1)

        return res
```

### C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> resultsArray(vector<vector<int>>& queries, int k) {
        priority_queue<int> maxHeap;   // default is max‚Äëheap
        vector<int> res;
        for (auto &q : queries) {
            int dist = abs(q[0]) + abs(q[1]);
            maxHeap.push(dist);
            if (maxHeap.size() > k) maxHeap.pop();

            res.push_back(maxHeap.size() == k ? maxHeap.top() : -1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis  

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Push / pop per query | `O(log k)` | |
| Total for `n` queries | `O(n log k)` | `O(k)` |

With `n ‚â§ 2¬∑10‚Åµ` and `k ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`, this comfortably fits within typical LeetCode limits.

---

## Testing & Edge Cases  

| Test | Expected | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| `k = 1`, queries = `[[0,0]]` | `[0]` | First obstacle is the nearest. |
| `k = 3`, queries = `[[1,1], [2,2], [3,3]]` | `[-1,-1,6]` | Only after 3 obstacles we have a valid answer. |
| `k = 2`, queries = `[[5,5], [-5,-5]]` | `[10,10]` | Distances are equal; max‚Äëheap holds both. |
| Large coordinates `[-10‚Åπ, 10‚Åπ]` | Works without overflow. | `|x| + |y| ‚â§ 2¬∑10‚Åπ` < `INT_MAX`. |

---

## Interview Tips

1. **Explain the heap invariant** ‚Äì keep the top as the k‚Äëth nearest.
2. **Why a max‚Äëheap?** ‚Äì We need to discard the farthest when exceeding `k`. A min‚Äëheap would keep the farthest at the bottom.
3. **Edge handling** ‚Äì explicitly return `-1` when heap size < `k`.
4. **Complexity justification** ‚Äì show `O(log k)` per operation and total `O(n log k)`.

---

## Final Thoughts  

* **The good**: A clean, single‚Äëdata‚Äëstructure solution that scales.  
* **The bad**: Need to be mindful of input size and type limits.  
* **The ugly**: Forgetting the sign of the heap or mis‚Äëhandling the `k`‚Äëth threshold can silently break the solution.

This pattern shows up everywhere ‚Äì from ‚Äúk‚Äëth smallest number‚Äù problems to ‚Äútop‚Äëk frequency‚Äù tasks. Master it, and you‚Äôll be ready to tackle the next LeetCode challenge or interview question with confidence.

Happy coding, and best of luck landing that job! üöÄ
