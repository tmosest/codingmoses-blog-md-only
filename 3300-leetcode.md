## 1. Problem Statement

> **LeetCode 3300 ‚Äì Minimum Element After Replacement With Digit Sum**  
> **Difficulty**: Easy  
> **Tag**: Array, Math, Bit Manipulation

> Given an integer array `nums`, replace every element with the sum of its decimal digits.  
> Return the minimum value among the replaced elements.

### Examples

| Input | Output | Explanation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `[10, 12, 13, 14]` | `1` | Replaced: `[1, 3, 4, 5]` ‚Üí minimum `1` |
| `[1, 2, 3, 4]` | `1` | Already single‚Äëdigit |
| `[999, 19, 199]` | `10` | Replaced: `[27, 10, 19]` ‚Üí minimum `10` |

### Constraints

* `1 ‚â§ nums.length ‚â§ 100`
* `1 ‚â§ nums[i] ‚â§ 10‚Å¥`

---

## 2. Intuition & Approach

1. **Digit Sum Function**  
   For any integer `x`, repeatedly take `x % 10` (last digit) and add it to a running total, then divide `x` by 10 until it becomes zero.  
   *This is O(number of digits) ‚Äì at most 5 for the given constraints.*

2. **Single Pass**  
   Iterate over the array once.  
   * For each number, compute its digit sum.  
   * Keep track of the smallest digit sum seen so far.

3. **Return the Minimum**  
   After processing all elements, the stored minimum is the answer.

> **Why this works**  
> The operation is *independent* per element ‚Äì no inter‚Äëelement dependencies.  
> Therefore a linear scan suffices; no sorting or extra data structures are needed.

## 3. Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Time** | `O(n * d)` ‚Äì `n` numbers, `d` ‚â§ 5 digits | `O(n)` (since `d` is bounded by a constant) |
| **Space** | Only a few integer variables | `O(1)` |

> *With `n ‚â§ 100`, the algorithm is effectively instantaneous.*

## 4. Full Code

### Java

```java
// 3300. Minimum Element After Replacement With Digit Sum
class Solution {
    public int minElement(int[] nums) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int num : nums) {
            int sum = digitSum(num);
            if (sum < min) min = sum;
        }
        return min;
    }

    private int digitSum(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            sum += n % 10;
            n /= 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
# 3300. Minimum Element After Replacement With Digit Sum
class Solution:
    def minElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        def digit_sum(x: int) -> int:
            return sum(int(d) for d in str(x))

        return min(digit_sum(num) for num in nums)
```

> *Python‚Äôs string conversion is clean and works because `nums[i] ‚â§ 10‚Å¥`.*

### C++

```cpp
// 3300. Minimum Element After Replacement With Digit Sum
class Solution {
public:
    int minElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int minVal = INT_MAX;
        for (int num : nums) {
            int sum = digitSum(num);
            minVal = min(minVal, sum);
        }
        return minVal;
    }

private:
    int digitSum(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n) {
            sum += n % 10;
            n /= 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

> *Use `INT_MAX` from `<climits>` for the initial minimum.*

## 5. Good / Bad / Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Readability** | Simple loops, helper function `digitSum` | None | None |
| **Performance** | O(n) time, O(1) space | No need to sort or use heavy data structures | Unnecessary string conversion in Python (though still trivial) |
| **Edge Cases** | Handles `1`‚Äëdigit numbers, large numbers up to 10‚Å¥ | None | None |
| **Extensibility** | Easy to adapt for larger constraints | For extremely large numbers, digit sum might overflow int in Java/C++ ‚Äì use long | Not a concern with given limits |
| **Interview Impact** | Demonstrates clear thinking, proper complexity analysis | None | None |

> *Bottom line*: This solution is the textbook ‚Äúgood‚Äù approach for an easy LeetCode problem.

## 6. Turning This into a Job‚ÄëWinning Interview Story

1. **Highlight Clean Code**  
   Show that you can write production‚Äëready, maintainable code with helper functions and clear variable names.

2. **Show Complexity Awareness**  
   Interviewers love candidates who explain why an algorithm is efficient. Mention that the digit sum loop runs in constant time relative to the input size.

3. **Discuss Edge Cases**  
   Even for easy problems, ask about the maximum value and how your code would behave if it were larger. This shows depth.

4. **Mention Testing**  
   Talk about writing unit tests for typical cases (all single‚Äëdigit, all large numbers, a mix). Demonstrate confidence in correctness.

5. **Link to LeetCode**  
   When adding this problem to your portfolio, include a link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-element-after-replacement-with-digit-sum/  
   Employers love to see direct references.

6. **Broader Skill Set**  
   This problem touches *arrays*, *math*, *loops*, and *complexity*. Mention it as a stepping stone to more advanced topics like *dynamic programming* and *bit manipulation*.
