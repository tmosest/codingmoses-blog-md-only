        # 3302. Find the Lexicographically Smallest Valid Sequence  
**Java‚ÄØ/‚ÄØC++‚ÄØ/‚ÄØPython ‚Äì One Greedy Solution That Runs in O(n+m)**  

---

## üöÄ TL;DR

| Language | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Java** | O(n+m) | O(m) |
| **C++** | O(n+m) | O(m) |
| **Python** | O(n+m) | O(m) |

*`n = word1.length`, `m = word2.length` (m‚ÄØ<‚ÄØn ‚â§‚ÄØ3¬∑10‚Åµ)*  

The key idea:  
1. **Pre‚Äëcompute the rightmost index in `word1` that can match each suffix of `word2`.**  
2. **Scan `word1` from left to right, greedily picking indices that either match or are safe to skip the current `word2` character** (only allowed once).  
3. The first time we can skip a character, we must do it immediately ‚Äì that guarantees lexicographic minimality.

---

## üìÑ Problem Restatement

You are given two lowercase strings, `word1` and `word2`.

- A string `x` is **almost equal** to `y` if you can change **at most one** character of `x` so that it becomes identical to `y`.  
- A sequence of indices `seq` is **valid** if:
  1. `seq` is sorted ascendingly.
  2. Concatenating `word1[seq[i]]` in order gives a string that is almost equal to `word2`.

Return the *lexicographically smallest* valid sequence (array of indices).  
If no valid sequence exists, return an empty array.

> **Note**: ‚ÄúLexicographically smallest array‚Äù means we compare the sequences element‚Äëby‚Äëelement, not the resulting string.

---

## üìà Constraints

| Parameter | Range |
|-----------|-------|
| `1 ‚â§ word2.length < word1.length ‚â§ 3¬∑10‚Åµ` | |
| Characters | 'a' ‚Ä¶ 'z' |

---

## üéØ The Greedy Insight

Imagine we are scanning `word1` from left to right and want to build the sequence.

1. **If the current character equals `word2[j]`, we *must* take it** ‚Äì picking a later match would only shift indices right and never produce a smaller array.
2. **If it doesn‚Äôt match** we may *skip* the current `word2[j]` **once** (changing that character).  
   But we can only skip it if we can still finish the rest of `word2` using the suffix of `word1` that follows the current position.

So we need, for every position `i` in `word1`, the *earliest* position in `word2` that can be matched by the suffix `word1[i‚Ä¶]`.  
Pre‚Äëcomputing this is the trick that lets us decide in O(1) whether skipping is safe.

---

## üìä How the Algorithm Works

1. **Backward pass ‚Äì build `last[j]`**  
   `last[j]` stores the *rightmost* index in `word1` that can match `word2[j]`.  
   Scan `word1` from right to left; whenever we see `word1[i] == word2[j]`, set `last[j] = i` and move `j` left.

2. **Forward pass ‚Äì greedy build**  
   Walk `word1` again (left ‚Üí right).  
   Keep two variables:  
   * `j` ‚Äì current position in `word2`.  
   * `skip` ‚Äì whether we have already used the one allowed mismatch (0 or 1).  

   For each `i`:
   - **Case 1 ‚Äì Direct match**: `word1[i] == word2[j]` ‚Üí take `i`, `j++`.
   - **Case 2 ‚Äì Skip allowed** (`skip == 0`) and it is *safe* to skip `word2[j]`:
     *Safe* means that the next character of `word2` (`word2[j+1]`) can still be matched by a later index.  
     This is equivalent to `i < last[j+1]` (or if `j` is the last index, we are free to skip).  
     If the condition holds, take `i`, set `skip = 1`, `j++`.

3. **Termination**  
   If we managed to match all `m` characters (`j == m`), return the collected indices.  
   Otherwise, return an empty array.

---

## üìê Correctness Proof Sketch

1. **Feasibility** ‚Äì The algorithm only adds an index if it either matches the current `word2` character or it is a safe skip.  
   *Safe skip* guarantees that the rest of `word2` can still be matched, so the final string will be almost equal to `word2`.

2. **Lexicographic minimality** ‚Äì  
   * Any index chosen earlier than a later possible match will be smaller, so we never postpone a match that is possible.  
   * The only time we postpone is to skip a character.  
     We skip *only when it is safe* and *immediately* (the first time a skip is possible).  
     Skipping later would increase the first differing index in the resulting sequence, thus violating lexicographic minimality.

3. **Uniqueness of the sequence** ‚Äì  
   The greedy choices are forced: once a direct match exists we must take it; if we skip, the skip count becomes 1 and we can never skip again.  
   Therefore the algorithm produces a unique sequence that is lexicographically minimal among all valid sequences.

## üìö Complexity Analysis

| Phase | Time | Space |
|-------|------|-------|
| Backward pass | O(n) | O(m) (array `last`) |
| Forward pass | O(n) | O(m) (result array) |
| **Total** | **O(n + m)** | **O(m)** |

`n` can be up to 300‚ÄØ000, which is well within limits for modern CPUs.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Why it fails | How to avoid |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **Using the first match during forward scan** | It might be wrong if a later character can be skipped safely earlier. | Pre‚Äëcompute `last` and use it to check safety before skipping. |
| **Skipping whenever you see a mismatch** | Might leave no indices to finish `word2`. | Use the `last` array to guarantee that the suffix still contains a match for the remaining suffix of `word2`. |
| **Counting mismatches incorrectly** | Off‚Äëby‚Äëone errors when checking `last[j+1]` for the last character. | Treat the last index specially: you can skip it at any time because there is nothing after it to match. |
| **Using too much memory** | Storing a `last` array of size `n` would double memory. | Store only `last` of size `m` (suffix length), not an array of size `n`. |

                    j += 1

        return res if j == m else []
```

All three solutions use the *same* logic; the only differences are language‚Äëspecific syntactic details.

## üß© ‚ÄúGood, Bad, Ugly‚Äù ‚Äì What This Problem Teaches

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Difficulty** | 2‚Äëhour interview question | Requires careful O(n) reasoning | 300‚ÄØ000‚Äëchar inputs trip naive DP or recursion |
| **Key Insight** | A single skip is only possible if the rest of `word2` still fits | Forgetting to pre‚Äëcompute `last` leads to O(n¬≤) or TLE | Using a full DP array (`dp[i][j]`) blows memory (3¬∑10‚Åµ¬≤) |
| **Common Mistakes** | Taking the *first* matching index is wrong; you must postpone only for *safe* skips | Skipping arbitrarily gives wrong lexicographic result | Not handling the last character of `word2` (skip allowed only once) |
| **What Interviewers Love** | Linear time, O(m) memory, clear greedy reasoning | Explanation of safety check via `last[j+1]` | Demonstrating you can handle huge inputs without recursion |

## üéØ How This Helps Your Job Hunt

*Why is mastering this kind of greedy problem a ‚Äúcareer‚Äëboost‚Äù tactic?*

1. **Interview‚ÄëFriendly** ‚Äì Many tech interviews ask for *O(n)* solutions on linear‚Äëtime problems.  
   Demonstrating that you can think in terms of *two passes* and *pre‚Äëcomputed safety* shows you‚Äôre comfortable with optimal‚Äëtime algorithms.

2. **Scalability Mindset** ‚Äì  
   Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon emphasize handling data sizes in the millions.  
   Showing you can process 3¬∑10‚Åµ characters in under a second (‚âà‚ÄØ10‚ÄØms) signals that you‚Äôll write production‚Äëready code.

3. **Explain‚Äëand‚ÄëDemo** ‚Äì  
   When you walk through the solution during an interview, narrate the *greedy insight*, *safety check*, and *lexicographic guarantee*.  
   That demonstrates clarity of thought‚Äîa prized soft‚Äëskill in hiring panels.

## üåê TL;DR

- **Problem:** Find smallest‚Äëlexicographic index array, allowing at most one mismatch.
- **Solution:** Two linear passes, pre‚Äëcompute rightmost safe positions (`last`), and enforce safety check before a single skip.
- **Complexity:** `O(n)` time, `O(m)` memory.
- **Takeaway:** Mastering such greedy patterns boosts interview performance and demonstrates scalability thinking‚Äîessential for any top‚Äëtier tech role.
