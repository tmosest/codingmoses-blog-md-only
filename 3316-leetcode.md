        ## 1.  Problem Recap – LeetCode 3316  
**Find Maximum Removals From Source String**

> *Input*  
> • `source` – a string that contains the `pattern` as a subsequence.  
> • `pattern` – the string that must remain as a subsequence after we delete some characters.  
> • `targetIndices` – the *only* positions in `source` that we are allowed to delete.  

> *Goal* – delete the largest possible number of indices from `targetIndices` **while** `pattern` still appears in `source` as a subsequence.  
> The answer is the number of deletions we can perform, **not** the length of the
> resulting string.

---

## 2.  Core Idea – A 1‑D LCS‑style DP  

The problem is a slight variation of *Longest Common Subsequence* (LCS).  
While traversing `source` from right to left we keep a 1‑dimensional DP array:

| j | 0 … | `pattern.length` |
|---|-----|-------------------|
| `dp[j]` | maximum number of deletions that are still possible if the
           `j`‑th character of `pattern` is the first one we still have to match. |

### Transition

When we are looking at position `i` in `source`:

1. **Delete it (if allowed)**  
   `res = dp[j] + target[i]`  
   (`target[i]` is `1` if `i` is in `targetIndices`, otherwise `0`)

2. **Keep it as part of the subsequence** (only if it matches the current
   pattern character)  
   `res = max(res, dp[j+1])`  

After the inner loop finishes, `dp[j]` holds the best value for the prefix
`source[i … end]`.

We process `i` from `n‑1` down to `0`, so each state depends only on the
already‑updated values from the next position.

### Correctness Sketch

*Base case* – when `j == pattern.length`, the whole pattern has already
been matched.  We can delete *any* allowed character, so  
`dp[j] = dp[j] + target[i]`.

*Induction step* – for `j < pattern.length` we either delete the current
character (which is always legal if `target[i]` is true) or keep it **only
if** it matches the current pattern character.  
Because we only ever move forward in the pattern, every path that reaches
`j == pattern.length` guarantees that the entire pattern is present as a
subsequence.

Thus the DP array always stores the **maximum** deletions that keep the
pattern as a subsequence.  
The answer is simply `dp[0]` after the last iteration.

### Complexity

| Language | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| Java / Python / C++ | **O(n · m)** (`n = |source|`, `m = |pattern|`) | **O(m)** |
| All three solutions below use the same O(n·m) time / O(m) space
  optimisation. |

## 2.  Reference Implementations  

### 2.1  Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maxRemovals(String source, String pattern, int[] targetIndices) {
        int n = source.length();
        int m = pattern.length();

        // Boolean array – O(1) check if an index is in targetIndices
        boolean[] target = new boolean[n];
        for (int idx : targetIndices) target[idx] = true;

        int[] dp = new int[m + 1];
        // dp[m] == 0  (empty suffix of pattern can be matched with zero deletions)
        Arrays.fill(dp, Integer.MIN_VALUE / 2);   // protects against overflow
        dp[m] = 0;

        // Process source from right to left
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            char srcChar = source.charAt(i);
            boolean canDelete = target[i];

            // We iterate j from 0 .. m inclusive (so that j==m is legal)
            for (int j = 0; j <= m; j++) {
                int deleteOption = dp[j] + (canDelete ? 1 : 0);

                // Keep this character if it matches the pattern at position j
                int keepOption = Integer.MIN_VALUE / 2;
                if (j < m && srcChar == pattern.charAt(j)) {
                    keepOption = dp[j + 1];
                }

                dp[j] = Math.max(deleteOption, keepOption);
            }
        }
        return dp[0];
    }
}
```

### 2.2  Python 3 (fastest 1‑D DP)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxRemovals(self, source: str, pattern: str, targetIndices: list[int]) -> int:
        n, m = len(source), len(pattern)

        # Quick membership test
        target = [False] * n
        for idx in targetIndices:
            target[idx] = True

        dp = [float('-inf')] * (m + 1)
        dp[m] = 0            # empty pattern matched

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            src_char = source[i]
            for j in range(m + 1):
                # Option 1 – delete the character (if allowed)
                dp[j] += 1 if target[i] else 0

                # Option 2 – keep it and match the pattern
                if j < m and src_char == pattern[j]:
                    dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j + 1])

        return int(dp[0] > 0)  # dp[0] is the maximal deletions
```

### 2.3  C++ (modern, 1‑D DP)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxRemovals(string source, string pattern, vector<int> targetIndices) {
        int n = source.size(), m = pattern.size();

        // Mark all deletable positions
        vector<char> target(n, 0);
        for (int idx : targetIndices) target[idx] = 1;

        vector<int> dp(m + 1, INT_MIN / 2);
        dp[m] = 0;                    // base: empty pattern

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= m; ++j) {
                // Option 1: delete current character (if allowed)
                dp[j] += target[i];

                // Option 2: keep it if it matches pattern[j]
                if (j < m && source[i] == pattern[j]) {
                    dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j + 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0];
    }
};
```

All three codes run in **O(n × m)** time and **O(m)** memory – easily fast enough for the constraints (`n, m ≤ 1000`).

### 2.3  The Challenge – Why It Matters  <a name="challenge"></a>

> **Problem statement**:  
> You have a source string that already contains a pattern as a subsequence.  
> You can delete characters only at the indices listed in `targetIndices`.  
> How many deletions can you make **while still keeping the pattern as a subsequence**?

> **Why this problem is useful**:  
> * Interviewers love it because it tests two core concepts in a single bite:  
>   1. **Subsequence** – a classic DP problem.  
>   2. **Constrained deletion** – a twist that forces you to think about
>   *where* you can act.  
> * It forces you to consider *maximum* versus *minimum* – a frequent
>   interview theme.  
> * The constraints (`n, m ≤ 1000`) give ample room for a dynamic
>   programming (DP) solution.

---

### 2.4  Intuition – Subsequence Meets Deletion  <a name="intuition"></a>

> Think of the task as building a new string from left to right:
> *At every step* you decide: delete the current character (if you’re allowed),
> or keep it and possibly match it against the pattern.  
> If you can delete, you do it *unless it breaks the subsequence requirement*.  
> That is, you only have to be cautious when the character **must** be part of
> the pattern – deleting it would lose the pattern.

> The challenge is to evaluate *all possible paths* efficiently.  
> The natural first thought is the **2‑D DP** that keeps track of both
> the current position in `source` *and* how many pattern characters
> have been matched so far.  
> While correct, it wastes memory and makes the transition a bit more
> verbose.

> The insight that turns this into an elegant solution is to realise
> that the problem is a **LCS variant**:  
> “Delete as many as you can” → “Keep as many as you cannot delete”.  
> The 1‑D DP leverages the fact that once you have processed the suffix
> starting at position `i`, all later decisions are already fixed.

### 2.4  The 1‑D DP Solution  <a name="dp"></a>

#### 3.1 State Definition  
`dp[j]` – maximum deletions we can still perform if we are at the `j`‑th
character of the pattern (i.e. we still need to match `pattern[j]`).

#### 3.2 Transition Formula  
When we look at position `i` in `source`:

```
optionDelete = dp[j] + (target[i] ? 1 : 0)

if (j < m && source[i] == pattern[j])   // keep & match
    optionKeep = dp[j+1]
else
    optionKeep = -∞

dp[j] = max(optionDelete, optionKeep)
```

Because we scan `i` from right to left, `dp[j]` already holds the value for
`source[i+1 … end]`.  
`optionDelete` always exists; `optionKeep` only when the character matches.

#### 3.3 Edge Cases & Base Conditions  

| Condition | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| `j == m` – pattern finished | `dp[m] = dp[m] + (target[i] ? 1 : 0)`  
| `j < m` – pattern not finished | `dp[j]` is updated with both options. |

The base condition is `dp[m] = 0` because an empty pattern needs no
deletions.

---

### 2.5  Good, Bad, Ugly – A Programmer’s Lens  <a name="goodbadugly"></a>

#### 4.1  Good  
* **O(m) memory** – only a single array of length `m+1`.  
* **Clear loops** – easy to read, no recursive stack.  
* **Scalable** – works up to 1000 × 1000 comfortably.

#### 4.2  Bad  
A *naïve* 2‑D DP (states `[i][j]`) can also solve the problem, but:

* It uses `O(n·m)` memory – unnecessary for this problem.  
* Transition becomes slightly harder to implement due to
  boundary checks (`dp[n][m]` etc.).  

Most interviewers expect the space‑optimal version.

#### 4.3  Ugly  
Recursive top‑down DP with memoisation (`dfs(i, j)`) is elegant but has:

* **Large recursion depth** – up to 1000 → stack overflow in some
  languages.  
* **Hash‑based memo** – slower constant factors; you need a fast key (e.g.
  `(i, j)` pair packed into a 64‑bit integer).  
* **Careful initialisation** – you must avoid `INT_MIN` plus 1 leading to
  overflow.

If you choose recursion, wrap it in a helper that handles the overflow
safely.

### 2.6  Implementation in Three Languages  <a name="implementations"></a>

*(Show the code snippets from section 2.1 – 2.3 here. Each snippet should be
highlighted and commented for readability.)*

> *Tip*: In all languages, start by converting `targetIndices` into a
> boolean/char array for O(1) membership checks.

---

### 2.7  Testing & Complexity Analysis  <a name="testing"></a>

#### Test harness (Python)

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    assert sol.maxRemovals("abcde", "ace", [0, 2, 4]) == 2
    assert sol.maxRemovals("abcde", "ace", [1, 3])     == 0
    print("All tests passed")
```

> Use random generators for `source` and `pattern`, then brute‑force a
> subset of deletions (for small strings) to verify the DP.

#### Complexity recap

```
Time   :  O(|source| * |pattern|)   <= 1,000,000 operations
Space  :  O(|pattern|)             <= 1001 integers
```

---

### 2.8  Take‑away & Interview Tips  <a name="takeaway"></a>

* **Explain the state** – Interviewers love seeing a clear definition of
  `dp[j]`.  
* **Talk about boundary checks** – emphasize why `j == m` is a special case.  
* **Mention space optimisation** – ask if they prefer the 1‑D version, as it
  saves memory and is often a talking point in interviews.  
* **Time‑complexity** – quickly compute `n · m` for the given limits to
  reassure the interviewer that the solution is efficient.
