        ## 🛠️ Solution – “Find X‑Sum of All K‑Long Subarrays I”  
**LeetCode 3318** | **Easy** | `n ≤ 50`, `nums[i] ≤ 50`

---

### 📌 Problem Recap  
Given an integer array `nums`, window size `k`, and a value `x`, for every sub‑array of length `k` we must:

1. Count how many times each element appears.  
2. Keep only the *top x* most frequent elements.  
   * If two numbers have the same frequency, the larger value wins.  
3. Sum the kept elements (multiplying each number by its frequency).  
4. Return an array of these sums for every sliding window.

If a window has fewer than `x` distinct values, the result is simply the sum of the whole window.

---

## 1️⃣ Algorithm Overview  

1. **Sliding window** – move a window of size `k` through the array once.  
2. **Frequency map** – maintain a `Map<Integer, Integer>` for the current window.  
3. **Priority queue / heap** – create a max‑heap keyed by  
   * higher frequency → higher priority  
   * equal frequency → larger value → higher priority.  
4. **Pop top x** elements from the heap, add `value * frequency` to the answer.  
5. Repeat until the window reaches the end.

Because `n ≤ 50`, we rebuild the heap for every window – still fast enough  
(`O((n‑k+1) * k log k)` ≈  few microseconds) and far simpler to reason about.

---

## 2️⃣ Complexity  

| Measure | Time | Space |
|---------|------|-------|
| per window | `O(k log k)` (build heap) | `O(k)` (freq map + heap) |
| overall | `O((n-k+1) * k log k)` | `O(k)` (auxiliary) |

With the given constraints the algorithm is easily sub‑second in any language.

---

## 3️⃣ Edge Cases & Pitfalls  

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `x` equals the number of distinct values | The heap will simply contain all values – correct. |
| Window has fewer than `x` distinct numbers | Check `set.size() < x` → answer is the raw window sum. |
| Duplicate numbers with same frequency | Priority queue comparator handles tie by value. |
| Negative numbers (not in constraints) | Still works, but ensure comparator uses `>` and `<`. |

---

## 4️⃣ Reference Implementations  

Below you’ll find three complete, compilable solutions – **Java, Python, C++** – each following the same logic.

> ⚠️ **Tip:**  
> In interviews, discuss how you could keep the heap *incrementally* to achieve `O(n log k)` instead of `O((n‑k+1) * k log k)`.  
> With such a small input size, the simpler rebuild‑per‑window approach is usually preferred.

        for (int i = l; i < r; i++) {
            rawSum += nums[i];
            freq.merge(nums[i], 1, Integer::sum);
        }

        if (freq.size() <= x) {
            return rawSum; // all elements stay
        }

        // Max‑heap by frequency, then by value
        PriorityQueue<Map.Entry<Integer, Integer>> pq =
                new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> {
                    int cmp = Integer.compare(b.getValue(), a.getValue());
                    return cmp != 0 ? cmp : Integer.compare(b.getKey(), a.getKey());
                });

        pq.addAll(freq.entrySet());

### 1️⃣ Introduction  

At first glance, LeetCode 3318 *“Find X‑Sum of All K‑Long Subarrays I”* seems like a trivial sliding‑window puzzle.  
But in the interview room, the depth of the conversation matters far more than the speed of the code.

Why? Recruiters and hiring managers are not just looking for *correct* solutions – they’re hunting for:

* **Problem‑solving mindset** – ability to decompose a task and identify edge cases.  
* **Communication skills** – explaining the approach, trade‑offs, and pitfalls.  
* **Coding style** – clean, maintainable, and ready for production.  
* **Passion for learning** – curiosity about optimizing and improving the solution.

Below we unpack the *Good*, *Bad*, and *Ugly* aspects of this problem and how you can turn each into a hiring advantage.

---

### 2️⃣ The Good – What You Nail  

| What you’re doing | Why it matters |
|-------------------|----------------|
| **Clear problem restatement** | Shows you can capture requirements – the first step to any engineering job. |
| **Explain the sliding‑window idea** | Demonstrates algorithmic thinking and awareness of time/space trade‑offs. |
| **Show all three language versions** | Highlights cross‑platform fluency; recruiters love candidates who can move between tech stacks. |
| **Add a real‑world analogy** (e.g., “top‑x frequent items = most popular products in a store”) | Makes the logic memorable and showcases the ability to communicate complex ideas simply. |

> *Recruiter‑friendly note:* *“I can solve a problem in Java, Python, and C++ – I’m comfortable with multiple languages.”*

---

### 3️⃣ The Bad – Common Missteps  

| Misstep | What’s wrong | How to fix it |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **Hard‑coding thresholds** (e.g., always `x == 1`) | Misses the general case. | Parameterize the logic, explain why `x` can vary. |
| **Omitting edge‑case handling** (empty array, `k==0`) | Leads to runtime errors. | Validate inputs and handle corner cases explicitly. |
| **Using only a hash map** | Misses the *frequency‑then‑value* ordering requirement. | Use a comparator that accounts for ties. |
| **Rebuilding the heap every iteration** | Though still fast for `n ≤ 50`, the interviewer may expect an incremental approach. | Mention an `O(n log k)` improvement as a bonus. |

> **Pro‑tip:** In a real interview, say *“I’d keep the heap up‑to‑date with each window shift, which brings us to O(n log k)”* and sketch the idea on a whiteboard.

---

### 4️⃣ The Ugly – What to Avoid (and How to Recover)  

| Ugly scenario | Why it hurts | Quick recovery |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Spaghetti code** (mixing counters, heaps, and loops without clear functions) | Recruiters quickly spot lack of structure. | Refactor into small helper functions. |
| **Missing comments** | Makes your code look cryptic, especially for a recruiter who might skim. | Add brief inline explanations. |
| **Non‑idiomatic language usage** (e.g., using `map` instead of `unordered_map` in C++ for small inputs) | Signals not being up‑to‑date with best practices. | Use the most common STL containers for the language. |
| **Hard‑coding magic numbers** (`-1`, `-5`) | Prevents re‑use in other contexts. | Use named constants or explain the logic. |

---

### 5️⃣ Bonus: How to Turn the Discussion Into a STAR Interview Question  

> **Situation:** “I was presented with a sliding‑window problem where we had to keep the most frequent elements.”
> **Task:** “I needed to produce a clean, production‑ready solution in multiple languages.”
> **Action:** “I implemented a frequency map, rebuilt a max‑heap for each window, and handled ties by value. I also sketched how to keep the heap incremental for O(n log k) performance.”
> **Result:** “The solution runs in < 5 ms in Java, < 1 ms in Python, and < 2 ms in C++. I demonstrated cross‑platform fluency and algorithmic thinking, which got me a call from a top‑tier tech company.”
