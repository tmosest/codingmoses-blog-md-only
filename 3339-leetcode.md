        ## 1.  Solution Overview

For every pair of adjacent elements  
`(arr[i] , arr[i+1])` we compute  

```
(arr[i] * arr[i+1]) – arr[i] – arr[i+1]
```

The value is **even** iff the two numbers have the **same parity**  
(either both even or both odd).  
So a *k‑even* array is an array of length `n` that contains exactly `k` adjacent
pairs of the same parity.

The problem reduces to counting how many ways we can build an array of
length `n` where the number of adjacent equal‑parity pairs is exactly `k`.

---

### 1.1  DP state

```
dp[pos][cnt][prev]   (0 ≤ pos ≤ n, 0 ≤ cnt ≤ k, prev ∈ {0,1})
```

* `pos` – how many elements have already been chosen (`0 … n`)
* `cnt` – how many “good” pairs we have built so far
* `prev` – parity of the element placed at position `pos‑1`  
  (`0 = odd`, `1 = even`)

Transition for the next element:

* If we place an **even** number  
  *newCnt = cnt + (prev == 1 ? 1 : 0)*  
  There are `m/2` even numbers available.
* If we place an **odd** number  
  *newCnt = cnt* (because the pair can’t be “good” if one side is odd)  
  There are `(m+1)/2` odd numbers available.

The answer is `dp[n][k][0] + dp[n][k][1] (mod MOD)`.

The DP runs in **O(n · k)** time and **O(n · k · 2)** memory,
well within the limits (`n ≤ 750`, `k ≤ n‑1`).

## 2.  Reference Implementations

### 2.1  Java (top‑down memoization)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private static final long MOD = 1_000_000_007L;
    private long[][][] memo;
    private int m;

    public int countOfArrays(int n, int m, int k) {
        this.m = m;
        memo = new long[n][k + 1][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++)
                Arrays.fill(memo[i][j], -1L);
        return (int) dfs(0, 0, 0, k);
    }

    private long dfs(int pos, int cnt, int prev, int k) {
        if (pos == 0) {                     // no previous element
            return cnt == k ? 1 : 0;        // should never happen
        }
        if (pos == 0) return 0;             // safety
        if (cnt > k) return 0;              // pruning
        if (pos == 0) return 0;             // dummy guard

        if (memo[pos - 1][cnt][prev] != -1L)
            return memo[pos - 1][cnt][prev];

        long res = 0;
        // place an even number
        int newCnt = cnt + (prev == 1 ? 1 : 0);
        res += ((m / 2L) * dfs(pos + 1, newCnt, 1, k)) % MOD;

        // place an odd number
        res += (((m + 1L) / 2L) * dfs(pos + 1, cnt, 0, k)) % MOD;

        memo[pos - 1][cnt][prev] = res % MOD;
        return memo[pos - 1][cnt][prev];
    }
}
```

> **Why memoization?**  
> The state space is small, but recursive calls explode without caching.  
> Storing results turns the exponential recursion into linear DP.

### 2.2  Python (iterative DP)

```python
MOD = 1_000_000_007

def countOfArrays(n: int, m: int, k: int) -> int:
    evens = m // 2
    odds  = (m + 1) // 2

    # dp[pos][cnt][prev]  prev: 0 odd, 1 even
    dp = [[[0, 0] for _ in range(k + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    # first element – no pair yet
    dp[1][0][0] = odds
    dp[1][0][1] = evens

    for pos in range(2, n + 1):
        for cnt in range(k + 1):
            # previous odd
            if dp[pos - 1][cnt][0]:
                dp[pos][cnt][0] = (dp[pos][cnt][0] +
                                   dp[pos - 1][cnt][0] * odds) % MOD
                if cnt + 1 <= k:
                    dp[pos][cnt + 1][1] = (dp[pos][cnt + 1][1] +
                                           dp[pos - 1][cnt][0] * evens) % MOD
            # previous even
            if dp[pos - 1][cnt][1]:
                dp[pos][cnt][0] = (dp[pos][cnt][0] +
                                   dp[pos - 1][cnt][1] * odds) % MOD
                if cnt + 1 <= k:
                    dp[pos][cnt + 1][1] = (dp[pos][cnt + 1][1] +
                                           dp[pos - 1][cnt][1] * evens) % MOD

    return (dp[n][k][0] + dp[n][k][1]) % MOD
```

> **Tip:**  
> Initialising the first element separately avoids the special case `prev = -1`.

### 2.3  C++ (bottom‑up DP)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countOfArrays(int n, int m, int k) {
        const long long MOD = 1'000'000'007LL;
        long long evens = m / 2;
        long long odds  = (m + 1) / 2;

        // dp[pos][cnt][prev]  prev: 0 odd, 1 even
        vector<vector<array<long long,2>>> dp(n + 1,
            vector<array<long long,2>>(k + 1, {0,0}));

        // first element
        dp[1][0][0] = odds;
        dp[1][0][1] = evens;

        for (int pos = 2; pos <= n; ++pos) {
            for (int cnt = 0; cnt <= k; ++cnt) {
                // prev odd
                if (dp[pos-1][cnt][0]) {
                    dp[pos][cnt][0] = (dp[pos][cnt][0] +
                        dp[pos-1][cnt][0] * odds) % MOD;
                    if (cnt+1 <= k)
                        dp[pos][cnt+1][1] = (dp[pos][cnt+1][1] +
                            dp[pos-1][cnt][0] * evens) % MOD;
                }
                // prev even
                if (dp[pos-1][cnt][1]) {
                    dp[pos][cnt][0] = (dp[pos][cnt][0] +
                        dp[pos-1][cnt][1] * odds) % MOD;
                    if (cnt+1 <= k)
                        dp[pos][cnt+1][1] = (dp[pos][cnt+1][1] +
                            dp[pos-1][cnt][1] * evens) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        return (dp[n][k][0] + dp[n][k][1]) % MOD;
    }
};
```

### 3.2  Introduction

> “You are given three integers *n*, *m*, *k*.  
> Count how many arrays of size *n* with elements in [1, *m*] have exactly *k* adjacent pairs whose product minus the sum is even.”  

It looks intimidating, but once you recognize the parity trick, the solution is
a textbook DP problem.  
In this article I’ll walk through:

1. **The good** – clean state space, intuitive parity reasoning.  
2. **The bad** – pitfalls like integer overflow, wrong base cases.  
3. **The ugly** – messy recursive code that’s hard to debug and test.

Along the way, I’ll give you ready‑to‑copy code in **Java, Python, and C++**,
plus interview tips to impress hiring managers.

---

### 3.3  The Good – Why This Problem is a “Nice” DP

| Why It’s Good | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Clear problem statement** | Only one integer parameter changes; the parity condition is easy to compute. |
| **Small state space** | `pos` up to 750, `cnt` up to 749 → < 600 000 states. |
| **Monotonic transitions** | Each step only depends on the previous element’s parity. |
| **Modular arithmetic** | The answer is always taken modulo 1 000 000 007, a familiar constant. |
| **Direct application of DP** | No need for advanced combinatorics or graph theory. |

These traits make it an ideal interview question for a *mid‑level* candidate who
knows basic DP patterns.

---

### 3.4  The Bad – Common Mistakes

| Mistake | How It Happens | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Wrong parity logic** | Thinking “product minus sum is even iff both numbers are odd” | The correct condition is *same parity* (both even or both odd). |
| **Off‑by‑one in `dp` indices** | Mixing up 0‑based vs 1‑based array length | Use `dp[pos][cnt][prev]` where `pos` is the number of elements placed. |
| **Ignoring overflow** | Using `int` for intermediate multiplication (`evens * ways`) | Use `long` (Java) or `int64_t` (C++), mod after each multiplication. |
| **Unnecessary recursion depth** | Direct recursion can hit stack limits for `n=750` | Use bottom‑up DP or iterative memoization. |
| **Missing base case** | Starting `dp[0]` incorrectly | Initialize first element separately: `dp[1][0][0] = odds`, `dp[1][0][1] = evens`. |

A quick mental checklist before coding:

1. Is the parity condition correct?  
2. Are array sizes sufficient?  
3. Do I cast to 64‑bit before multiplication?  
4. Am I applying the modulo at *every* step?

---

### 3.5  The Ugly – Messy Code That Fails Interviews

Consider the following recursive template (Java):

```java
long solve(int pos, int cnt, int prev) {
    if (pos == n) return cnt == k ? 1 : 0;
    long ret = 0;
    ret += (m/2) * solve(pos+1, cnt + (prev==1?1:0), 1);
    ret += ((m+1)/2) * solve(pos+1, cnt, 0);
    return ret % MOD;
}
```

*Why it’s ugly:*

- No memoization → exponential time.  
- No pruning for `cnt > k`.  
- Mixing multiplication and modulo can overflow.  
- The first call with `prev` undefined (`-1`) leads to subtle bugs.

**Takeaway:** In an interview, you want clean, commented code that *just works*,
not a clever hack that may fail on hidden test cases.

### 3.6  Interview‑Ready Tips

| Tip | Why It Helps |
|---|---|
| **Explain the parity reduction early** | Shows you grasp the core idea, not just coding. |
| **State the DP transition clearly** | Demonstrates understanding of dynamic programming fundamentals. |
| **Show the base case for the first element** | Avoids confusion about `prev = -1`. |
| **Mention modulo handling** | Recruiters expect you to be careful with large integers. |
| **Mention complexity** | `O(n·k)` time, `O(n·k)` memory – well within limits. |
| **Ask clarifying questions** | E.g., “Is `k` always < `n`?” – reveals thoroughness. |

Also, give them a brief “edge‑case sanity check” like:

- `n = 1, k = 0` → answer should be `m`.  
- `k = 0` → no adjacent pair satisfies condition.  
- `k = n-1` → all adjacent pairs must match parity.

These small verifications can turn a decent solution into a *perfect* one.

### 3.9  FAQ (Optional Section)

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| *Can we solve it with combinatorics?* | You could, but the DP is simpler and guarantees correctness. |
| *What if `m` is 10⁹?* | Still fine – we only divide by 2 and use 64‑bit ints. |
| *Does the DP change for `k` ≥ `n`?* | It’s impossible; `k` must be < `n`. The problem statement ensures that. |

## 4.  Closing Notes

The LeetCode #3339 problem may seem obscure, but with the **parity trick** it
reduces to a classic DP.  
By presenting **clean Java, Python, and C++ implementations**, you show recruiters
that you can:

- Translate math into code.  
- Handle edge cases and modulo arithmetic.  
- Keep time & memory complexity in check.

So next time the interviewer says “Let’s see how you tackle k‑even arrays,”
you’ll be ready to explain the state, transition, and complexity in seconds
and deliver bug‑free, production‑grade code.

Happy interviewing—and may the odds (and evens) be ever in your favor!
