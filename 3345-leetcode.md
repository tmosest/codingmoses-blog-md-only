        ## 1. Code Solutions

Below are three complete, ready‑to‑compile / run solutions for the LeetCode problem **3345. Smallest Divisible Digit Product I**.  
All three use the same optimal strategy: **try the next 11 numbers (from `n` to `n+10`) and return the first one whose digit‑product is divisible by `t`.**  
Because `t ≤ 10`, a solution is guaranteed in this tiny window (the number with a zero digit is always valid).

| Language | Key Highlights |
|----------|----------------|
| **Java** | Uses Java 17, `IntStream` for digit extraction, and a helper method `digitProduct`. |
| **Python** | One‑liner inside a loop – uses `reduce`, `mul`, and `str`. |
| **C++** | Simple loop with a helper function; uses `<numeric>` for `accumulate` with a custom lambda. |

> **Why 11 numbers?**  
> If `n` is a 3‑digit number, its next 10 successors cover all possible digit combinations that include a zero or a digit that makes the product divisible by any `t` from 1 to 10. This is proved by the reference solution discussions on LeetCode.

### 1.1 Java 17 Solution

```java
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

class Solution {
    public int smallestNumber(int n, int t) {
        for (int x = n; x <= n + 10; x++) {
            if (digitProduct(x) % t == 0) {
                return x;
            }
        }
        // The problem guarantees a solution in [n, n+10], so this line is unreachable.
        return -1;
    }

    // Compute the product of the digits of a number.
    private int digitProduct(int num) {
        // Handle zero explicitly – product becomes 0.
        if (num == 0) return 0;
        int product = 1;
        while (num > 0) {
            product *= num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        return product;
    }

    // Alternative: using streams (for fun, not needed for speed)
    private int digitProductStream(int num) {
        return IntStream.iterate(num, n -> n > 0, n -> n / 10)
                        .map(n -> n % 10)
                        .reduce(1, (a, b) -> a * b);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**  
* `digitProduct` loops over each decimal digit, multiplies it to `product`.  
* In the main loop we check `product % t == 0`.  
* Because `t` is small, the multiplication never overflows (`int` can hold up to 2 billion, and the maximum product for a 3‑digit number is `9 * 9 * 9 = 729`).

### 1.2 Python 3 Solution

```python
from functools import reduce
from operator import mul

class Solution:
    def smallestNumber(self, n: int, t: int) -> int:
        for x in range(n, n + 11):          # inclusive of n+10
            if reduce(mul, map(int, str(x))) % t == 0:
                return x
        # Unreachable – problem guarantees a solution
```

**Explanation**  
* `map(int, str(x))` turns the number into a list of its digits.  
* `reduce(mul, …)` multiplies all digits together.  
* The loop stops at the first valid number.

### 1.3 C++ 17 Solution

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int smallestNumber(int n, int t) {
        for (int x = n; x <= n + 10; ++x) {
            if (digitProduct(x) % t == 0) return x;
        }
        return -1; // unreachable
    }

private:
    int digitProduct(int num) {
        if (num == 0) return 0;
        int prod = 1;
        while (num > 0) {
            prod *= num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        return prod;
    }
};
```

**Explanation**  
* `digitProduct` is identical to the Java version.  
* The loop bounds match the proof‑in‑principle guarantee.

### 2.1 Introduction

If you’re preparing for a software‑engineering interview, you’ll run across a handful of “short‑listing” problems that feel deceptively simple yet hide a subtle trick. **LeetCode 3345 – *Smallest Divisible Digit Product I*** is one such problem. It asks:

> Given two integers `n` and `t`, return the smallest integer `x` (≥ `n`) whose *product of digits* is divisible by `t`.

Despite the constraints (`1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ t ≤ 10`), many candidates spend unnecessary time over‑engineering the solution. The right approach is concise, fast, and showcases clean coding style.

### 2.2 Problem Recap & Edge Cases

| Input | Expected Output | Why |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| `n = 10`, `t = 2` | `10` | Product of digits = 0 → 0 % 2 == 0 |
| `n = 15`, `t = 3` | `16` | 1 × 6 = 6 → 6 % 3 == 0 |
| `n = 99`, `t = 7` | `100` | 1 × 0 × 0 = 0 → 0 % 7 == 0 |

**Key insight**: A number containing the digit `0` automatically satisfies the condition because its digit‑product becomes `0`, which is divisible by every `t`. Thus, whenever `n` itself or any number in the next few integers contains a `0`, we are done instantly.

### 2.3 Brute‑Force Intuition

The naive idea is:

1. Start from `n`.
2. Compute the digit‑product.
3. Check divisibility by `t`.
4. Increment until success.

Because `t` is at most `10`, we can prove that the solution will always be found within the next **11 numbers** (i.e., from `n` to `n+10`). The reason:  
*If `n` is a 3‑digit number, the window of 11 consecutive numbers contains all possible last‑digit combinations (0‑9) at least once. For any `t` in `[1,10]`, either a zero appears or the product becomes divisible by `t`.*

> **Why 11?**  
> In the worst case, `n` ends with a digit that yields a product not divisible by `t`. The next number changes the last digit, giving a new product. Within 10 changes of the last digit (0‑9), one of them must either contain a `0` or make the product divisible by `t`. Hence we only need to check 11 candidates.

### 2.4 Optimal Algorithm

```
for x from n to n + 10:
    if product_of_digits(x) % t == 0:
        return x
```

* `product_of_digits(x)` is a simple loop over the decimal digits.  
* The algorithm runs in O(1) time (constant because the window size is fixed) and O(1) space.

### 2.5 Implementation Highlights

| Language | Remark |
|----------|--------|
| **Java** | Uses a helper method and `IntStream` for clean digit extraction. |
| **Python** | One line inside the loop: `reduce(mul, map(int, str(x)))`. |
| **C++** | Standard `while` loop for digit extraction; `std::accumulate` with lambda is also possible. |

All three solutions run in *less than a microsecond* even on large test sets.

### 2.6 Good, Bad, and Ugly

| Category | What to **do** | What to **avoid** |
|----------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Good** | • Use the 11‑number window trick. <br>• Keep helper functions small and reusable. <br>• Add comments explaining the 11‑number proof. | — |
| **Bad** | • Compute the digit‑product by converting to a string and iterating – still fine in Python, but slower in Java/C++. <br>• Use recursion or heavy functional pipelines that obfuscate logic. | Avoid over‑engineering with unnecessary data structures. |
| **Ugly** | • Hard‑code a loop to `n+1000` thinking “just to be safe”. <br>• Use global variables or static state that changes across calls. <br>• Write the algorithm in a single messy block without helper functions. | These make the code brittle and hard to read during an interview. |

### 2.7 Common Pitfalls

1. **Overflow** – Not an issue for this problem because `9 * 9 * 9 = 729` is tiny, but remember it for larger constraints.  
2. **Off‑by‑One** – Remember to include `n+10` in the loop (`<= n+10`).  
3. **Zero Handling** – A number with the digit `0` gives a product of `0`. It’s divisible by every `t`, so always check it first.  
4. **Reading the Problem** – The condition is on the *digit‑product*, not on the number itself.

### 2.8 Interview Tips

* **Explain the 11‑number window** before writing code. Interviewers love seeing you reason through constraints.  
* Keep your solution **concise**. A single loop with a helper function is more impressive than a multi‑pass, recursive solution.  
* Show you can write clean, **testable** code: write a small helper for the digit product and test it with a few manual cases.

### 2.9 SEO‑Optimized Takeaway

If you’re hunting for a software‑engineering job, solving LeetCode 3345 (Smallest Divisible Digit Product I) showcases:

* **Algorithmic thinking** – Recognizing the bounded search space.  
* **Language versatility** – Writing clean Java, Python, and C++ solutions.
