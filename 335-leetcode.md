        ## 1. LeetCode 335 – **Self‑Crossing**  
**Hard**  
**Java | Python | C++** – A single‑pass, O(1)‑space solution

---

### Problem Recap

You start at `(0, 0)` on the Cartesian plane.  
You move `distance[0]` meters north, `distance[1]` meters west, `distance[2]` meters south, `distance[3]` meters east, and then repeat counter‑clockwise.  
Return `true` if any segment of the path crosses itself, otherwise `false`.

> **Input** – `int[] distance` (length up to 10⁵, values up to 10⁵)  
> **Output** – `boolean`

---

## 2. Solution Overview

The path can only cross itself in **three distinct ways**:

| Case | Intuition | Condition (index `i` ≥ 3) |
|------|-----------|----------------------------|
| **1️⃣ “Standard” crossing** | New segment touches the segment two steps earlier. | `d[i] ≥ d[i‑2] && d[i‑2] > d[i‑4] && d[i‑1] ≤ d[i‑3]` |
| **2️⃣ “Special” crossing** | New segment touches the segment three steps earlier (forming a “U‑shaped” pattern). | `i ≥ 4 && d[i‑1] == d[i‑3] && d[i] + d[i‑4] ≥ d[i‑2]` |
| **3️⃣ “Complex” crossing** | New segment touches the segment four steps earlier (overlapping two earlier segments). | `i ≥ 5 && d[i‑2] ≥ d[i‑4] && d[i] ≥ d[i‑2] - d[i‑4] && d[i‑1] ≥ d[i‑3] - d[i‑5] && d[i‑1] ≤ d[i‑3] + d[i‑5]` |

The algorithm iterates once through the array, checking these conditions.  
If any of them hold, we immediately return `true`.  
Otherwise, after the loop finishes we return `false`.

**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

### 4.1 Introduction

If you’ve spent hours staring at the **Self‑Crossing** problem on LeetCode, you’re not alone. It’s a classic **Hard** problem that many interviewees find daunting because:

- The statement looks deceptively simple, yet the edge‑case patterns are subtle.
- The path can cross itself in several non‑obvious ways.
- A brute‑force O(n²) solution will time‑out on the largest inputs (up to 10⁵).

In this article we’ll walk through **why** the problem is hard, **how** to solve it in **Java, Python, and C++**, and what interviewers really want to see from you. We’ll also dissect the **good** (clarity, efficiency), the **bad** (over‑engineering, hidden pitfalls), and the **ugly** (possible confusion points) to help you polish your solution and land that dream job.

---

### 4.2 Problem Re‑framed

> **You move in a counter‑clockwise spiral**  
>  `north → west → south → east → north → …`

> **Goal:** detect if *any* segment intersects an earlier segment.

Because you always turn 90°, the shape of the path can be thought of as a series of “steps” in four directions. A crossing only happens when a new step “snaps” back over an older step. Visualizing the path as a polygonal chain is the key to spotting patterns.

---

### 4.3 Why O(n) is the Right Approach

A naïve approach would compare every new segment with all previous segments—**O(n²)**, which fails when `n = 100,000`.  
Instead, notice that a crossing can only involve the *last three* or *last four* segments.  
Why? Because each move is 90° counter‑clockwise, so only the most recent steps can align to create an intersection. This observation gives rise to the **three crossing cases** described earlier.

---

### 4.4 The Three Crossing Patterns

1. **Standard Crossing**  
   *New segment reaches or exceeds the length of the segment two steps back, but the preceding segment is short enough to keep the new one from over‑extending.*

2. **Special U‑Shaped Crossing**  
   *The new segment meets the segment three steps back. The “arms” of the U must overlap sufficiently.*

3. **Complex Overlap**  
   *The new segment intersects a segment that is four steps back, with a more intricate overlap involving two earlier segments.*

These patterns translate directly into the conditions used in the code above.  

---

### 4.5 Implementation Walk‑Through

#### Java

- **Loop from index 3** because the first possible crossing needs at least four moves.
- **Three `if` blocks** each representing one of the crossing patterns.
- **Return `true`** immediately when a crossing is detected.
- **Return `false`** if the loop finishes.

> **Why this is good:**  
>  *Single pass, constant memory, clear naming of variables.*

#### Python

- Same logic, but takes advantage of Python’s clean syntax.
- Uses `range(3, n)` for clarity.
- Commented sections help interviewers see your reasoning.

> **Why this is good:**  
>  *Readable, no boilerplate, fast to type.*

#### C++

- Uses `vector<int>&` to avoid copying.
- `int n = distance.size();` – standard C++ idiom.
- Same three condition checks.

> **Why this is good:**  
>  *Compact, uses references to avoid overhead.*

### 4.6 Good, Bad, Ugly – A Critical Review

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Time Complexity** | O(n) – optimal | None | N/A |
| **Space Usage** | O(1) – constant | None | N/A |
| **Readability** | Clear, commented, single‑pass | Potential confusion: indices may be off by 1 for beginners | Mis‑indexing leads to subtle bugs |
| **Edge‑Case Handling** | Handles all 3 crossing patterns, no overflow (int up to 1e5) | None | Forgetting `i >= 4` or `i >= 5` leads to out‑of‑bounds |
| **Testing** | Quick unit tests with 3 cases (provided by LeetCode) | None | Not testing the “U‑shaped” or “overlap” cases can give false positives |
| **Scalability** | Works for maximum input size | None | Hard‑coded 100 000 limits could mislead beginners |

**Takeaway:** The “ugly” part is often the off‑by‑one errors and forgetting to guard against negative indices. Write unit tests that explicitly exercise each crossing scenario.

### 4.7 Interview‑Ready Tips

1. **Explain the intuition first.**  
   Before diving into code, sketch the three patterns on a whiteboard (or in your head). Interviewers value clear thinking.

2. **State the complexity.**  
   “We’ll loop once; that’s O(n) time and O(1) memory.”

3. **Edge Cases.**  
   - Length < 4 → never cross.  
   - Distances can be equal or decreasing.  
   - “U‑shaped” crossing may not be obvious.

4. **Test on sample inputs.**  
   - `[2,1,1,2]` → true.  
   - `[1,2,3,4]` → false.  
   - `[1,1,1,2,1]` → true.

5. **Mention the 3 conditions explicitly.**  
   “We check three patterns: standard, U‑shaped, and complex overlap.”  
   This shows you understand why you need multiple checks.
