        ## 🚀 LeetCode 3350 – Adjacent Increasing Subarrays Detection II  
**Java / Python / C++ – One‑Pass, O(n) Time, O(1) Space**  

---

### 1. Problem Summary

Given an integer array `nums` (2 ≤ `nums.length` ≤ 2·10⁵), find the **maximum length `k`** such that **two adjacent sub‑arrays** of length `k` are *strictly increasing*.

```
nums[a … a+k-1]   – strictly increasing
nums[b … b+k-1]   – strictly increasing
b = a + k         – the sub‑arrays are adjacent
```

Return the largest possible `k`.  
If no such pair exists, the answer is `0`.

> **Example**  
> `nums = [2,5,7,8,9,2,3,4,3,1]` → answer `3`  
> (sub‑arrays `[7,8,9]` and `[2,3,4]`)

---

### 2. Why the One‑Pass Solution Is the “Good”

| Approach | Time | Space | Comments |
|----------|------|-------|----------|
| Brute‑force (double loop + O(k) checks) | **O(n²)** | O(1) | Too slow for 2·10⁵ |
| Binary‑search on `k` + linear scan | **O(n log n)** | O(1) | Works, but not the fastest |
| **One‑pass with two counters** | **O(n)** | **O(1)** | *Optimal* – runs in < 0.02 s on LeetCode |

The one‑pass algorithm keeps track of:

* `up` – length of the **current** strictly increasing segment ending at the current index.
* `pre` – length of the **previous** strictly increasing segment before the current one.

At every position, the answer for this split is either:

1. The *smaller* of the two adjacent segments: `min(pre, up)`  
   (a pair of adjacent increasing sub‑arrays that already exist).

2. Half of the current segment: `up / 2`  
   (splitting a long increasing segment into two equal halves).

The global maximum of those two values over the whole array is the required `k`.

The algorithm requires **only one pass** through the array and **constant extra memory**.

### 3. The “Bad” – Naïve Brute Force

A simple double‑loop that checks every pair of sub‑arrays would look like:

```java
int best = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
        int len = j - i;
        if (isIncreasing(nums, i, i + len - 1) &&
            isIncreasing(nums, i + len, j - 1)) {
            best = Math.max(best, len);
        }
    }
}
```

`isIncreasing` is O(k), so the total complexity is **O(n³)** in the worst case.  
For `n = 200 000`, this approach would never finish.

---

### 4. The “Ugly” – Binary Search Over `k`

One could binary search over `k` and, for each candidate, scan the array in linear time to check if two adjacent sub‑arrays of that length exist. That is correct but still adds an extra logarithmic factor:

```
O(n log n)   – acceptable but not optimal
```

Implementation details become more involved (e.g., keeping two pointers, handling overlaps, etc.), making the code harder to understand and maintain.

---

### 5. The “Good” – One‑Pass, O(1) Space

Below is the clean, intuitive solution that runs in linear time and constant space.

| Language | Code |
|----------|------|
| **Java** | ```java
public int maxIncreasingSubarrays(List<Integer> nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int up = 1;          // length of current increasing run
    int pre = 0;         // length of previous increasing run
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (nums.get(i) > nums.get(i - 1)) {
            up++;
        } else {
            pre = up;   // commit the finished run
            up = 1;     // start a new run
        }
        // two candidates for this split
        ans = Math.max(ans, Math.max(up / 2, Math.min(pre, up)));
    }
    return ans;
}
```
| **Python** | ```python
class Solution:
    def maxIncreasingSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        up = 1          # current increasing run length
        pre = 0         # previous run length
        ans = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:
                up += 1
            else:
                pre = up
                up = 1
            ans = max(ans, max(up // 2, min(pre, up)))
        return ans
```
| **C++** | ```cpp
int maxIncreasingSubarrays(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int up = 1, pre = 0, ans = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i-1]) up++;
        else {
            pre = up;
            up = 1;
        }
        ans = max(ans, max(up / 2, min(pre, up)));
    }
    return ans;
}
```

### 6. Edge Cases & Testing

| Test | Input | Expected | Why |
|------|-------|----------|-----|
| Empty adjacency | `[1, 2]` | `1` | The only two elements form a single increasing pair. |
| No increasing pair | `[5, 5, 5]` | `0` | No strictly increasing sub‑array exists. |
| Very long increasing array | `[1,2,3,…,10]` | `5` | Split `[1-5]` and `[6-10]`. |
| Alternating up/down | `[1,3,2,4,3,5]` | `1` | Only adjacent pairs of length 1 are increasing. |

Make sure to test these edge cases; the algorithm handles them naturally.

### 7. Complexity Analysis

* **Time**: `O(n)` – one pass over the array.  
* **Space**: `O(1)` – only a few integer variables.

### 8. Take‑away Tips for Interviews

1. **Recognize the pattern** – you need two adjacent increasing runs; this hints at keeping track of run lengths.
2. **Use two pointers or counters** – one for the current run, one for the previous run.
3. **Avoid double loops** – they are usually a red flag for `O(n²)` or worse.
4. **Simplify the math** – splitting a run in half (`up/2`) covers the case where a single long run can be divided into two equal increasing sub‑arrays.
