        ## 1Ô∏è‚É£  The Code ‚Äì 3 Languages

Below are clean, production‚Äëready implementations for **Java**, **Python**, and **C++** that solve LeetCode 3353 ‚Äì *Minimum Total Operations*.  
All three follow the same logic: scan the array from right‚Äëto‚Äëleft and count how many times an element differs from its right neighbour. That count is the minimal number of prefix‚Äëadd operations needed.

> **Why this works**  
> An operation can only modify a prefix. If you walk from the end of the array to the front, each time you hit a new value you must perform *one* operation to turn the left part into that value. No extra operations are ever needed, and you can never do fewer than that because each new value forces a change.

---

### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        // Empty or single‚Äëelement arrays already satisfy the condition.
        if (nums.length <= 1) return 0;

        int operations = 0;
        // Scan from the second‚Äëlast element to the front.
        for (int i = nums.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[i + 1]) {
                operations++;
            }
        }
        return operations;
    }
}
```

---

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) <= 1:
            return 0

        ops = 0
        # iterate from right‚Äëto‚Äëleft, compare each element with its right neighbour
        for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1):
            if nums[i] != nums[i + 1]:
                ops += 1
        return ops
```

---

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() <= 1) return 0;

        int ops = 0;
        for (int i = (int)nums.size() - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[i + 1]) ++ops;
        }
        return ops;
    }
};
```

All three solutions run in **O(n)** time and use **O(1)** additional space.

### üìå  Introduction

If you‚Äôre hunting for a software engineering role, you‚Äôve probably hit the *‚Äúeasy‚Äù* section of LeetCode a few times. One deceptively simple problem that frequently turns up in interviews is **LeetCode 3353 ‚Äì Minimum Total Operations**.  

At first glance the description looks like a candidate for dynamic programming or a greedy sweep, but the real solution is a *single linear pass*. In this article we dissect the problem, show the *good* simple solution, expose the *bad* over‚Äëengineering traps, and warn you about the *ugly* edge cases that can trip you up in an interview.

### üß©  Problem Recap

> **Given** an array `nums` (length up to 10‚Åµ, values in [‚àí10‚Åπ, 10‚Åπ]).  
> **Operation**: Pick any prefix, add an integer `k` (can be negative) to *every* element in that prefix.  
> **Goal**: Make all elements equal using the minimum number of operations.

### üèóÔ∏è  The ‚ÄúGood‚Äù ‚Äì A One‚ÄëPass Counting Solution

#### Why It Works

* Each operation can change only the *prefix*.
* Starting from the rightmost element, the array to its right is already ‚Äúfixed‚Äù.
* Whenever you encounter a new value that differs from the value immediately to its right, **exactly one** operation is mandatory to bring the left side up to that value.
* No extra operations can reduce the count further.

#### Algorithm

1. If the array length ‚â§ 1 ‚Üí 0 operations.  
2. Iterate from index `n-2` down to `0`.  
3. If `nums[i] != nums[i+1]`, increment counter.  
4. Return counter.

#### Complexity

* **Time**: O(n) ‚Äì one linear pass.  
* **Space**: O(1) ‚Äì only a few variables.

### üîç  The ‚ÄúBad‚Äù ‚Äì Over‚Äëengineering Pitfalls

| Mistake | What Happens | How to Fix |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **DP/Graph modeling** | Adds unnecessary complexity, over‚Äëtime limits. | Stick to the linear sweep. |
| **Using a stack or set** | Increases memory usage and mis‚Äëinterprets the operation‚Äôs nature. | A simple counter is enough. |
| **Early exit on first duplicate** | Returns wrong answer for arrays like `[1,1,2,2]`. | Count *all* transitions, not just the first. |

> **Lesson**: Always question whether a more complex data structure is truly needed. For this problem, the operation structure eliminates the need for advanced structures.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è  The ‚ÄúUgly‚Äù ‚Äì Edge Cases & Common Mistakes

| Edge Case | Why It Breaks | Quick Check |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Single element array | Loop starts at `n-2` ‚Üí negative index. | Handle `n <= 1` separately. |
| All identical elements | Must return 0, not n-1. | Count transitions, not length minus one. |
| Alternating values | `[1,2,1,2]` ‚Üí 3 operations. | Count every change. |
| Large negative numbers | Overflow not an issue in Java/Python/C++ due to built‚Äëin int types, but beware of 32‚Äëbit overflow in languages with fixed int sizes. | Use `long` in Java if you want to be safe. |

### üìà  Interview‚ÄëReady Tips

1. **Explain the intuition**: Talk about ‚Äúfixing from right to left‚Äù and why a change forces an operation.
2. **Show an example** on the whiteboard: `[1,4,2]` ‚Üí walk through the scan.
3. **Mention complexity** up front.  `O(n)` time, `O(1)` space.
4. **Discuss constraints**: 10‚Åµ length ‚Üí linear time is mandatory; no DP or recursion.
5. **Ask clarifying questions**: ‚ÄúCan we add negative `k`?‚Äù (Yes, it‚Äôs allowed).
6. **Mention the final code** and run a quick test.

### üí°  Takeaway

LeetCode 3353 is a *clean* problem that teaches you two things:

1. **Prefix operations can be reduced to a counting problem.**  
2. **Always search for a linear‚Äëscan solution before building a DP or using heavy data structures.**

This knowledge not only helps you solve the problem in seconds but also demonstrates to interviewers that you can spot the simplest path to a correct, efficient solution.
