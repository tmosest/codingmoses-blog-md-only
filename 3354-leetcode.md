### 1.1  Java  (LeetCode “Solution” class)

```java
/**
 * 3354. Make Array Elements Equal to Zero
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/make-array-elements-equal-to-zero
 */
class Solution {
    public int countValidSelections(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int total = 0;
        for (int v : nums) total += v;        // total sum of the array

        int leftSum = 0;      // sum of elements left of current index (exclusive)
        int rightSum = total; // sum of elements from current index to end (inclusive)

        int answer = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            rightSum -= nums[i];   // now rightSum is sum of elements strictly right of i

            if (nums[i] != 0) {        // non‑zero elements are irrelevant for start positions
                leftSum += nums[i];
                continue;
            }

            /*
             *  At a zero position we need to check the difference
             *  between the sum of elements on the left and the sum on the right.
             *
             *  Condition 1:  leftSum == rightSum   -> both directions are valid
             *  Condition 2: |leftSum - rightSum| == 1  -> only one direction works
             */
            if (leftSum == rightSum) {
                answer += 2;
            } else if (Math.abs(leftSum - rightSum) == 1) {
                answer += 1;
            }

            leftSum += nums[i];   // include the zero itself for subsequent steps
        }

        return answer;
    }
}
```

### 1.2  Python  (Python 3)

```python
class Solution:
    def countValidSelections(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        total = sum(nums)
        left_sum = 0          # elements left of i
        right_sum = total     # elements from i to end

        ans = 0
        for v in nums:
            right_sum -= v     # now `right_sum` is strictly to the right

            if v:             # skip non‑zero entries – they cannot be a starting point
                left_sum += v
                continue

            if left_sum == right_sum:
                ans += 2
            elif abs(left_sum - right_sum) == 1:
                ans += 1

            left_sum += v     # include the zero itself

        return ans
```

### 1.3  C++  (single function)

```cpp
/**
 * 3354. Make Array Elements Equal to Zero
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/make-array-elements-equal-to-zero
 */
int countValidSelections(vector<int>& nums) {
    long long total = 0;
    for (int v : nums) total += v;          // use long long to avoid overflow

    long long left = 0;       // sum of elements left of current index
    long long right = total;  // sum of elements from current index to end

    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        right -= nums[i];     // remove the current element – right is now strictly to the right

        if (nums[i] != 0) {
            left += nums[i];
            continue;
        }

        if (left == right)          res += 2;
        else if (llabs(left - right) == 1)  res += 1;

        left += nums[i];           // include the zero for the next iteration
    }
    return res;
}
```

> *Tip – for the C++ solution you can also drop the `llabs` by using `abs(left - right)`; the compiler will promote to `int`.  
>  The `long long` guard keeps the code safe for the worst‑case sum (n ≤ 200 000, a[i] ≤ 10⁹).*

## 2.  How the Algorithm Works – The 3‑Minute “Logic” Walk‑through

| Step | What we do | Why it works |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **1** | Compute the *total* sum of the array (`total`). | The rules guarantee that the total number of decrements equals the total number of increments, so the total sum is a useful constant. |
| **2** | Walk through the array once, maintaining two running sums: `leftSum` (strictly left of the current index) and `rightSum` (strictly right of the current index). | These two values are the *effective* “load” on each side of a zero; they decide which direction(s) can clear the array. |
| **3** | At a zero position:  *if* `leftSum == rightSum` → **both** left and right moves are valid → `+2`.  *Else if* `|leftSum - rightSum| == 1` → **one** direction works → `+1`. | The movement rules force the “pointer” to first step onto the larger side; a difference of 1 guarantees that exactly one direction can compensate the extra value. |
| **4** | Update the running sums for the next element (`leftSum += nums[i]`). | Ensures that when we reach the next zero the left/right totals are correct. |

> **Complexities**  
> •  *Time*: **O(n)** – each element is processed a single time.  
> •  *Space*: **O(1)** – only a handful of integer variables are used.

## 3.  The Blog Article – “Good, Bad, Ugly” with Job‑Search‑Ready SEO

> **Title (SEO)**  
> **Cracking LeetCode 3354 – The “Make Array Elements Equal to Zero” Interview Puzzle (Java, Python, C++)**

> **Meta‑Description**  
> “Learn how to solve LeetCode 3354 in Java, Python, and C++ in one pass with O(n) time and O(1) space. Understand prefix sums, edge‑case handling, and how this problem can boost your interview resume.”

### 3.1  Introduction

Interviews often hinge on your ability to *think clearly, code cleanly and explain your reasoning.*  
LeetCode 3354 is a perfect showcase of all three skills.  The task is deceptively simple: given an array of integers that contains at least one `0`, count **all** possible starting positions **and** the first‑step direction (`+1` or `-1`) that will, by following the prescribed “decrement‑increment” rules, reduce the whole array to zeroes.

**Key takeaway for recruiters** – the solution is a single linear scan with constant auxiliary storage – a classic interview pattern.

---

### 3.2  The “Good” – What You Love About This Problem

1. **Linear‑time, Constant‑space**  
   A one‑pass algorithm is a staple of coding interviews.  It signals that you can optimize for speed and memory – both prized traits in software engineering.

2. **Prefix Sums, No Extra Arrays**  
   The solution uses running totals (`leftSum` and `rightSum`) instead of building full prefix arrays.  This demonstrates a deep understanding of *prefix sum* tricks that interviewers often ask about.

3. **Clear Decision Logic**  
   The two simple conditions – `left == right` (two directions) and `|left - right| == 1` (one direction) – are easy to reason about and can be explained in under a minute.  Interviewers love solutions that can be verbalised succinctly.

4. **Language‑agnostic**  
   The same logic can be expressed in Java, Python or C++.  Highlighting this versatility shows you’re comfortable with multiple stacks – an advantage in a modern, polyglot team.

### 3.3  The “Bad” – Common Pitfalls You Should Avoid

| Pitfall | What Happens | How to Fix |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **Multiple zeros** | Assuming only the first zero matters. | Iterate from the first zero to the end, updating `leftSum` and `rightSum` for *every* zero. |
| **Updating sums wrong order** | `rightSum` should exclude the current element before the check. | Subtract `nums[i]` *before* evaluating the zero‑condition. |
| **Using long vs int** | Overflow on large inputs (`n ≤ 200 000`, `a[i] ≤ 10⁹`). | Keep the cumulative sums in `long` (Java) or `long long` (C++). |
| **Counting duplicates** | Adding 2 for every equal sum may double‑count when `left == right` and `|diff| == 1` simultaneously. | The conditions are exclusive; use `if/else if`. |
| **Mis‑reading “strictly right”** | Off‑by‑one error on `rightSum`. | Subtract the current element *before* checking the zero. |

### 3.4  The “Ugly” – The Brute‑Force Approach (Why It’s a No‑Go)

A tempting but disastrous approach is to:

1. **Simulate the process** for every zero and for both directions.  
2. **Apply the decrement/ increment rule** step‑by‑step until the array stabilises or the simulation stalls.  

This naïve method is **O(n²)** in the worst case (every element could be visited many times).  It will *time‑out* on LeetCode’s limits and will make recruiters suspicious of your optimisation skills.

> **Lesson** – always look for a mathematical shortcut (prefix sums, balances, invariants) before writing a simulation.

---

### 3.5  What to Highlight in Your Interview

* **State the invariant** – “At any zero, the difference between the sum of left elements and right elements determines the valid directions.”  
* **Explain the time complexity** – a single loop, no nested operations.  
* **Mention the space optimisation** – no extra arrays, just a couple of integers.  
* **Show the clean code** – use descriptive variable names (`leftSum`, `rightSum`) and concise comments.  

You can even bring up the *“first‑zero trick”* if you want to impress a recruiter who loves clever tricks: compute `leftSum` up to the first zero, `rightSum` from that zero to the end, and slide the window forward.

### 3.6  Final Thought

LeetCode 3354 is a *tiny* problem with *big* teaching value:

* It demonstrates how to turn a game‑like rule into a simple arithmetic condition.  
* It shows mastery of prefix sums, a staple of many interview problems (e.g., “Maximum Subarray”, “Prefix Sum Search”).  
* It highlights the importance of handling edge cases – zeros at the start, end or in the middle of the array.

When you hit this problem in an interview, walk through the logic on paper first, then translate it into clean code.  That way you’ll demonstrate *clarity of thought*, *algorithmic insight* and *coding discipline* – all of which are the holy trinity of a strong software‑engineering interview performance.

Good luck! 🚀
