        ## 🪨 3360. Stone Removal Game – Code, Analysis & a “Good‑Bad‑Ugly” Blog Post

> **Target audience** – Java, Python & C++ developers preparing for coding interviews.  
> **Goal** – Show a clean, interview‑ready solution + an SEO‑friendly blog post that can help you land a job.

## 1. Problem Recap

> **Stone Removal Game**  
> Alice starts by removing **exactly 10** stones.  
> Every subsequent move removes **one stone less** than the *previous opponent*’s move.  
> The player who can’t move loses.  
> `n` is the total number of stones (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

Return `true` if Alice wins, otherwise `false`.

---

## 2. Solution Idea

Because `n` is tiny and the sequence of moves is strictly decreasing, a simple **simulation** is enough.

1. **turn** – 0 for Alice, 1 for Bob.  
2. **stonesToRemove** – start at 10.  
3. While the pile still contains enough stones:
   * `n -= stonesToRemove`
   * `stonesToRemove--`
   * flip the turn.
4. After the loop ends, the last player who *could* make a move is the one whose turn **was flipped to** the other side.  
5. Alice wins if the final `turn` is **1** (meaning Bob just tried and failed, so Alice is the winner).

The simulation stops after at most 10 iterations because the first move already consumes 10 stones.

## 3. Code

### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean canAliceWin(int n) {
        int turn = 0;          // 0 → Alice, 1 → Bob
        int stonesToRemove = 10;
        while (n >= stonesToRemove) {
            n -= stonesToRemove;
            stonesToRemove--; // next move is one stone less
            turn ^= 1;        // flip player
        }
        return turn == 1;     // if turn == 1, Alice won
    }
}
```

> **Time** : *O(k)*, where *k* ≤ 10.  
> **Space** : *O(1)*.

---

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def canAliceWin(self, n: int) -> bool:
        turn = 0          # 0 → Alice, 1 → Bob
        stones_to_remove = 10
        while n >= stones_to_remove:
            n -= stones_to_remove
            stones_to_remove -= 1
            turn ^= 1
        return turn == 1
```

> **Time** : *O(k)*, *k* ≤ 10.  
> **Space** : *O(1)*.

---

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canAliceWin(int n) {
        int turn = 0;              // 0 = Alice, 1 = Bob
        int stonesToRemove = 10;
        while (n >= stonesToRemove) {
            n -= stonesToRemove;
            --stonesToRemove;
            turn ^= 1;              // flip turn
        }
        return turn == 1;          // Alice wins if Bob just failed
    }
};
```

> **Time** : *O(k)*, *k* ≤ 10.  
> **Space** : *O(1)*.

### 1. Introduction

In coding interviews, Leetcode often pushes you to spot the *hidden pattern* behind a seemingly complex game.  
Stone Removal Game is a perfect example – it’s **Easy** but still teaches you a valuable lesson: *often the simplest approach wins.*

---

### 2. Problem Overview

- **Alice** starts with a **fixed** 10‑stone move.  
- Each following turn removes **one less** stone than the previous opponent’s move.  
- The player who cannot move loses.  
- We’re given `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and must return `true` if Alice can force a win.

---

### 3. The Good – Why the Simple Simulation Rocks

| ✔️ | Feature |
|---|---------|
| **Clarity** | The simulation follows the exact rules – no algebraic magic needed. |
| **Correctness** | By mirroring the real game, we guarantee a correct result for all `n`. |
| **Speed** | With at most 10 iterations, runtime is *micro‑seconds* regardless of language. |
| **Readability** | Interviewers appreciate code that is *easy to read* and *easy to debug*. |
| **Extensibility** | If the problem changes (e.g., starting move = 20), the same structure works. |

---

### 4. The Bad – Potential Pitfalls & Over‑thinking

1. **Mathematical Derivation** – Trying to find a formula (e.g., `n % 11 == 0` or similar) can be misleading; the constraints are too small for pattern hunting.  
2. **Dynamic Programming** – Over‑engineering for a 50‑stone game wastes time.  
3. **Recursive Backtracking** – Will still work, but adds stack overhead and risk of stack overflow if constraints grow.  

Bottom line: *Keep it simple.* Interviewers will be impressed by a clean greedy solution rather than a complex one.

---

### 5. The Ugly – Common Interview Traps

| ❌ | Issue | Fix |
|---|-------|-----|
| **Off‑by‑One in the turn logic** | Using `turn = 1 - turn` may confuse; a more explicit flip (`turn ^= 1`) is clearer. | Use XOR or a boolean toggle. |
| **Assuming Alice always wins** | Misreading the “cannot move” rule can lead to returning the wrong player. | Remember: the *player* who cannot move *loses*, so the winner is the one who made the last successful move. |
| **Neglecting the first 10‑stone rule** | Starting with a variable (e.g., `stones = 1`) will break the simulation. | Hard‑code `stonesToRemove = 10`. |
| **Not testing edge cases** | Forgetting `n < 10` means Alice immediately loses. | Include tests for `n = 1…9`. |
| **Mis‑interpreting “one fewer than the previous opponent”** | Some think “the previous *own* move” instead of the opponent’s. | Track the *previous opponent* move; simulation does that naturally. |

---

### 6. Code Walk‑through

#### Java

```java
int turn = 0;          // 0 → Alice, 1 → Bob
int stonesToRemove = 10;
while (n >= stonesToRemove) {
    n -= stonesToRemove;
    stonesToRemove--;
    turn ^= 1;        // flip player
}
return turn == 1;     // Alice wins if Bob failed
```

*Why `turn ^= 1`?* It flips between 0 and 1 in O(1) time, making the code terse yet clear.

#### Python

```python
turn = 0
stones_to_remove = 10
while n >= stones_to_remove:
    n -= stones_to_remove
    stones_to_remove -= 1
    turn ^= 1
return turn == 1
```

Python’s `^= 1` works the same as Java’s XOR.

#### C++

```cpp
int turn = 0;
int stonesToRemove = 10;
while (n >= stonesToRemove) {
    n -= stonesToRemove;
    --stonesToRemove;
    turn ^= 1;
}
return turn == 1;
```

---

### 7. Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Time | Space |
|--------|------|-------|
| Worst‑case | **O(10)** → **O(1)** (constant, since at most 10 iterations) | **O(1)** |

Even for an unconstrained `n`, the loop would run roughly `√(2n)` times because the sum of the decreasing series is quadratic, so the algorithm remains efficient.

---

### 8. Edge Cases & Test Strategy

| n | Expected | Reason |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1–9 | `false` | Alice cannot remove 10 stones. |
| 10 | `true` | Alice removes all stones → Bob loses. |
| 11–18 | `false` | After Alice’s 10, Bob cannot remove 9. |
| 19 | `true` | Alice 10 → 9, Bob 9 → 10, Alice 10 wins. |
| 50 | `true` | Full simulation confirms Alice’s win. |

**Testing Tip**: Use a brute‑force script that simulates all `n` values (1‑50) to verify your implementation.  
In interviews, you can mention this “sanity check” to show thoroughness.

---

### 9. Interview‑Ready Tips

1. **Explain the intuition**: “We can literally simulate the game because the first move is fixed and the sequence is short.”
2. **State complexity up front**: “O(1) time, O(1) space – trivial for interview.”
3. **Mention edge cases**: “If `n < 10`, Alice loses immediately.”
4. **Show alternative (DP)**: Briefly say, “A DP approach would work too but is overkill here.”
5. **Ask clarifying questions**: “Just to confirm, the second move always removes one less than Alice’s first move, right?”

---

### 10. Conclusion & Takeaway

The Stone Removal Game demonstrates that *cleverness* is not always about fancy mathematics; sometimes the best solution is a faithful, straightforward simulation.  
By delivering clean, well‑commented Java, Python, or C++ code—paired with an interview‑ready explanation—you showcase:

- **Problem comprehension**  
- **Algorithmic clarity**  
- **Coding style**  
- **Attention to edge cases**

All three are prized by hiring managers. Happy coding and good luck landing that dream role! 🚀
