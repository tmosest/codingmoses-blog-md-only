        ## üì¶ 3360. Stone Removal Game ‚Äì Code, Theory & Interview‚ÄëReady Blog Post  
*(Java | Python | C++)*  

---

### TL;DR  
- **Problem**: Two players alternately remove stones from a pile.  
  *Alice* starts by removing **exactly 10** stones.  
  Every subsequent move removes **one stone less** than the opponent‚Äôs last move.  
  Whoever can‚Äôt move loses.  
- **Goal**: Return `true` if Alice wins for a given `n`, otherwise `false`.  
- **Observation**: The game is completely deterministic ‚Äì just simulate the decreasing sequence `10, 9, 8, ‚Ä¶`.  
- **Complexity**: `O(k)` where `k ‚â§ 10` (since the first move is 10).  
- **Implementation**: Straight‚Äëforward loop in Java, Python, and C++.

> **Pro tip**: The pattern is ‚Äúfirst move 10, then 9, ‚Ä¶‚Äù.  
> After each subtraction, flip the player.  
> When you can‚Äôt subtract, the current player loses, so the *other* player wins.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement

> **Stone Removal Game**  
> *Alice and Bob play a game with a pile of `n` stones.*  
> 1. Alice starts, removing **exactly 10** stones.  
> 2. On each subsequent turn a player removes **1 stone less** than the opponent‚Äôs last move.  
> 3. If a player cannot make a move (i.e., the remaining stones are less than the required removal), they lose.  
> **Return** `true` if Alice wins, otherwise `false`.

> **Constraints**: `1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 50`  
> **Example**  
> `n = 12` ‚Üí Alice takes 10 ‚Üí 2 stones left ‚Üí Bob needs 9 ‚Üí can't ‚Üí **Alice wins**.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Intuition & ‚ÄúGood, Bad, Ugly‚Äù Breakdown

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Simplicity** | O(1) loop with at most 10 iterations. | None. | ‚Äî |
| **Deterministic** | No branching, no recursion. | None. | ‚Äî |
| **Edge Cases** | Handles `n < 10` automatically. | None. | ‚Äî |
| **Readability** | Clear variable names (`stonesToRemove`, `turn`). | None. | ‚Äî |
| **Scalability** | Works for any upper bound because loop length ‚â§ 10. | If the first move changed to a variable `k`, still O(k). | ‚Äî |

> **Why it‚Äôs ‚Äúgood‚Äù** ‚Äì the greedy simulation is literally the rule set; no clever math tricks required.  
> **Why it‚Äôs ‚Äúbad‚Äù** ‚Äì some might try over‚Äëengineering (dynamic programming, memoization) when a one‚Äëliner loop suffices.  
> **Why it‚Äôs ‚Äúugly‚Äù** ‚Äì the only trick is remembering to flip the player after each turn; a tiny slip will give the wrong answer.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```
turn = 0            // 0 ‚Üí Alice, 1 ‚Üí Bob
stonesToRemove = 10

while n >= stonesToRemove:
    n -= stonesToRemove
    stonesToRemove -= 1
    turn = 1 - turn   // switch player

return turn == 1      // if last turn was Bob ‚Üí Alice wins
```

The loop stops when the current player cannot make the required move.  
`turn` indicates the *player who just moved*.  
If the loop ends because the *next* player cannot move, the winner is the one who just moved (`turn`).

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Code Implementations

### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canAliceWin(int n) {
        int turn = 0;          // 0 = Alice, 1 = Bob
        int stonesToRemove = 10;

        while (n >= stonesToRemove) {
            n -= stonesToRemove;
            stonesToRemove--;
            turn = 1 - turn;  // switch player
        }
        return turn == 1;     // Bob just moved, Alice wins
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def canAliceWin(self, n: int) -> bool:
        turn = 0          # 0 = Alice, 1 = Bob
        stones_to_remove = 10

        while n >= stones_to_remove:
            n -= stones_to_remove
            stones_to_remove -= 1
            turn ^= 1     # flip 0/1

        return turn == 1
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canAliceWin(int n) {
        int turn = 0;          // 0 = Alice, 1 = Bob
        int stonesToRemove = 10;

        while (n >= stonesToRemove) {
            n -= stonesToRemove;
            --stonesToRemove;
            turn ^= 1;         // toggle 0/1
        }
        return turn == 1;      // Bob just moved ‚Üí Alice wins
    }
};
```

All three solutions run in **O(1)** time and **O(1)** space.  
The loop executes at most 10 iterations (for `n = 50`), so the runtime is essentially constant.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Complexity Analysis

| Complexity | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| **Time**   | At most 10 iterations ‚Üí **O(1)** |
| **Space**  | Constant auxiliary variables ‚Üí **O(1)** |

Even with a higher upper bound on `n`, the loop would still run at most `min(10, n)` times because the removal count decreases by one each turn.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Testing & Edge Cases

| `n` | Expected | Explanation |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| 1   | `false`  | Alice cannot remove 10 stones. |
| 10  | `true`   | Alice takes all stones, Bob loses immediately. |
| 11  | `false`  | Alice takes 10 ‚Üí 1 left ‚Üí Bob needs 9 ‚Üí loses. |
| 12  | `true`   | Example from statement. |
| 50  | `false`  | Full simulation: Alice (10), Bob (9), Alice (8), ‚Ä¶ until Bob cannot move. |

Run a quick unit test in your language of choice to verify the above cases.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Interview‚ÄëReady Tips

| Tip | Why It Helps |
|-----|--------------|
| **Explain the rule** before coding. | Shows you understand the problem constraints. |
| **State the invariant**: ‚ÄúThe remaining stones are `n`, next removal is `k`.‚Äù | Keeps the solution clean. |
| **Avoid DP**. | Interviewers appreciate the minimal‚Äëwork solution. |
| **Mention edge case** (`n < 10`). | Demonstrates thoroughness. |
| **Show the winner logic** (`turn == 1`). | Clarifies who actually wins when the loop ends. |
