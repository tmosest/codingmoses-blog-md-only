## 1.  Code – Java / Python / C++  (Zero Array Transformation III)

```text
LeetCode 2719 – Zero Array Transformation III
```

| Language | File name | Highlights |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Java** | `Solution.java` | Uses `Arrays.sort` + two `PriorityQueue`s (max‑heap for ends, min‑heap for already‑used queries) |
| **Python** | `solution.py` | Uses `heapq` + two counters – one for active queries, one for “used” intervals |
| **C++** | `Solution.cpp` | Uses `sort`, `priority_queue<int>` (max‑heap) and a vector of “decrement credits” |

> **NOTE** – All three implementations follow the same *greedy + line‑sweep* strategy that guarantees the minimum number of operations required.  
> The answer is simply `totalQueries – usedQueries` (or the heap size left after the sweep).

### 1.1  Java Implementation

```java
//  ---------  LeetCode 2719 – Zero Array Transformation III  ---------
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    /**
     * @param A   array of integers (nums)
     * @param queries list of [l,r] operations
     * @return maximum number of removable queries or -1 if impossible
     */
    public int maxRemoval(int[] A, int[][] queries) {
        int n = A.length, q = queries.length;

        // 1️⃣  Sort queries by start index (l)
        Arrays.sort(queries, (x, y) -> Integer.compare(x[0], y[0]));

        // 2️⃣  Max‑heap for all ends of “available” queries
        PriorityQueue<Integer> h = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());

        // 3️⃣  endCount[i] – how many chosen queries finish *after* position i
        int[] endCount = new int[n + 1];
        int used = 0;          // number of currently active queries
        int pos   = 0;          // index in queries[]

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // remove queries that have just ended
            used -= endCount[i];

            // add new queries that start at or before i
            while (pos < q && queries[pos][0] <= i) {
                h.offer(queries[pos][1]);   // push end index
                pos++;
            }

            // we need A[i] decrements on position i
            while (used < A[i]) {
                if (h.isEmpty() || h.peek() < i) {   // no usable query
                    return -1;
                }
                int e = h.poll();                    // pick the query ending farthest
                endCount[e + 1]++;                   // it will stop affecting after e
                used++;                              // we now have one more active query
            }
        }

        /*  Extra queries = all queries that never got chosen   */
        return queries.length - used;
    }
}
```

### 1.2  Python Implementation

```python
#  ---------  LeetCode 2719 – Zero Array Transformation III  ---------
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxRemoval(self, A: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        """
        Greedy + line‑sweep with a max‑heap.
        """
        # 1️⃣  sort by starting index
        queries.sort()
        n, q = len(A), len(queries)

        # 2️⃣  max‑heap for ends of all "available" queries
        h = []                 # python's heapq is a min‑heap -> use negatives
        end_cnt = [0] * (n + 1)   # how many chosen queries finish after i
        used = 0
        pos = 0

        for i in range(n):
            # 3️⃣  release queries that have ended
            used -= end_cnt[i]

            # 4️⃣  add new queries that start now
            while pos < q and queries[pos][0] <= i:
                heapq.heappush(h, -queries[pos][1])   # store negative to simulate max‑heap
                pos += 1

            # 5️⃣  we need A[i] decrements at index i
            while used < A[i]:
                if not h or -h[0] < i:    # no usable query
                    return -1
                e = -heapq.heappop(h)      # pick farthest‑ending query
                end_cnt[e + 1] += 1
                used += 1

        # 6️⃣  remaining queries are the removable ones
        return len(h)
```

### 1.3  C++ Implementation

```cpp
//  ---------  LeetCode 2719 – Zero Array Transformation III  ---------
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxRemoval(vector<int>& A, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        int n = (int)A.size(), q = (int)queries.size();
        sort(queries.begin(), queries.end());          // sort by start l

        priority_queue<int> h;          // max‑heap of ends
        vector<int> endCnt(n + 1, 0);   // how many chosen queries finish after i
        int used = 0;                   // number of active queries
        int pos = 0;                    // index in queries[]

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // release finished queries
            used -= endCnt[i];

            // add new available queries
            while (pos < q && queries[pos][0] <= i) {
                h.push(queries[pos][1]);    // push end index
                ++pos;
            }

            // need A[i] decrements at position i
            while (used < A[i]) {
                if (h.empty() || h.top() < i)   // no usable query
                    return -1;
                int e = h.top(); h.pop();
                endCnt[e + 1]++;                // will stop affecting after e
                ++used;
            }
        }
        // All queries that were never chosen are removable
        return (int)h.size();
    }
};
```

All three codes run in **O((n + q) log q)** time and **O(n + q)** space, comfortably within the 1 s / 256 MB limits for the problem.

## 2.  Blog Article – “Zero Array Transformation III: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly”

> **Keywords** – LeetCode, Zero Array Transformation III, interview coding problem, greedy algorithm, priority queue, line sweep, Java, Python, C++, job interview, data structures, algorithm, job hunt, programming interview, data‑structures interview.

### 2.1  Introduction

If you’re hunting a software‑engineering role, one of the quickest ways to showcase your algorithmic chops is by tackling a *LeetCode* problem that blends data‑structures knowledge with greedy reasoning. **Zero Array Transformation III** is a perfect showcase: it’s a modern, interview‑friendly problem that requires a clean, optimal solution and offers a great conversation starter with your future employer.

---

### 2.2  Problem Statement (Re‑phrased)

> **Given**:
> - An array `nums` of length `n` (0‑indexed), each element `nums[i]` is a non‑negative integer.
> - A list of `q` queries. Each query is a pair `[l, r]` meaning “decrement all elements `nums[l] … nums[r]` by 1”.
> 
> **Task**: Find the maximum number of queries that can be removed while still being able to reduce every `nums[i]` to zero or below by applying *some* of the remaining queries (each query can be used at most once).  
> If it’s impossible to make every element zero, return `-1`.

**Constraints**  
- `1 ≤ n, q ≤ 5 · 10⁴`  
- `0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 5 · 10⁴`  
- `0 ≤ l ≤ r < n`  

---

### 2.3  Why This Problem Is Interview‑Friendly

1. **Overlaps & Greedy** – You have to decide *which* queries to use, and that decision depends on the *coverage* of each query.  
2. **Priority Queue Mastery** – Many candidates get stuck on “how to pick the right query” – a classic test of priority‑queue knowledge.  
3. **Line Sweep Intuition** – A neat combination of sweep‑line and greedy that looks clean in a white‑board setting.  
4. **Space & Time Trade‑off** – Solving it in `O((n+q) log q)` demonstrates an awareness of asymptotic performance.

---

### 2.4  Solution Overview

1. **Transform the problem** – Instead of searching for *extra* queries directly, we compute the *minimum* number of queries required to zero the array.  
   *Answer = `totalQueries – minimumUsedQueries`.*

2. **Line‑sweep from left to right**  
   - While walking through the array, we maintain:
     - `used` – the number of active queries that are currently covering position `i`.  
     - A max‑heap (`h`) holding the end indices of *all available* queries that start before or at `i`.  
   - At every index `i` we need exactly `nums[i]` decrements.  
   - If `used < nums[i]`, we greedily pick the query that ends farthest to the right (`h.top()`), because it keeps us “covered” for the longest possible stretch.  
   - When a chosen query ends, we record that it will stop covering the array *after* its end index, so we can later decrement `used`.

2. **Edge case handling** –  
   - If at any point the heap is empty or the farthest‑ending query’s end index is `< i`, the array can’t be zeroed → return `-1`.  

3. **Result extraction** – After the sweep, the heap holds all queries that were **never** chosen. Those are exactly the removable ones.

---

### 2.5  Step‑by‑Step Walk‑Through (Java Pseudocode)

```text
1. sort queries by l
2. h = max‑heap of ends
3. endCount = [0 … n]   // how many chosen queries finish after i
4. used = 0, pos = 0
5. for i in 0 … n-1:
       used -= endCount[i]            // release finished queries
       while pos < q && queries[pos].l <= i:
           h.push(queries[pos].r)     // new available query
           pos += 1
       while used < nums[i]:
           if h.isEmpty or h.peek() < i: return -1
           e = h.pop()                 // farthest‑ending query
           endCount[e+1] += 1          // it will stop after e
           used += 1
6. return totalQueries - used
```

The Java, Python and C++ code snippets in the first section implement this algorithm in a single pass.

### 2.6  The Good

|  | What’s awesome? |
|--|-----------------|
| **Optimal** – The greedy choice “pick the query that ends farthest” is provably optimal. |
| **Clarity** – A single loop, two simple data structures; you can draw the logic in under 30 seconds. |
| **Language‑agnostic** – Works equally well in Java, Python, and C++ – perfect for a *technical phone screen* where you can switch languages. |
| **Test‑ready** – Write `unittest`/`pytest`/`gtest` in minutes to show your solution passes all corner cases. |

---

### 2.7  The Bad

|  | Common pitfalls |
|--|-----------------|
| **Thinking “remove all but one query”** – Failing to realise we need the *minimum* set of queries. |
| **Linear scan + brute‑force selection** – O(`n·q`) solutions time‑out on the largest test cases. |
| **Wrong heap orientation** – Using a min‑heap where a max‑heap is required leads to “wrong” query selection and infinite loops. |
| **Ignoring end credits** – Forgetting to mark when a chosen query stops covering leads to double‑counting and incorrect results. |

---

### 2.8  The Ugly

> *“What if the array is gigantic? What if queries are too many? How do I handle edge cases?”*  

In real‑world interviews you might encounter:

- **Very high `nums[i]` values** – The greedy still works; you just need enough covering queries.  
- **Sparse coverage** – If many queries are short and the array has a huge value at some index, you’ll quickly hit the `-1` branch – a good moment to discuss “why it’s impossible”.  
- **Memory pressure** – A naïve vector of size `n·q` will explode. The `endCount` trick keeps memory linear.

---

### 2.9  How to Talk About It on a Call

1. **Sketch the sweep line** – Draw an index line, place all query intervals, and point out the “available” vs “chosen” intervals.  
2. **Explain the greedy rule** – “We always use the interval that extends the farthest because it keeps our options open for as long as possible.”  
3. **Mention the heap** – “Java’s `PriorityQueue` (max‑heap) is ideal; Python’s `heapq` with negated values works just as well.”  
4. **Show the math** – “Running time is `O((n+q) log q)` because each push/pop is `log q`. Memory is `O(n+q)` because we keep a simple counter array.”  
5. **Highlight test coverage** – “Edge case: all zeros → answer = `q`. Impossible case → `-1`.”  

---

### 2.10  TL;DR for Your Resume

> **Zero Array Transformation III**  
> • Greedy + sweep‑line + max‑heap  
> • `O((n+q) log q)` time, `O(n+q)` space  
> • Implemented in Java, Python, and C++ (ready for interview)

Add this to your portfolio, run it against the *Sample Test Cases* from LeetCode, and you’ll have a ready‑to‑share story that shows you can *read* an array, *think* about overlapping intervals, and *implement* an optimal solution—all within a single pass.

## 3.  Quick‑Start Checklist for Your Interview

1. **Read the problem statement** – underline “minimum number of queries required” vs “maximum removable”.  
2. **Sort queries by start index** – O(q log q).  
3. **Sweep from left to right** – Keep a counter of active queries.  
4. **Use a max‑heap** – Pick the farthest‑ending interval when you need more coverage.  
5. **Release finished queries** – Subtract from the active counter using `endCount[i]`.  
6. **Return `totalQueries – usedQueries`** – That is the answer you’re asked for.  

Happy coding, and good luck on your next interview! 🚀
