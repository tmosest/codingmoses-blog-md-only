        ## 🎯 LeetCode 3371 – Identify the Largest Outlier in an Array  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** Array, HashMap, Two‑Pointer, Greedy

### 1️⃣ Problem Overview

You are given an integer array `nums`.  
Exactly `n‑2` elements are *special numbers*.  
One of the remaining two elements is **the sum** of those special numbers,  
and the other is an *outlier* – a number that is neither a special number nor the sum element.

All three elements have distinct indices, but they may share the same value.

> **Goal:** Return the **largest** possible outlier that can exist in the array.

---

### 2️⃣ Key Observations

Let

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `S` | Set of special numbers (size `n‑2`) |
| `sumS` | Sum of all elements in `S` |
| `x` | The element that equals `sumS` |
| `o` | The outlier |
| `total` | Sum of all elements in the array |

From the definition we have:

```
total = sumS + x + o
```

But `x = sumS`, so

```
total = 2 * x + o
=> o = total - 2 * x
```

Thus, if we choose an element `x` as the *sum* element, the outlier is forced to be  
`total - 2 * x`.  
The only remaining check is whether this outlier actually appears in the array
at a different index.

---

### 3️⃣ Algorithm

1. **Pre‑compute** the total sum of the array.
2. Build a **frequency map** (`value → count`) of all numbers for O(1) existence checks.
3. For each element `x` in the array  
   * compute `o = total - 2 * x`.  
   * Verify that `o` exists in the map.  
     * If `o != x`, any count ≥ 1 is sufficient.  
     * If `o == x`, we need at least two occurrences (`count > 1`).
4. Keep the **maximum** valid outlier found.
5. Return that maximum.

---

### 4️⃣ Correctness Proof

We prove that the algorithm returns the largest possible outlier.

*Lemma 1:*  
If an element `x` is the sum element, then the outlier must be `o = total - 2 * x`.

*Proof.*  
By definition, `total = sumS + x + o` and `sumS = x`.  
Thus `total = 2x + o` → `o = total - 2x`. ∎

*Lemma 2:*  
For any candidate sum element `x`, the algorithm declares `o` valid iff there exists an index `j ≠ i` such that `nums[j] = o`.

*Proof.*  
The frequency map contains the exact count of each value.  
- If `o ≠ x`, any occurrence of `o` at a different index satisfies the requirement.  
- If `o = x`, we need a second occurrence to guarantee distinct indices; hence `count > 1`.  
Thus the algorithm’s check is both necessary and sufficient. ∎

*Theorem:*  
The algorithm outputs the maximum possible outlier.

*Proof.*  
Consider any valid configuration of the array.  
Let `x` be the chosen sum element.  
By Lemma&nbsp;1, the outlier is `o = total - 2x`.  
When the algorithm iterates over that `x`, it will compute exactly that `o` and, by Lemma&nbsp;2, will deem it valid.  
Thus the algorithm considers **every** feasible outlier.  
It keeps the maximum of all valid `o`, so the returned value equals the largest possible outlier. ∎

### 5️⃣ Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Sum & map construction | **O(n)** | **O(n)** |
| Iterating over all elements | **O(n)** | — |
| **Total** | **O(n)** | **O(n)** |

`n ≤ 10⁵`, so this easily fits within limits.

---

### 6️⃣ Edge Cases

| Case | Reason | Algorithm Handles |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| Duplicate values for sum and outlier | Indices must differ | Counts checked (`>1` when values equal) |
| Negative numbers | Sum calculation works normally | No special handling needed |
| All elements identical | Only possible when value appears ≥ 3 times | Map counts ensure validity |
| Outlier is negative | Maximum among negatives still chosen | Standard max comparison |

## 📄 Code Implementations

### Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int getLargestOutlier(int[] nums) {
        int total = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();

        for (int num : nums) {
            total += num;
            freq.put(num, freq.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }

        int best = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int num : nums) {
            int candidateSum = num;
            int outlier = total - 2 * candidateSum;

            Integer count = freq.get(outlier);
            if (count == null) continue;

            if (outlier == candidateSum) {
                if (count > 1) best = Math.max(best, outlier);
            } else {
                best = Math.max(best, outlier);
            }
        }
        return best;
    }
}
```

---

### Python 3

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def getLargestOutlier(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        total = sum(nums)
        freq = Counter(nums)

        best = float('-inf')

        for x in nums:
            outlier = total - 2 * x
            cnt = freq.get(outlier, 0)

            if outlier == x:
                if cnt > 1:
                    best = max(best, outlier)
            else:
                if cnt:
                    best = max(best, outlier)

        return best
```

---

### C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int getLargestOutlier(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long total = 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        for (int v : nums) {
            total += v;
            ++freq[v];
        }

        int best = INT_MIN;
        for (int x : nums) {
            int outlier = static_cast<int>(total - 2LL * x);
            auto it = freq.find(outlier);
            if (it == freq.end()) continue;

            if (outlier == x) {
                if (it->second > 1) best = max(best, outlier);
            } else {
                best = max(best, outlier);
            }
        }
        return best;
    }
};
```

All three solutions run in **O(n)** time and use **O(n)** additional space.

### 1️⃣ Introduction

When you’re preparing for a technical interview, you’ll inevitably stumble across *array puzzles* that seem to test your creativity more than your coding skill. LeetCode 3371 – *Identify the Largest Outlier in an Array* – is one such challenge. It sounds simple at first glance, but it hides a subtle twist that can trip even seasoned developers.

In this post, we’ll dissect the problem, walk through the “good” straightforward approach, point out the “bad” pitfalls that can trip you up, and reveal the “ugly” edge cases you should never ignore. Finally, we’ll share a polished, production‑ready solution in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.

---

### 2️⃣ The Problem in Plain English

You’re given an array `nums` that contains `n` integers.  
Exactly `n‑2` of these numbers are *special*.  

- One of the remaining two numbers equals the **sum** of all the special numbers.  
- The other number is the **outlier** – it is neither a special number nor the sum.

All indices are distinct, but the same value may appear more than once.

**Task:** Find the *largest* possible outlier.

---

### 3️⃣ The “Good” – A Clean, O(n) Solution

The key insight:  
If we pick an element `x` to be the sum of all specials, the outlier is forced to be `total – 2*x`.  
We only need to check whether that computed value actually exists elsewhere in the array.

```text
for each x in nums:
    o = total - 2 * x
    if o exists in array and indices differ:
        candidate = max(candidate, o)
```

Because we pre‑compute the total sum and a frequency map, each check runs in O(1).  
So the whole algorithm is O(n) time, O(n) space.

---

### 4️⃣ The “Bad” – Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Why It Happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **O(n²) brute force** – Enumerating all pairs of specials | Thinking we need to test each pair | Use the algebraic relation above to avoid pair enumeration |
| **Not handling duplicates** – assuming values are unique | Overlooking that `x` and the outlier can share a value | Keep a frequency counter and check counts (needs ≥ 2 when equal) |
| **Ignoring negative numbers** | Assuming sums are always positive | The arithmetic works for negative values too |
| **Assuming the array has only two “special” values** | Misreading “n‑2 special numbers” | Remember that there can be many specials, all but two are specials |

---

### 5️⃣ The “Ugly” – Edge Cases You Must Cover

1. **All numbers the same**  
   Example: `[5, 5, 5, 5]` – here the sum element and the outlier both equal `5`.  
   *Fix:* Ensure there are at least two occurrences of `5`.

2. **Negative sums**  
   Example: `[-2, -1, -3, -6, 4]` – the sum of specials is `-6`.  
   *Fix:* Arithmetic handles negatives naturally; just use 64‑bit integers if you worry about overflow.

3. **Large arrays** (`n = 10⁵`)  
   *Fix:* O(n) solution with simple hash map.

4. **Multiple valid outliers**  
   There may be several candidates.  
   *Fix:* Keep track of the maximum as we iterate.
