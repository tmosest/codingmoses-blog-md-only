### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Recap (From LeetCode)

> You‚Äôre given an integer array `nums`.  
> In one operation you can **remove the first three elements** from the array (if fewer than 3 remain, remove all).  
> An array is considered ‚Äúdistinct‚Äù if all of its elements are unique.  
> Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make the array distinct.  
> (An empty array is always distinct.)

**Constraints**

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| `1¬†‚â§¬†nums.length¬†‚â§¬†100` | `1¬†‚â§¬†nums[i]¬†‚â§¬†100` |

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ High‚ÄëLevel Insight

The only way to remove duplicates is by trimming from the *front*.  
Thus the problem reduces to:

> **Find the earliest index (looking from the back) where a duplicate appears.**  
> All elements up to that index must be removed, and each operation removes 3 elements from the front.  
> The number of operations is simply `ceil((i+1)/3)`.

Because `nums[i] ‚â§ 100`, a simple frequency array (size 101) is enough ‚Äì no hash map needed.

## üîß Code Solutions

Below are three implementations:

| Language | Approach | Time | Space |
|----------|----------|------|-------|
| **Java** | Greedy (O(n)) | O(n) | O(1) |
| **Python** | Greedy (O(n)) | O(n) | O(1) |
| **C++** | Greedy (O(n)) | O(n) | O(1) |

Feel free to copy‚Äëpaste the code into your IDE or LeetCode editor.

### 2.1 Java (Optimal Greedy)

```java
// Java 17
class Solution {
    public int minimumOperations(int[] nums) {
        // freq[0] is unused because nums[i] >= 1
        int[] freq = new int[101];
        // Scan from the back; first duplicate forces removals
        for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (++freq[nums[i]] > 1) {
                // (i + 3) / 3 == ceil((i+1)/3)
                return (i + 3) / 3;
            }
        }
        return 0; // already distinct
    }
}
```

> **Why it works**  
> We keep a frequency count while moving from right to left.  
> The first time we see a value that‚Äôs already seen, all elements up to that index must be removed.  
> Each operation trims 3 elements, so the number of operations is the ceiling of `(i+1)/3`.

### 2.2 Python (Optimal Greedy)

```python
# Python 3.10+
class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        freq = [0] * 101          # 1‚Äëbased values only
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            freq[nums[i]] += 1
            if freq[nums[i]] > 1:
                # ceil((i+1)/3) => (i + 3) // 3
                return (i + 3) // 3
        return 0
```

---

### 2.3 C++ (Optimal Greedy)

```cpp
// C++17
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> freq(101, 0);            // values 1..100
        for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (++freq[nums[i]] > 1) {
                // ceil((i+1)/3)
                return (i + 3) / 3;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
```

---

### 2.4 Brute‚ÄëForce (Simulation) ‚Äì For Learning

> **Useful to understand the problem but not optimal.**

```java
// Java ‚Äì O(n^2) simulation
class Solution {
    public int minimumOperations(int[] nums) {
        int ops = 0;
        int[] arr = nums.clone();
        while (true) {
            if (allDistinct(arr)) break;
            int toRemove = Math.min(3, arr.length);
            arr = Arrays.copyOfRange(arr, toRemove, arr.length);
            ops++;
        }
        return ops;
    }

    private boolean allDistinct(int[] a) {
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        for (int v : a) if (!seen.add(v)) return false;
        return true;
    }
}
```

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

If you‚Äôre prepping for a software engineering interview, you‚Äôll encounter variations of ‚Äúmake an array unique‚Äù problems. LeetCode 3396 adds a twist: you can only chop off the first three elements in each operation. The challenge is to **minimize** those operations.

In this article, we‚Äôll dissect the problem, walk through a greedy solution, and compare it to a brute‚Äëforce approach. We‚Äôll also show code in Java, Python, and C++, and give you interview‚Äëready explanations.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Breakdown

- **Goal**: Remove duplicates with the fewest ‚Äúremove‚Äëfirst‚Äëthree‚Äù operations.
- **Key Insight**: Removing from the front forces us to think in terms of *prefixes*.
- **Observation**: If you scan the array from right to left, the first time you hit a duplicate tells you exactly how many elements you have to delete.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The ‚ÄúGood‚Äù ‚Äì Optimal Greedy

| Step | What to Do | Why It‚Äôs Efficient |
|------|------------|--------------------|
| **1** | Scan from the back. | Each element that‚Äôs already been seen means it *must* be in the prefix that we delete. |
| **2** | Count frequencies in an array of size 101. | No hash map ‚Äì constant space due to constraints. |
| **3** | On the first duplicate, compute `ceil((i+1)/3)`. | Because every operation deletes 3 elements from the front. |

#### 3.1 Time & Space Complexity

- **Time**: `O(n)` ‚Äì single pass.  
- **Space**: `O(1)` ‚Äì only a 101‚Äëelement array.

These complexities are perfect for the interview: quick to explain and fast to run.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The ‚ÄúBad‚Äù ‚Äì Brute‚ÄëForce Simulation

The simulation approach mirrors what a na√Øve candidate might code first.

- **Algorithm**: While the array contains duplicates, remove the first 3 elements.  
- **Complexity**: `O(n^2)` worst‚Äëcase because we rebuild the array each time.  
- **Drawback**: Not scalable beyond the small constraints; will get a ‚ÄúTime Limit Exceeded‚Äù warning if the test suite is larger.

**Why Learn It?**  
Understanding why the simulation fails helps you spot the optimal greedy pattern during interviews.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ The ‚ÄúUgly‚Äù ‚Äì Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | How to Fix |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Forgetting that the **first operation** removes *exactly* 3 elements | Wrong ceiling calculation | Use `(i + 3) / 3` (Java/C++) or `(i + 3) // 3` (Python). |
| Using a hash map but forgetting the 1‚Äëbased range | Extra memory & possible index errors | With `nums[i] ‚â§ 100`, a simple array suffices. |
| Returning `i / 3 + 1` directly | Off‚Äëby‚Äëone bug when `i` is a multiple of 3 | Always compute `ceil((i+1)/3)` to be safe. |

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Interview‚ÄëReady Explanation

> **‚ÄúWhy does the greedy solution work?‚Äù**  
> We process from the back. The first duplicate we encounter *forces* us to remove everything up to that point. Each operation deletes 3 front elements, so the minimal operations is the *ceil* of the prefix length divided by 3.  
> Because `nums[i] ‚â§ 100`, we can keep a small frequency array, making the solution both fast and memory‚Äëlight.

> **Possible follow‚Äëup questions**  
> - *What if the operation removed 2 elements instead of 3?*  
>   ‚Üí Replace `ceil((i+1)/2)` with `(i + 2) / 2`.  
> - *What if we could remove any contiguous block?*  
>   ‚Üí The problem becomes a classic ‚Äúremove duplicates‚Äù DP, which is a different challenge.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Test‚ÄëDriven Development

Make sure you validate your solution with the following cases:

| `nums` | Expected Ops |
|--------|--------------|
| `[3,2,1,2,3]` | 1 |
| `[3,1,5,3,1,4,5]` | 3 |
| `[1,2,3]` | 0 |
| `[1,1,1,1,1]` | 2 |
| `[5,5,5,5,5,5,5]` | 3 |

Add unit tests in your favorite framework. For example, in Java:

```java
@Test
void test() {
    assertEquals(1, new Solution().minimumOperations(new int[]{3,2,1,2,3}));
}
```

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Takeaway & Interview Tips

- **Keep it simple**: A single pass from the back is enough.  
- **Explain your intuition**: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre forced to cut prefixes, so we only need to know where the first duplicate appears from the end.‚Äù  
- **Talk about constraints**: ‚ÄúBecause the values are ‚â§‚ÄØ100, an array of 101 counters is enough, which keeps the solution O(1) space.‚Äù  
- **Time Complexity**: Emphasize the linear time‚Äîcritical for large inputs.  
- **Edge Cases**: An already distinct array ‚Üí 0 ops. Empty array ‚Üí 0 ops.
