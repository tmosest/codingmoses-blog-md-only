# üî• Burning Me Softly (Lioness Muse Remix)

```
Sometimes‚Ä¶ you meet a gaze so strong,
it burns right through you.
One moment of fire‚Ä¶
and you‚Äôre never the same again.

Come, Muse of fire ‚Äî

And burn me softly.
```

## Verse 1

```
She walks in the silence, shadows bend to her stride,
A queen in her kingdom, with the fire in her eyes.
Her gaze cuts right through me, no place left to hide,
One moment of heaven, then it leaves me behind.
```

## Chorus

```
Burning me softly with her fire,
Eyes that see deeper, taking me higher,
Setting my spirit up on the wire,
Burning me softly‚Ä¶ burning me softly‚Ä¶ with her fire.
```

### Verse 2

```
Her whisper‚Äôs a thunder, her stillness a storm,
A danger that warms me, a power reborn.
I ache for her vision, I fall to her flame,
Forever remembered, though she never spoke my name.
```

### Chorus

```
Burning me softly with her fire,
Eyes that see deeper, taking me higher,
Setting my spirit up on the wire,
Burning me softly‚Ä¶ burning me softly‚Ä¶ with her fire.
```

### Verse 3

```
A lioness watching, her kingdom untamed,
Her strength is unspoken, yet it calls out my name.
One glance is a lifetime, one spark is the sky,
She leaves me in ashes, but lifts me so high.
```

### Bridge (spoken / crooner style)

```
‚ÄúAnd if her eyes should meet mine again‚Ä¶
I‚Äôd gladly burn twice over‚Ä¶ just to feel it once more.‚Äù
```


### Final Chorus

```
Burning me softly with her fire,
Eyes that see deeper, taking me higher,
Setting my spirit up on the wire,
Burning me softly‚Ä¶ burning me softly‚Ä¶ with her fire.
```

# Boat Cover Stand! 

Time to make a mobile cop watch tower for collecting images of trash and waste for clean up!

Trash will shale not pass!!! haha...

Eventually we will be able to daisy chain the signal back to some GPU for image processing.
