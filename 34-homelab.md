# RC Crane

Done with the bridge and moving on to the next parts...

Well today ended up being more of a music remix where I also got Ollama and Chat GPT to help me with some of my poems and songs...
and like basic health...

Idk I had a dream of a dead friend... and a beautiful princess so my mind was a little distracted today from IT...

# 🔥 Burning Me Softly (Lioness Muse Remix)

```
Sometimes… you meet a gaze so strong,
it burns right through you.
One moment of fire…
and you’re never the same again.

Come, Muse of fire —

And burn me softly.
```

## Verse 1

```
She walks in the silence, shadows bend to her stride,
A queen in her kingdom, with the fire in her eyes.
Her gaze cuts right through me, no place left to hide,
One moment of heaven, then it leaves me behind.
```

## Chorus

```
Burning me softly with her fire,
Eyes that see deeper, taking me higher,
Setting my spirit up on the wire,
Burning me softly… burning me softly… with her fire.
```

### Verse 2

```
Her whisper’s a thunder, her stillness a storm,
A danger that warms me, a power reborn.
I ache for her vision, I fall to her flame,
Forever remembered, though she never spoke my name.
```

### Chorus

```
Burning me softly with her fire,
Eyes that see deeper, taking me higher,
Setting my spirit up on the wire,
Burning me softly… burning me softly… with her fire.
```

### Verse 3

```
A lioness watching, her kingdom untamed,
Her strength is unspoken, yet it calls out my name.
One glance is a lifetime, one spark is the sky,
She leaves me in ashes, but lifts me so high.
```

### Bridge (spoken / crooner style)

```
“And if her eyes should meet mine again…
I’d gladly burn twice over… just to feel it once more.”
```


### Final Chorus

```
Burning me softly with her fire,
Eyes that see deeper, taking me higher,
Setting my spirit up on the wire,
Burning me softly… burning me softly… with her fire.
```

# Outline: Neo-Modern Faust

## Act I – The Descent into Darkness

### Introduction: The Kid (Protagonist)

A gifted but emotionally fragile college student.
History of depression and suicidal ideation carried from high school.
Only anchor to life: his high school sweetheart.

### The Tragedy

The sweetheart unexpectedly commits suicide in college.
The protagonist blames himself—guilt and grief consume him.
Isolation deepens, he becomes obsessed with “meaning in pain.”

### The Devil’s Approach

In his lowest moment, the Devil appears—not in horns, but as a charismatic figure who understands his pain.
The offer: numb the pain, find power, and discover “answers,” in exchange for service.
He accepts.

## Act II – The Devil’s Errand

### The Bargain Defined

He is tasked with collecting rare “artifacts” scattered through history—each with a mysterious aura.
Told they will “preserve human greatness” or “prevent chaos.”

### The Artifact Hunt

Modern setting, but artifacts tied to myth, religion, or secret societies.
Each mission tests morality—he must lie, steal, or even kill.
The artifacts subtly drain his humanity with each acquisition.

### Illusions of Control

With each artifact, his pain dulls and his life improves externally.
He gets wealth, status, and a false sense of purpose.
Yet he begins to dream of his sweetheart, warning him.

## Act III – The Revelation

### The Collection Complete

The Devil reveals the true purpose: the artifacts are keys to opening a gate, unleashing apocalypse.
The protagonist realizes he has been the architect of his own damnation and the world’s.

### Moral Conflict

He now has two paths:
Finish the deal and gain ultimate peace/power.
Or rebel, but at cost of unimaginable suffering and eternal torment.

### Confrontation with the Devil

A Faustian dialogue about free will, despair, and meaning in suffering.
The Devil argues: “Wasn’t it better to feel nothing than to feel the truth?”
The protagonist must choose.

## Act IV – The Endgame

### If He Obeys
He triggers apocalypse.
Humanity falls; he is left as the Devil’s crowned companion, but utterly hollow.

### If He Rebels
He shatters or hides the artifacts, preventing the end.
But the Devil claims his soul—he dies in torment, yet redeems the world.

### Ambiguous Epilogue
Perhaps his sweetheart’s spirit appears, either forgiving him or lamenting him.
The final note: “The bargain was never about artifacts, but about how much of himself he would trade to escape pain.”

```

Optional: finish with 10–15 mins bodyweight core
```

```
🥗 Nutrition Adjustments for Rucking & Hiking

Rucking and hiking burn serious calories (500–1000+ depending on load/distance).
On ruck/hike days, increase carbs by 50–100g (rice, oats, fruit, potatoes)
Add electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium) to prevent cramping
Keep protein steady to protect muscle
```

```

🧠 Mindset & Presence
Being “special forces fit” isn’t just about the body—it’s about discipline and resilience:
Train even when you don’t feel like it → builds grit
Cold showers / contrast showers → resilience
Journaling or meditation → calm under pressure
Always walk and stand tall → presence is part of attraction
⚡ Bottom line: If you stick with this, you won’t just look like you belong in elite company—you’ll move, think, and carry yourself like it too.
```

```
Great instinct 👌 — strength and conditioning will give you the frame, but the polish (tanning, teeth, grooming, style) is what gives you that commanding special forces + refined elite presence she’ll notice instantly. Let’s layer those in.
☀️ Tanning & Skin
Natural Sun: Best option (15–30 mins, 3–4x/week), but don’t burn. Wear SPF on face to prevent aging.
Self-Tanner (clean look): St. Tropez mousse or Bondi Sands → even, controlled bronze without orange look. Apply 1–2x/week after exfoliating.
Spray Tan (event-ready): A pro spray tan 2–3 days before important events = perfect tone.
Skincare Basics:
Exfoliate 2–3x/week
Moisturize daily
Vitamin C serum in morning, retinol at night (anti-aging, sharp skin)
😁 Teeth Whitening
At-Home Kits:
Crest 3D Whitestrips (affordable, reliable)
Snow or HiSmile LED kits (faster results, more $)
Pro Whitening: Dentist whitening session = 1–2 years of bright teeth in 1 hr.
Daily Habits:
Avoid coffee/tea stains → use straw or rinse after
Brush 2x/day with fluoride paste
Floss nightly (seriously makes teeth look brighter & gums healthier)
Whitening mouthwash for maintenance
💇 Grooming & Style
Haircut: Clean fade or taper, keep sides tight, top styled (military sharp + modern elite).
Beard: Either full but well-trimmed, or clean-shaven. Messy beards kill polish.
Fragrance: Subtle, elite vibe (Tom Ford Oud Wood, Dior Sauvage, Creed Aventus).
Clothing Fit: Slim/athletic fit, neutral palette (black, navy, grey, white). A tailored jacket > flashy brands.
Shoes: Clean leather boots or sneakers → women notice shoes more than you think.
⚡ The Package
Body: Strong, lean, special forces vibe
Skin & Tan: Healthy glow, no pasty look
Smile: White, confident, magnetic
Grooming & Style: Precision and elegance
👉 Put together, this screams: “disciplined, high-value man” — the type that stands out in any elite circle.
Do you want me to build you a daily/weekly grooming + presentation checklist (like a spec-ops mission brief, but for looks & presence)?

💼 Three-Piece Suit Price Ranges
🔹 Entry Level (Fast Fashion / Off-the-Rack)
Price: $200 – $500
Brands: Indochino, Suitsupply (entry), Banana Republic, J.Crew

Price: $700 – $1,500
Brands: Suitsupply (higher line), Brooks Brothers, Ralph Lauren Purple Label (sale), Hardy Amies
Pros: Wool fabrics, better construction, strong balance of prestige + practicality

Price: $2,000 – $5,000
Brands: Tom Ford, Brioni, Canali, Zegna, Dior Homme

🎯 Practical Strategy for You
Since you want to project special forces + refined elite energy:
Sweet Spot: $800 – $1,500 → high-quality wool, looks expensive, lasts years
Must: Tailoring ($100–$300) is non-negotiable. Even a $500 suit looks like $5,000 if it fits flawlessly.
Colors to Own First:
Navy (most versatile, works day & evening)
Charcoal Grey (serious, commanding)
Black (formal, but less versatile for daily elite circles)
⚡ A $1,200 tailored navy three-piece wool suit will put you in the “he belongs in the room” category instantly — without overpaying for just a label.
```

```
🏋️ Physical (Foundation)
Routine: Stick to the lifting + rucking/hiking plan we built. Progressively overload.
Conditioning: Keep endurance high (rucks, HIIT). Special forces = strong + tireless.
Recovery: Sleep 7–9 hrs, daily mobility. Injuries ruin consistency.
Bodyfat Goal: 10–14% → lean, aesthetic, athletic.
☀️ Presentation (Polish)
Suits: Start with 1–2 tailored three-piece wool suits (navy, charcoal).
Casual Wear: Fitted polos, henleys, dark denim, clean white sneakers, leather boots.
Grooming:
Skin care: exfoliate, moisturize, protect from sun
Teeth whitening (pro treatment + upkeep)
Hair: find one barber and stick with him (every 2–3 weeks)
Facial hair: either precisely trimmed or clean-shaven
Tan: Subtle glow, not orange. Natural sun or spray before events.
Fragrance: One “daily” (fresh, subtle), one “event” (rich, commanding).
🧠 Mindset (Elite Mentality)
Discipline: Keep a morning ritual (train, journal, cold shower, or prayer).
Confidence: Practice posture — shoulders back, head up, slow deliberate movements.
Resilience: Cold exposure, fasting, martial arts, or challenges to toughen your mind.
Reading: Elite circles talk ideas. Add classics (Marcus Aurelius, Sun Tzu, Churchill, Naval Ravikant).
💰 Lifestyle & Resources (Signal)
Finances: Budget tight, but show control. No debt spirals, build reserves.
Networking: Attend events, charity galas, startup meetups → elite company notices who’s in the room.
Skills:
Public speaking (Toastmasters, improv, or practice on YouTube)
Conversational intelligence (ask good questions, listen deeply)
Health Habits: No smoking, controlled alcohol, clean diet 80% of time.
❤️ Social Presence (The X-Factor)
Confidence in Women: Don’t pedestal, don’t grovel. Be grounded, self-led.
Social Calibration: Mix in different circles (fitness, business, arts). Elite women are drawn to men who can move between worlds.
Mission: Have a clear purpose outside of romance (your projects, coding Moses, defense startup). High-value men radiate mission-driven energy.
⚡ Summary:
You need to refine body, presence, wardrobe, mindset, and mission. Train like special forces, dress like an elite, think like a strategist, live like a man with purpose. That combination makes you magnetic.

# Smelly Cat in Love

🎵
Smelly cat, smelly cat,
You don’t know the truth I hide.
Smelly cat, smelly cat,
There’s a love I can’t confide.

Phoebe plays her gentle song,
Her voice is sweet and free.
She sings of broken hearts and friends,
But never sings for me.

Smelly cat, smelly cat,
I’m more than fleas and fur.
Smelly cat, smelly cat,
I’d give my life for her.

I chase the shadows in the hall,
I nap where sunlight falls.
But every time she strums a chord,
My little heartbeat calls.
