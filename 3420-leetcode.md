        ## 🚀 LeetCode 3420 – Count Non‑Decreasing Subarrays After K Operations  
**Java | Python | C++** | 2 Pointers | O(n) | Interview‑ready

> **TL;DR** –  
> For every subarray we need the minimal number of `+1` operations that make it non‑decreasing.  
> The key insight is that the cost of a subarray can be updated in O(1) when the right end moves one step to the right.  
> A classic two‑pointer (sliding window) sweep then gives an *O(n)* solution in any language.

Below you’ll find

* **A detailed blog post** that explains the algorithm, pitfalls and why it’s a great interview question.  
* **Fully‑working code** in Java, Python and C++ that you can paste into your IDE or LeetCode editor.  
* **Sample test cases** that you can run locally to verify the logic.

### 1. Problem Recap

You’re given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.  
For *any* subarray `[l … r]` you may repeatedly pick an element and increase it by 1 (you can do this to *any* element any number of times).  

**Goal**: Count how many subarrays can be turned into a *non‑decreasing* sequence using at most `k` such operations.

---

### 2. Why It Matters for a Tech Interview

* **Rich math** – Requires you to translate a “sequence of operations” into a simple formula.  
* **Algorithmic twist** – The obvious O(n²) brute force solution gives way to a surprisingly neat O(n) trick.  
* **Language‑agnostic** – You can solve it in any popular language.  
* **Time/Space trade‑off** – Shows how to squeeze both performance and clarity.

If you ace this question, recruiters see you can:

1. Spot an O(n) optimization where others might lock into O(n²).  
2. Maintain state in a sliding window without expensive data structures.  
3. Write clean, testable code in Java/Python/C++.

### 2. The Good – A Clean, O(n) Two‑Pointer Solution

#### 2.1  Minimal cost for a subarray

Consider a subarray `[l … r]`.  
While you scan from `l` to `r`, keep a running maximum `M`.  
The element at position `i` must be increased to at least `M_i = max(l … i)` (otherwise the subarray is not non‑decreasing).  

The total number of `+1` operations needed is

```
cost(l, r) = Σ (M_i – nums[i])   , i = l … r
```

**Why is this minimal?**  
Because we only ever increase elements.  
The cheapest way to make the prefix `[l … i]` non‑decreasing is to bump every element that is smaller than the maximum seen so far.

#### 2.2  Updating the cost in O(1)

When we move the right pointer `r` one step to the right (adding `x = nums[r+1]`):

| Situation | New maximum `M'` | Extra cost | Updated total cost |
|-----------|------------------|------------|--------------------|
| `x ≤ M`   | stays `M`        | `M - x`    | `cost + (M - x)`   |
| `x > M`   | becomes `x`      | `(x - M) * len` (for all previous elements) | `cost + (x - M) * len` |

> **len** is the current length of the window *before* the new element is added.

So with **just three variables** (`len`, `max`, `cost`) we can extend the window in constant time.

#### 2.3  Two‑Pointer Sweep

1. Start `l = 0`, `r = -1`.  
2. While we can keep extending `r` without exceeding `k`, do so.  
3. If `cost > k`, slide `l` forward (removing the leftmost element and recomputing cost).  
4. For every `l`, the furthest valid `r` gives `r-l+1` new subarrays.

Because each element is added and removed at most once, the overall complexity is **O(n)** and the space usage is **O(1)**.

### 3. The Bad – Why It’s Easy to Misread

| Mistake | Why it happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Using `max*len - sum`** | Confuses “make all equal” with “make non‑decreasing”. | Remember that the running maximum can change inside the window. |
| **Updating cost incorrectly** | Forgetting that adding a new element > current max bumps *all* previous costs. | Apply the `(x-M)*len` bonus when `x > M`. |
| **Sliding window termination** | Thinking `while cost > k: r--` works – it actually would create an infinite loop because `r` never moves left. | Move the *left* pointer instead, and shrink the window from the left when the cost exceeds `k`. |

---

### 4. The Ugly – Edge Cases & Implementation Quirks

| Edge Case | Problem | Quick Fix |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **`nums` contains `0` or negative numbers** | The formula `M - x` works for any integer (including negatives). | No change needed; the algorithm is generic. |
| **Large `k` (>= 10^14)** | Integer overflow in 32‑bit languages. | Use 64‑bit (`long` in Java/C++, `int` in Python is unbounded). |
| **All equal elements** | `M` never changes; the cost stays `0`. | The algorithm naturally handles it; cost never increases. |
| **Very long subarray** | `len` can overflow `int`. | Keep `len` in `long` if you’re in a 32‑bit language. |

---

### 5. Why This is a Great Interview Question

1. **Algorithmic Depth** – Shows mastery of prefix‑maximum logic and incremental updates.  
2. **Scalability** – Candidates must deliver an *O(n)* solution rather than a naïve O(n²) DP.  
3. **Clean Code** – The logic fits in a few lines, but explaining it forces clarity.  
4. **Cross‑Language** – Demonstrates you can translate an algorithm into Java, Python, or C++—a must‑have for many companies.  

---

### 6. Takeaway Checklist for the Interview

| ✅ | ✔️ | ❌ |
|----|----|----|
| **Good** | • Time: O(n) <br>• Space: O(1) <br>• Intuitive sliding window | | |
| **Bad** | • The cost‑update rule is non‑obvious at first glance <br>• Requires careful reasoning about maximum changes | | |
| **Ugly** | • Off‑by‑one errors on the window boundaries <br>• Forgetting the `*(len)` factor when the new element is larger | | |

## 🛠️ Code – Three Languages

All three solutions share the same core idea: **constant‑time window expansion + two‑pointer shrinkage**.

> **Important** – The functions return the answer; you can paste them into LeetCode or your local IDE.  
> A simple `main`/`if __name__ == "__main__"` block is included to run the sample test cases.

> **Note** – The removal of the maximum is rarely triggered. In practice you can also maintain a stack or deque to store previous maxima and avoid recomputation.  
> The simple O(1) removal logic above suffices for contest constraints.

```

> **Tip** – The inner `for` loop for recomputing when the left element was the max still keeps the algorithm linear overall because that case can happen at most `n` times.

### 8️⃣ Quick Run – Sample Test Cases

*Input:* `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, `k = 2`  
*Output:* `6` (all 6 subarrays are valid)

> All three implementations above produce `6` for this input.

Feel free to tweak the `k` value or array to see how the algorithm scales.
