        ## 1.  Problem Overview  

**LeetCode 3424 – Minimum Cost to Make Arrays Identical**  
- **Difficulty:** Medium  
- **Type:** Array transformation + greedy + sorting  

You are given two integer arrays `arr` and `brr` of equal length `n` and an integer `k`.  
You can perform two kinds of operations on **`arr`** any number of times:

| Operation | Effect | Cost |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Split `arr` into any number of contiguous sub‑arrays and reorder those sub‑arrays arbitrarily. | Reorders the *whole* array, ignoring the original order of the elements. | `k` |
| Pick a single element and add or subtract a positive integer `x`. | Changes the value of that element by `x`. | `x` |

The goal is to transform `arr` so that it becomes exactly equal to `brr` while minimizing the total cost.

> **Examples**  
> *Example 1*  
> `arr = [-7,9,5]`, `brr = [7,-2,-5]`, `k = 2` → Minimum cost `13`.  
> *Example 2*  
> `arr = [2,1]`, `brr = [2,1]`, `k = 0` → Minimum cost `0`.  

---

## 2.  Intuition  

There are only two meaningful strategies:

1. **Never use the “reorder” operation**  
   * The array stays in its original order.  
   * The only work left is to adjust each element individually.  
   * The cost is simply the sum of absolute differences of the two arrays in the given order.

2. **Use the “reorder” operation exactly once**  
   * After paying `k`, we can arrange the elements of `arr` arbitrarily.  
   * The cheapest way to match `arr` to `brr` after reordering is to sort both arrays and pair the smallest values together, then the second smallest, and so on.  
   * The cost of adjustments is then the sum of absolute differences of the sorted arrays.  
   * Total cost = `k + Σ|sorted(arr)[i] – sorted(brr)[i]|`.

No other strategy can be cheaper because:
- The reorder operation can be used at most once (doing it twice is strictly worse – you would pay `2k` but you could have reordered just once).
- After a reorder, the best matching is sorting – any other matching would pair “mismatched” values and lead to a larger adjustment cost.

So the answer is simply the **minimum** of the two costs above.

## 3.  Algorithm & Complexity  

```
cost1 = Σ |arr[i] - brr[i]|          // keep original order
sort(arr)
sort(brr)
cost2 = Σ |arr[i] - brr[i]| + k       // use reorder once
answer = min(cost1, cost2)
```

* **Time Complexity**:  
  - Sorting: `O(n log n)`  
  - Linear scans: `O(n)`  
  - Overall: `O(n log n)`

* **Space Complexity**:  
  - In-place sorting keeps the arrays themselves.  
  - Extra variables are `O(1)`.  

---

## 4.  Edge Cases & Validation  

| Case | Why it matters | What the algorithm returns |
|------|----------------|----------------------------|
| `k = 0` | Reorder is free | The algorithm automatically picks `min(cost1, cost2)`; if sorting gives lower cost it will be chosen. |
| `arr == brr` | Already identical | `cost1 = 0`, `cost2 = k`. Returns `0`. |
| Negative numbers | Subtractions/additions may become negative | `Math.abs` handles this, no overflow with 64‑bit integers. |
| `n = 1` | Only one element | Works the same: either change it or reorder (same effect). |

---

## 5.  Reference Implementations  

Below are clean, production‑ready implementations for **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.

> **Important** – All use 64‑bit integers (`long` / `long long`) because the cost can reach `2×10¹⁰` + `10⁵ × 10⁵` > `2²³`.

### 5.1 Java (LeetCode style)

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public long minCost(int[] arr, int[] brr, long k) {
        long costOriginal = 0L;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            costOriginal += Math.abs((long)arr[i] - (long)brr[i]);
        }

        // Sort copies to avoid mutating the input (optional)
        int[] aSorted = arr.clone();
        int[] bSorted = brr.clone();
        Arrays.sort(aSorted);
        Arrays.sort(bSorted);

        long costReordered = 0L;
        for (int i = 0; i < aSorted.length; i++) {
            costReordered += Math.abs((long)aSorted[i] - (long)bSorted[i]);
        }
        costReordered += k; // pay once for the reordering

        return Math.min(costOriginal, costReordered);
    }
}
```

---

### 5.2 Python (LeetCode style)

```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, arr: list[int], brr: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Cost without reordering
        cost_original = sum(abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(arr, brr))

        # Cost with one reordering
        sorted_a = sorted(arr)
        sorted_b = sorted(brr)
        cost_reordered = sum(abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(sorted_a, sorted_b)) + k

        return min(cost_original, cost_reordered)
```

---

### 5.3 C++ (LeetCode style)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long minCost(vector<int>& arr, vector<int>& brr, long long k) {
        long long costOriginal = 0;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i)
            costOriginal += llabs((long long)arr[i] - (long long)brr[i]);

        vector<int> aSorted = arr;
        vector<int> bSorted = brr;
        sort(aSorted.begin(), aSorted.end());
        sort(bSorted.begin(), bSorted.end());

        long long costReordered = 0;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < aSorted.size(); ++i)
            costReordered += llabs((long long)aSorted[i] - (long long)bSorted[i]);

        costReordered += k;            // pay once for the reorder
        return min(costOriginal, costReordered);
    }
};
```

### 6.1 Introduction  

If you’re preparing for coding interviews, you’ll soon realize that **array transformation problems** are a recurring theme. One of the newest challenges is **LeetCode 3424 – Minimum Cost to Make Arrays Identical**. On the surface, it looks like a classic “adjust values” problem, but the twist—splitting the array into sub‑segments and reordering them—adds a layer of strategy that can trip up even seasoned coders.

In this article, we’ll dissect the problem, reveal the *good* (the elegant greedy solution), point out the *bad* (common pitfalls), and expose the *ugly* (over‑engineered approaches that waste time). By the end, you’ll have a concise, battle‑tested implementation in **Java, Python, and C++**, plus a cheat‑sheet of interview‑ready takeaways.

---

### 6.2 Problem Recap  

| Input | Operation | Cost |
|-------|-----------|------|
| `arr`, `brr`, `k` | Split `arr` into any number of contiguous sub‑arrays and reorder them | `k` |
| Change a single element by `±x` | | `x` |

Goal: Make `arr` exactly equal to `brr` at minimal total cost.

**Constraints**  
- `n` up to `10⁵`  
- `k` up to `2×10¹⁰`  
- Element values between `-10⁵` and `10⁵`

---

### 6.3 The Good – The Greedy Sorting Trick  

The optimal strategy boils down to **two simple options**:

1. **Never reorder**  
   Adjust each element in place.  
   Cost = `Σ|arr[i] – brr[i]|`.

2. **Reorder once**  
   After paying `k`, we can permute `arr` arbitrarily.  
   The cheapest matching after a reorder is to **sort both arrays** and pair them.  
   Cost = `k + Σ|sorted(arr)[i] – sorted(brr)[i]|`.

The final answer is `min(cost1, cost2)`.  
Why sorting?  
- The *reorder* operation breaks the original order, so the only thing that matters is **the multiset of values**.  
- Pairing smallest with smallest is a classic greedy principle that guarantees the minimal sum of absolute differences (think “rearrangement inequality”).

This solution is **O(n log n)** due to the sort, and uses only a few extra variables. It’s both *fast* and *simple* – perfect for interview scenarios where time is limited.

---

### 6.4 The Bad – Common Mistakes  

| Mistake | What happened | How to avoid it |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Treating reorder as “any number of times”** | Someone might try to sort multiple times or apply partial reorders, which is never cheaper than a single reorder. | Recognize that `k` is a one‑time cost; extra reorders add unnecessary `k`. |
| **Ignoring 64‑bit overflow** | Using `int` for cost calculations can overflow when `k` and element differences are large. | Use `long` (`Java`) / `long long` (`C++`) / Python’s built‑in big integers. |
| **Sorting in place without copying** | The LeetCode test harness might use the original arrays for subsequent test cases. | Clone the arrays before sorting, or sort copies (`aSorted = arr.clone()` in Java). |
| **Assuming sub‑array splits change values** | Splitting only reorders; it doesn’t modify element values. | Remember the only value‑changing operation is the ±x adjustment. |

---

### 6.5 The Ugly – Over‑Engineered Attempts  

Some candidates attempt to *enumerate* all possible reorder counts or use sophisticated data structures (segment trees, multiset unions) to simulate sub‑array moves. While technically correct, these solutions:

- Run **O(n²)** or higher, failing the time limit for `n = 10⁵`.  
- Consume **excessive memory** (e.g., building all possible permutations).  
- Make the code hard to debug and verify.

In an interview, **simplicity wins**. Stick to the greedy sorting logic and keep the implementation concise. If you’re stuck, ask the interviewer: “Do you want me to reorder multiple times?” – it’ll give you a hint that a single reorder is enough.

---

### 6.6 Interview‑Ready Takeaways  

| Topic | What to mention |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Rearrangement Inequality** | Sorting after a reorder is the minimal matching. |
| **Reordering vs. Adjustment** | Pay `k` only once; adjusting values is independent of order. |
| **Time vs. Space** | `O(n log n)` is acceptable; in-place sorts keep space low. |
| **Data Types** | Always promote to 64‑bit for cost calculations. |
| **Edge‑Case Handling** | Show you considered `k = 0`, already‑equal arrays, and single‑element scenarios. |

---

### 6.6 Sample Code – Fast & Readable  

> **Java**  

```java
public long minCost(int[] arr, int[] brr, long k) {
    long costOriginal = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        costOriginal += Math.abs((long)arr[i] - brr[i]);
    }

    int[] a = arr.clone();   // do not modify input
    int[] b = brr.clone();
    Arrays.sort(a);
    Arrays.sort(b);

    long costReordered = k;
    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        costReordered += Math.abs((long)a[i] - b[i]);
    }

    return Math.min(costOriginal, costReordered);
}
```

> **Python**  

```python
def minCost(arr, brr, k):
    cost1 = sum(abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(arr, brr))
    cost2 = sum(abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(sorted(arr), sorted(brr))) + k
    return min(cost1, cost2)
```

> **C++**  

```cpp
long long minCost(vector<int>& arr, vector<int>& brr, long long k) {
    long long cost1 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i)
        cost1 += llabs((long long)arr[i] - brr[i]);

    vector<int> a = arr, b = brr;
    sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    sort(b.begin(), b.end());

    long long cost2 = k;
    for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); ++i)
        cost2 += llabs((long long)a[i] - b[i]);

    return min(cost1, cost2);
}
```

### 6.7 Final Thoughts  

LeetCode 3424 is a **great test of pattern recognition**. The key realization is that the *reorder* operation obliterates order, reducing the problem to a multiset comparison. The sorting‑greedy solution is the *good* you’ll want to bring to every interview.

Avoid the *bad* pitfalls by paying attention to data types and one‑time costs. And if you ever find yourself drafting a complicated segment‑tree solution, remember: **Simplicity wins**.

Happy coding—and good luck with your next interview!
