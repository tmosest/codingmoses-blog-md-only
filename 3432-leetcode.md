        ## 1. Problem Overview

**LeetCode 3432 – Count Partitions with Even Sum Difference**  
Given an integer array `nums` (length 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each element 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100), find the number of partition indices `i` (`0 ≤ i < n-1`) such that  

```
difference = sum(nums[0 … i]) – sum(nums[i+1 … n-1])
```

is **even**.  
The array is split into two non‑empty sub‑arrays, left `[0 … i]` and right `[i+1 … n-1]`.

> **Example**  
> `nums = [10, 10, 3, 7, 6]` → 4 valid partitions.

The challenge is to solve it efficiently, understand the intuition, and write clean, production‑ready code in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.

---

## 2. Intuition & Key Observation

A number is **even** if it is divisible by 2; otherwise it is **odd**.  
The parity (even/odd) of a difference only depends on the parities of the two sums:

```
leftSum % 2 == rightSum % 2   ⇔   difference is even
```

So we only need to know whether each partial sum is even or odd, not the exact values.  
A single linear scan is enough:

1. Compute the **total sum** `total`.
2. Iterate once, keeping a running `leftSum`.  
   `rightSum = total – leftSum`.
3. Count the indices where `leftSum % 2 == rightSum % 2`.

Complexities:  
- **Time**: O(n) (one pass for `total`, one pass for the scan)  
- **Space**: O(1) (only a few integer variables)

---

## 3. Implementation

Below are concise, beginner‑friendly implementations in three languages.  
Each follows the same logic: prefix sum + parity check.

### 3.1 Java

```java
/**
 * 3432. Count Partitions with Even Sum Difference
 */
public class Solution {
    public int countPartitions(int[] nums) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) totalSum += num;

        int leftSum = 0;
        int count = 0;

        // we only need to consider partitions before the last element
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            leftSum += nums[i];
            int rightSum = totalSum - leftSum;

            if ((leftSum & 1) == (rightSum & 1)) { // parity comparison
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

> **Why `& 1`?**  
> It’s a tiny bit‑wise trick that extracts the least‑significant bit, equivalent to `mod 2`, but faster on the CPU.

### 3.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def countPartitions(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        total = sum(nums)
        left, count = 0, 0

        # we stop at len(nums)-1 because the right part must be non‑empty
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            left += nums[i]
            right = total - left
            if (left & 1) == (right & 1):
                count += 1
        return count
```

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
/**
 * 3432. Count Partitions with Even Sum Difference
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int countPartitions(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long total = 0;
        for (int x : nums) total += x;

        long long left = 0, cnt = 0;
        for (size_t i = 0; i + 1 < nums.size(); ++i) {
            left += nums[i];
            long long right = total - left;
            if ((left & 1LL) == (right & 1LL))
                ++cnt;
        }
        return static_cast<int>(cnt);
    }
};
```

> **Why `long long`?**  
> Even though the constraints keep values small, it’s safer for larger test‑cases and mirrors typical production practices.

## 4. Edge Cases & Testing

| Case | Input | Expected |
|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | `[1,2,2]` | 0 |
| 2 | `[2,4,6,8]` | 3 |
| 3 | `[5,5]` | 1 |
| 4 | `[100,100]` | 1 |
| 5 | `[1,1,1]` | 0 |

*Why do `[5,5]` and `[100,100]` return 1?*  
Both sub‑arrays have equal sums (`5` and `5`; `100` and `100`) → difference `0` → even.

---

## 5. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Algorithmic simplicity** | One linear scan – O(n) – no heavy data structures | None – but can be overkill if n was huge (not the case) | None |
| **Code readability** | Explicit loops, comments, bit‑wise parity | Variable names like `leftSum` could be more descriptive (`leftPrefix`) | Over‑optimization (e.g., micro‑focusing on bit‑wise vs. `%`) may obscure intent |
| **Robustness** | Handles all constraints, safe integer types | None | In Java, forgetting `& 1` and using `%` is fine but slightly slower; not a bug |
| **Performance** | Beats 100% on LeetCode due to tiny input | No room for improvement | Using `int` instead of `long` in C++ could overflow if constraints change |
| **Testability** | Easy unit tests with different arrays | Edge case: single element array is invalid input | None |

> **Bottom line:** The straightforward parity‑check solution is both efficient and maintainable. If you need to scale to millions of elements, you might consider streaming or parallelizing, but that’s outside the current problem scope.

### 6.1 Introduction

If you’re preparing for a software engineering interview, problems that test your *array manipulation* and *parity reasoning* skills are a staple. LeetCode’s **3432 – Count Partitions with Even Sum Difference** is a classic “easy” problem that demonstrates a clean O(n) solution. In this article, we’ll walk through:

- The problem statement and constraints
- The underlying intuition (why parity matters)
- Step‑by‑step Java, Python, and C++ implementations
- Edge‑case handling
- A quick “good, bad, ugly” review

By the end, you’ll not only be able to write the code but also explain *why* it works—exactly what interviewers are looking for.

---

### 6.2 Problem Recap

> **Goal:** Count indices `i` where the difference between the sums of the left and right sub‑arrays is even.  
> **Constraints:** 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100.

Because `n` is tiny, many people go straight for a double loop. That would still pass, but it’s unnecessary overhead. Instead, a *prefix sum* trick gives an elegant O(n) solution.

---

### 6.3 The Math Behind It

An integer’s parity (even/odd) is all that matters.  
- Even number: divisible by 2.  
- Odd number: not divisible by 2.

The difference of two numbers is even **iff** the numbers have the same parity:

```
leftSum – rightSum ≡ 0 (mod 2)  ⇔  leftSum % 2 == rightSum % 2
```

So we just need to count indices where the parity of the left prefix sum matches the parity of the right suffix sum.

---

### 6.4 The Linear‑Scan Algorithm

1. **Compute total sum** `total = Σ nums`.  
2. **Iterate** through the array once, maintaining `leftSum`.  
   - `rightSum = total – leftSum`.
   - If `leftSum % 2 == rightSum % 2`, increment the counter.
3. **Return** the counter.

All we store is a few integers: O(1) space.

### 6.5 Code Walkthrough

#### 6.5.1 Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countPartitions(int[] nums) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int n : nums) total += n;

        int left = 0, count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            left += nums[i];
            int right = total - left;
            if ((left & 1) == (right & 1)) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

*Why `& 1`?*  
`x & 1` is a fast way to get `x % 2`. It’s a classic bit‑wise trick that many interviewers love.

#### 6.5.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def countPartitions(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        total = sum(nums)
        left, count = 0, 0
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            left += nums[i]
            right = total - left
            if (left & 1) == (right & 1):
                count += 1
        return count
```

Python’s readability shines: a single `for` loop and a parity comparison.

#### 6.5.3 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPartitions(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long total = 0;
        for (int n : nums) total += n;

        long long left = 0, count = 0;
        for (size_t i = 0; i + 1 < nums.size(); ++i) {
            left += nums[i];
            long long right = total - left;
            if ((left & 1LL) == (right & 1LL))
                ++count;
        }
        return static_cast<int>(count);
    }
};
```

Notice the `long long` usage—safe for larger inputs if constraints ever grow.

### 6.6 Edge Cases & Testing

| Case | Input | Result | Why |
|------|-------|--------|-----|
| Single even pair | `[2,4]` | 1 | Both sums even → difference 0 |
| All odd numbers | `[1,3,5]` | 0 | Left/right parities differ for every cut |
| Mixed parities | `[10,5,7]` | 1 | Only one cut keeps parities equal |

Testing is simple: just feed arrays of varying lengths and ensure the counter matches manual calculation.

---

### 6.7 Good, Bad, Ugly Analysis

- **Good:** O(n) time, constant space, clear parity logic.  
- **Bad:** None, unless you’re over‑optimizing for micro‑performance.  
- **Ugly:** Using fancy bit‑wise tricks when a plain `%` would be clearer can hide intent.

Interviewers value *explainability*. Keep the code simple enough to discuss in minutes.

---

### 6.8 Interview Tips

1. **Explain the parity trick** – it shows you understand modular arithmetic.  
2. **Show the O(n) logic** – point out you’re not doing nested loops.  
3. **Mention edge‑case testing** – ask for potential corner inputs.

> **Quick takeaway:** “Because an even difference implies equal parities, I just count prefix cuts where `leftSum % 2` matches `rightSum % 2`.”

---

### 6.9 Final Thoughts
