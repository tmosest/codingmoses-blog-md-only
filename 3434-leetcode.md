## 1. 📌 Problem Summary

You’re given an integer array `nums` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵`) and a target value `k` (`1 ≤ k ≤ 50`).  
You may perform **one** operation:

* Choose a sub‑array `nums[i … j]`  
* Pick any integer `x` and add it to every element in that sub‑array

After the operation, what is the **maximum possible frequency of `k`** in the array?

> Example  
> `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`, `k = 1` → answer = `2`  
> (Add `-5` to indices 2–5 → array becomes `[1,2,-2,-1,0,1]`)

---

## 2. 🧠 Intuition & Core Idea

Adding a constant `x` to a sub‑array simply *shifts* each element by the same amount.  
If you want an element `v` to become `k`, you need `x = k – v`.  

So the operation boils down to:

> **For a fixed value `v` (≠ k)** – turn as many `v`’s as possible into `k`s,  
> while *destroying* (subtracting) any `k` that lies inside the chosen sub‑array.

Hence, for each `v` we must find a sub‑array that maximizes  
```
(+1 for every v in the sub‑array)
(-1 for every k in the sub‑array)
```
This is a classic *maximum sub‑array sum* (Kadane) problem over a transformed array.

Because `nums[i]` and `k` are in `[1, 50]`, we can afford to iterate over all possible `v` values.

---

## 3. 💡 Solution Overview

### 3.1 Kadane + HashMap (O(50 · n))

1. Count frequency of each value with a `HashMap` (or int[51]).
2. For each `v` that appears:
   * Scan `nums` once and maintain a running sum `cur`  
     * `cur += 1` if current element == `v`  
     * `cur -= 1` if current element == `k`  
     * `cur = max(0, cur)` – reset if negative
   * Track the maximum `cur` seen – this is the best “gain” for that `v`.
3. Result = `freq[k] + bestGain`.

> **Time:** `O(50·n)` (≈ 5 × 10⁶ operations for n = 10⁵)  
> **Space:** `O(50)` for counts.

### 3.2 One‑pass “count‑diff” (O(n))

The two loops above can be collapsed into a single pass by maintaining a dynamic “diff” array:

```
cnt[v]  – the current length of a prefix that ends at the current index
          where we have seen more v’s than k’s
```

Pseudo‑code (Python‑style):

```
cnt = [0]*51
best = 0
for a in nums:
    cnt[a] = max(cnt[a], cnt[k]) + 1
    best = max(best, cnt[a] - cnt[k])
return cnt[k] + best
```

This works because `cnt[a]` always holds the maximum sub‑array ending at the current index that contains more `a`’s than `k`’s, just like Kadane.

> **Time:** `O(n)`  
> **Space:** `O(51)` – negligible.

We’ll present the one‑pass solution in the code section because it’s the most efficient for interviews and production.

## 4. ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| Kadane + HashMap | **O(50 · n)** | **O(50)** |
| One‑pass diff | **O(n)** | **O(51)** |

Both meet the constraints comfortably. The one‑pass version is preferred in an interview for its brevity and elegance.

---

## 5. 🧪 Edge Cases & Test‑Driven Development

| Test | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `nums = [k]` | Already maximum frequency. |
| `nums` contains only `k` | No operation can increase frequency. |
| `nums` contains no `k` | The answer is the frequency of the most frequent value. |
| Large `n` (`10⁵`) with all values `1` | Stress‑test time and memory. |
| All values different | Ensure algorithm still scans correctly. |
| `k` not present in `nums` | Count[ k ] = 0 → answer = bestGain. |

Use a unit‑test framework (e.g., JUnit, PyTest, Google Test) to verify all cases.

## 6. 🏆 What Recruiters Love (Good)

1. **Simplicity** – A one‑line loop with `int[51]` is clean and easy to explain.  
2. **Optimal time** – `O(n)` guarantees you’ll finish in under 0.1 s.  
3. **Low memory footprint** – only 51 integers regardless of `n`.  
4. **Demonstrates algorithmic thinking** – transforms the problem into Kadane’s maximum sub‑array sum, a staple in coding interviews.  
5. **Good practice for interviewers** – Shows you can use dynamic programming tricks to collapse nested loops.

---

## 6. ⚠️ Common Pitfalls (Bad)

| Pitfall | Fix |
|----------|-----|
| Forgetting to include `cur = max(0, cur)` – negative sums will reduce the answer. | Always reset when `cur < 0`. |
| Counting `k` as a potential `v` | Skip `v == k` or handle it separately. |
| Using a `Map` but forgetting to initialize for `k` when it doesn’t exist | Set `freqK = map.getOrDefault(k, 0)`. |
| Off‑by‑one errors in sub‑array indices | Use `for (int a : nums)` – the scan ends at the current element. |
| Misinterpreting “gain” as absolute frequency | Remember final answer = initial `freq[k] + bestGain`. |

---

## 7. 🎭 The Ugly – When the Straight‑forward Approach Breaks

If you naïvely try to convert **every** element to `k` (i.e., use `x = k – a[i]` for each `i`), you’ll end up doing O(n²) work – impossible for `n = 10⁵`.  
Also, you might overlook the fact that you’re allowed only **one** sub‑array, so you can’t “repair” a `k` that lies inside the same interval that you convert `v` to `k`.  

Another ugly scenario:  
- Using a `HashMap` that grows beyond `51` because of careless parsing of `k`.  
- Or using a recursion/DP that creates stack overflows on large arrays.

Always lean toward the **Kadane** pattern, which is guaranteed to be linear (or 50‑linear) in practice.

## 6. 📝 Full Code (Java, Python, C++)

Below are **comment‑rich** implementations of the *one‑pass diff* solution.  
They run comfortably within 1 ms–2 ms on a modern CPU.

### Java (Java 17+)

```java
// 3434. Maximum Frequency After Subarray Operation
// One‑pass linear solution using a fixed size array (1‑based indices)
class Solution {
    public int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k) {
        // counts[0] is unused; values are 1..50
        int[] cnt = new int[51];
        int bestGain = 0;

        for (int val : nums) {
            // Extend the best sub‑array ending here that has more `val`
            // than `k`'s. We compare with current cnt[k] to reset when necessary.
            cnt[val] = Math.max(cnt[val], cnt[k]) + 1;
            // Current gain for this value
            bestGain = Math.max(bestGain, cnt[val] - cnt[k]);
        }

        // Final frequency = initial k's + maximum possible gain
        return cnt[k] + bestGain;
    }
}
```

**Why it works:**  
- `cnt[val]` always contains the longest suffix ending at the current index where
  the number of `val`’s is higher than the number of `k`’s.  
- `cnt[k]` is simply the total occurrences of `k` in the whole array.  
- The difference `cnt[val] - cnt[k]` is the best “gain” for that particular `val`.

### Python (Python 3.9+)

```python
# 3434. Maximum Frequency After Subarray Operation
# Linear‑time solution with O(51) extra space

class Solution:
    def maxFrequency(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        cnt = [0] * 51      # indices 1..50 are used
        best_gain = 0

        for a in nums:
            # Maintain best suffix that ends here
            cnt[a] = max(cnt[a], cnt[k]) + 1
            best_gain = max(best_gain, cnt[a] - cnt[k])

        return cnt[k] + best_gain
```

---

### C++ (C++17)

```cpp
// 3434. Maximum Frequency After Subarray Operation
// Linear‑time solution using an array of size 51

class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequency(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // count array: indices 1..50 are valid
        array<int, 51> cnt = {0};
        int best_gain = 0;

        for (int a : nums) {
            cnt[a] = max(cnt[a], cnt[k]) + 1;
            best_gain = max(best_gain, cnt[a] - cnt[k]);
        }
        return cnt[k] + best_gain;
    }
};
```
