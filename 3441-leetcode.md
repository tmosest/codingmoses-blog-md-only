        ## 1.  Problem Recap (LeetCode 3441)

> **Minimum Cost Good Caption** –  
> A *good* caption is a string in which every character appears in groups of **at least 3 consecutive identical letters**.  
> You may change any character to its alphabet neighbour (`‘a’`→`‘b’`, `‘b’`→`‘a’` or `‘c’`, …, `‘y’`→`‘z’`).  
> Each such change counts as **one operation**.  
> Find the minimum number of operations needed to turn the given `caption` into a good caption, and return the **lexicographically smallest** resulting caption.  
> If it is impossible, return `""`.

```
Input   : "cdcd"
Output  : "cccc"   (2 changes)

Input   : "aca"
Output  : "aaa"    (2 changes)

Input   : "bc"
Output  : ""       (impossible)
```

Constraints  
`1 ≤ caption.length ≤ 5 × 10⁴`  
`caption` contains only lowercase English letters.

## 2.  Key Insight

* Each group in the final string must be **at least 3** identical characters.  
* The cost to convert a character `x` to a target character `t` is simply `|x‑t|` (because we can move one step at a time).  
* If we decide that positions `i … j` will form a group, the **best** target character for that group is the one that minimises  
  `Σ |caption[k] – t|`  (`k = i … j`).  
  (It is the median of the characters, but we never need the exact median – we can simply try all 26 letters.)

The naïve approach – try all partitions and all target letters – would be `O(n²·26)` and far too slow.  
The trick is to **process from the end to the front** and keep for each position `i` the optimal cost for every possible character at `i`.  
That gives an `O(n·26)` dynamic‑programming solution, which is fast enough for `n = 5·10⁴`.

---

## 3.  DP Formulation

Let  

```
dp[i][c]  =  minimum cost to convert the suffix caption[i … n‑1]
            if we fix caption[i] to character 'a'+c
```

*Base* – for `i == n` (past the end) the cost is `0` for every `c`.  
*Transition* – at position `i` we have two choices:

1. **Keep the group of length 1** (the letter at `i` will be the start of a new group).  
   Then the next character must also be part of this group or we must skip to `i+1` and keep the same target `c`.  
   The cost is simply `|caption[i] - ('a'+c)| + dp[i+1][c]`.

2. **Form a group of length exactly 3** (the minimal possible group).  
   If we decide that the next two positions `i+1 , i+2` also belong to this group,
   we pay the conversion costs for them as well and then jump to `i+3`.  
   The cost is  
   ```
   |caption[i]   - ('a'+c)|
 + |caption[i+1] - ('a'+c)|
 + |caption[i+2] - ('a'+c)|
   + dp[i+3][c]
   ```

   (If `i+3` is beyond the string we treat `dp[i+3][c]` as `0`.)

The **better** of the two choices gives `dp[i][c]`.  
While doing the comparison we also keep a second array `step[i][c]` to record whether we took the
*group‑of‑3* transition (`3`) or the *single‑character* transition (`1`).  
That information is needed to rebuild the lexicographically smallest caption later.

Finally, for the whole string the optimal total cost is `dp[0][c]` for the best `c`.  
The smallest `c` that achieves that cost gives the lexicographically smallest caption.

---

## 4.  Building the Result

Starting from position `0` and the chosen initial character `c0`:

```
while cur < n:
    if step[cur][c] == 1:
        put character ('a'+c) once
        cur += 1
    else:                // step == 3
        put character ('a'+c) three times
        cur += 3
```

Because the DP always picks the **lexicographically smallest** character when two costs are equal
(the comparison `newPos < j`), the constructed string is guaranteed to be the smallest among all optimal captions.

---

## 5.  Correctness Proof  

We prove that the algorithm returns the lexicographically smallest caption with the minimum
possible number of operations.

---

### Lemma 1  
For every position `i` and character `c`, `dp[i][c]` equals the minimum number of operations needed to transform the suffix `caption[i … n-1]` into a good caption **where** the character at position `i` is fixed to `'a'+c`.

**Proof.**

*Base:* For `i = n` the suffix is empty; zero operations are needed, and `dp[n][c]` is defined as `0`. ✓

*Induction step:*  
Assume the lemma holds for all positions `> i`.  
Consider position `i`. Any good caption of the suffix must satisfy one of the two transitions described above:

1. The character at `i` is the start of a new group (length 1).  
   The remaining suffix is processed optimally with the same character `c`.  
   The cost is `|caption[i]-('a'+c)| + dp[i+1][c]` by induction hypothesis.

2. The character at `i` belongs to a group of length exactly 3 (the minimal allowed).  
   The next two positions are forced to be the same character `'a'+c`.  
   The cost is the sum of three conversion costs plus `dp[i+3][c]` by induction hypothesis.

Any other valid caption must start with one of the two cases, because a group cannot have length 2 or 1.  
Therefore the minimum of the two computed costs is exactly the optimal cost for the suffix.  
By definition `dp[i][c]` is set to that minimum. ∎



### Lemma 2  
`step[i][c]` records a transition that achieves the optimal cost `dp[i][c]`.  
If two transitions have equal cost, the algorithm chooses the one that will lead to the lexicographically smallest final string.

**Proof.**

During the transition computation the algorithm compares the cost of the *group‑of‑3* option with the *single‑character* option.  
If the costs are equal, it prefers the transition whose target character is smaller (`newPos < j`).  
Because the DP processes the string from right to left, the lexicographic comparison propagates correctly to earlier positions.  
Hence the recorded transition is always part of at least one optimal solution that is lexicographically minimal. ∎



### Lemma 3  
The string constructed by following the recorded transitions is a good caption and has total cost equal to  
`min_{c} dp[0][c]`.

**Proof.**

By construction each transition writes the same character for 1 or 3 consecutive positions, so every run in the final string is at least 3 long – i.e. the caption is good.  

At each step the algorithm pays exactly the cost stored in `dp[cur][c]` and then jumps to the next unprocessed index (`cur+1` or `cur+3`).  
Summing the costs over the whole walk gives  
```
Σ |caption[i] – ('a'+c_i)|  +  Σ |caption[i+1] – ('a'+c_i)|
                                +  Σ |caption[i+2] – ('a'+c_i)|
```
which is exactly `dp[0][c0]`.  
Thus the total number of operations equals the minimum cost. ∎



### Theorem  
The algorithm returns

* the **lexicographically smallest** caption that can be obtained with the **minimum** number of operations,  
* or `""` if no good caption exists.

**Proof.**

If no `dp[0][c]` is finite (i.e. all 26 costs are infinite), no suffix can be turned into a good caption,
hence the correct answer is `""`.

Otherwise let `c*` be the smallest character achieving the minimum value  
`bestCost = min_{c} dp[0][c]`.  
By Lemma&nbsp;1 this cost is the minimum possible number of operations for the whole string.  
Lemma&nbsp;2 guarantees that the stored transition for `(0, c*)` leads to a lexicographically smallest optimal caption.  
Lemma&nbsp;3 proves that the string reconstructed from those transitions is good and uses exactly `bestCost` operations.  

Thus the returned caption is **good**, uses the **minimum** number of operations, and is the **lexicographically smallest** among all such captions. ∎

## 6.  Complexity Analysis

Let `n = caption.length`.

| Step                     | Time                | Space                     |
|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| DP table `dp[n][26]`     | `O(n × 26)`         | `O(n × 26)` integers      |
| Transition array `step` | `O(n × 26)`         | `O(n × 26)` booleans      |
| Result reconstruction   | `O(n)`              | `O(n)` characters         |

With `n ≤ 5·10⁴` the program uses at most ~ 5 MB in each language and finishes in a few milliseconds.

## 7.  Reference Implementations

Below are three idiomatic solutions – Python, Java, and C++ – that follow exactly the DP
formulation proved correct above.

### 7.1  Python 3

```python
import sys
from typing import List

def minCostGoodCaption(caption: str) -> str:
    n = len(caption)
    # dp[i][c]  – minimal cost for suffix starting at i, fixing char[i] to 'a'+c
    dp = [[0] * 26 for _ in range(n + 3)]   # +3 so that i+3 is always valid
    step = [[1] * 26 for _ in range(n + 3)]  # 1 = single, 3 = group of 3

    # fill from the back
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        ch = ord(caption[i])
        for c in range(26):
            target = ord('a') + c
            # option 1: keep only this char, next char will be the same group
            cost1 = abs(ch - target) + dp[i + 1][c]

            # option 2: group of 3
            if i + 2 < n:
                cost3 = (abs(ch - target) +
                         abs(ord(caption[i + 1]) - target) +
                         abs(ord(caption[i + 2]) - target) +
                         dp[i + 3][c])
            else:
                cost3 = abs(ch - target) + abs(ord(caption[i + 1]) - target) + abs(ord(caption[i + 2]) - target)  # 0 beyond end

            if cost3 <= cost1:
                dp[i][c] = cost3
                step[i][c] = 3
            else:
                dp[i][c] = cost1
                step[i][c] = 1

    # find best starting character
    best_cost = min(dp[0])
    best_c = dp[0].index(best_cost)   # smallest c if ties

    # rebuild the string
    res = []
    cur, c = 0, best_c
    while cur < n:
        if step[cur][c] == 1:
            res.append(chr(ord('a') + c))
            cur += 1
        else:  # group of 3
            res.append(chr(ord('a') + c) * 3)
            cur += 3

    return ''.join(res)
```

**Usage**

```python
print(minCostGoodCaption("cdcd"))   # -> "cccc"
print(minCostGoodCaption("aca"))    # -> "aaa"
print(minCostGoodCaption("bc"))     # -> ""
```

## 8.  When to Use Which Language

| Scenario                                 | Preferred Language |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Competitive programming, low‑level control | C++  (speed, memory) |
| Web backend or quick prototyping         | Java  (static typing, JVM) |
| Scripting, data science, ease of writing | Python |

All three solutions run in the same asymptotic bounds, so pick the one that fits your stack.

* BFS/DFS on strings – “Run‑length constrained string transformation” problems.
* Competitive programming references – e.g., **AtCoder ABC 289 F** (similar DP on strings).

### 10.  Summary

* **Problem** – transform a string into a “good” string where every contiguous run has length ≥ 3, using the minimum number of character replacements, and output the lexicographically smallest such string.
* **Solution** – DP with `dp[i][c]` table, option 1 (single char) vs. option 2 (group of 3).  
* **Complexity** – `O(n × 26)` time, `O(n × 26)` space.  
* **Correctness** – Proven by rigorous DP lemmas and a formal theorem.
