### Java – Sliding Window + Constant‑Space Counter

```java
/**
 * LeetCode 3456 – Find Special Substring of Length K
 *
 * @author  ChatGPT
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean hasSpecialSubstring(String s, int k) {
        if (s == null || s.length() < k) return false;

        int n = s.length();
        int count = 1;                 // current run length
        char prev = s.charAt(0);       // char of current run

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            char cur = s.charAt(i);

            if (cur == prev) {                     // same run
                count++;
                if (count == k) {
                    // run reached length k, check boundaries
                    boolean leftDiff  = (i - k < 0)   || s.charAt(i - k) != cur;
                    boolean rightDiff = (i + 1 >= n) || s.charAt(i + 1) != cur;
                    if (leftDiff && rightDiff) return true;
                }
            } else {                                // run breaks
                count = 1;
                prev = cur;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Explanation**

* We walk once over the string.  
* `count` keeps the length of the current identical‑char run.  
* When `count == k`, we check the two neighboring characters (or the absence of them).  
* If both neighbors differ (or don't exist), we found a valid substring.  
* Time = O(n), space = O(1).

### Python – One‑Pass Scan

```python
# LeetCode 3456 – Find Special Substring of Length K
# Author: ChatGPT

def hasSpecialSubstring(s: str, k: int) -> bool:
    if not s or len(s) < k:
        return False

    n = len(s)
    count = 1
    prev = s[0]

    for i in range(1, n):
        cur = s[i]
        if cur == prev:
            count += 1
            if count == k:
                left_diff  = (i - k < 0) or s[i - k] != cur
                right_diff = (i + 1 >= n) or s[i + 1] != cur
                if left_diff and right_diff:
                    return True
        else:
            count = 1
            prev = cur
    return False
```

**Why this works**

The logic mirrors the Java implementation.  
Python’s `range` makes the loop concise, and the boundary checks use short‑circuit logic for readability.

### C++ – Classic Linear Scan

```cpp
// LeetCode 3456 – Find Special Substring of Length K
// Author: ChatGPT

#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    bool hasSpecialSubstring(std::string s, int k) {
        if (s.empty() || static_cast<int>(s.size()) < k)
            return false;

        int n = s.size();
        int count = 1;           // length of current run
        char prev = s[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            char cur = s[i];
            if (cur == prev) {
                ++count;
                if (count == k) {
                    bool leftDiff  = (i - k < 0) || s[i - k] != cur;
                    bool rightDiff = (i + 1 >= n) || s[i + 1] != cur;
                    if (leftDiff && rightDiff) return true;
                }
            } else {
                count = 1;
                prev = cur;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

## 2.  Blog Article: “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of LeetCode 3456 – Find Special Substring of Length K”

### Introduction – Why This Problem Matters

> *“If you can solve this simple-looking LeetCode problem, you can ace the string‑handling section of any FAANG interview.”*

LeetCode **3456 – Find Special Substring of Length K** is marked **Easy**, but the subtle boundary conditions make it a *golden* candidate for interview practice:

* **Only one distinct character** in the substring.  
* **Adjacent characters** (if present) must differ from the substring’s character.  
* **Length exactly** `k`.

It tests your ability to:

1. **Traverse** a string efficiently.  
2. **Track consecutive runs** of the same character.  
3. **Handle edge cases** (start/end of string).  

Because the constraints are tiny (`s.length <= 100`), an *O(n²)* brute force solution passes, yet interviewers look for a *linear* approach. Let's dissect the problem with the classic **Good‑Bad‑Ugly** lens.

---

### The Good – Clean, Linear, O(n)

#### ✅ 1‑Pass Sliding Window

*Traverse once, maintain a counter for the current run of identical characters.*  
When the counter reaches `k`, verify that the neighboring characters differ (or don’t exist).  

**Why it’s good**

- **O(n)** time – perfectly scalable, even if constraints balloon.  
- **O(1)** extra space – a constant‑memory counter and a few variables.  
- Clear logic – “run length → check neighbors” is easy to reason about.  

The Java, Python, and C++ implementations above are perfect examples.

#### ✅ Intuitive “Run” Concept

Think of the string as a series of blocks of the same letter.  
If any block has length `k` and is “isolated” by a different character on each side, you’re done.  
This mental model reduces the problem to a single scan.

---

### The Bad – Boundary Pitfalls and Off‑By‑One Errors

Even a simple linear algorithm can trip you up:

| Bad | Why it breaks |
|-----|---------------|
| Forgetting that the substring may start at index 0 or end at `n‑1`. | Boundary checks (`i-k < 0`, `i+1 >= n`) must be **inclusive**. |
| Using `count == k` only after the loop ends. | A run could end in the middle of the string; you must check *inside* the loop. |
| Over‑incrementing the counter on every iteration. | When characters differ, reset `count` to **1**, not **0**. |

**Common interview slip‑up:** writing the check as `if (count == k) { /* neighbors */ }` *after* the `else` block, which causes a false negative when the run ends right at the boundary.

---

### The Ugly – Brute‑Force O(n²) and Why It’s a Bad Idea

A naive approach is:

1. Enumerate every starting index `i`.  
2. Check if the next `k` characters are identical.  
3. Verify neighbors.  

While this passes the problem on LeetCode due to the small input size, it is *ugly* for two reasons:

* **Excessive time** – quadratic complexity becomes a nightmare for larger strings.  
* **Harder to reason about** – nested loops hide the simplicity of the “run” concept.

Interviewers dislike this because it reflects a *lack of insight* into the problem structure.

---

### Step‑by‑Step Walkthrough – Java Implementation

```java
int count = 1;          // run length
char prev = s.charAt(0);
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    char cur = s.charAt(i);
    if (cur == prev) {
        ++count;
        if (count == k) {
            boolean leftDiff  = (i - k < 0) || s.charAt(i - k) != cur;
            boolean rightDiff = (i + 1 >= n) || s.charAt(i + 1) != cur;
            if (leftDiff && rightDiff) return true;
        }
    } else {
        count = 1;
        prev = cur;
    }
}
```

* `count == k` is checked **immediately** when the run reaches length `k`.  
* Boundary checks use **non‑negative** and **less‑than‑n** conditions to avoid `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  

Feel free to copy‑paste into your LeetCode submission or your local IDE.

### Why This Problem Is a Great Interview Filler

* **String handling** – a core skill for any SDE role.  
* **Edge‑case awareness** – boundary checks are a frequent interview trap.  
* **Time/Space analysis** – a clean solution demonstrates algorithmic thinking.  

If you can articulate why the linear solution is preferable, interviewers will see you as *thoughtful* and *methodical*.
