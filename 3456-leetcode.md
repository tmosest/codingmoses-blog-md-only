            if (i == n || s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i - 1)) {
                int len = i - start;
                if (len == k) {
                    char c = s.charAt(start);
                    // Check char before the run
                    if (start == 0 || s.charAt(start - 1) != c) {
                        // Check char after the run
                        if (i == n || s.charAt(i) != c) {
                            return true;
                        }
                    }
                }
                start = i;            // new run starts

                if before_ok and after_ok:

| **C++** | `bool hasSpecialSubstring(string s, int k)` | **O(n)** time, **O(1)** space | <details><summary>Click to expand</summary>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

bool hasSpecialSubstring(string s, int k) {
    int n = s.size();
    int start = 0;                     // start index of the current run

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (i == n || s[i] != s[i - 1]) {
            int len = i - start;
            if (len == k) {
                char c = s[start];
                bool before_ok = (start == 0) || s[start - 1] != c;
                bool after_ok  = (i == n)     || s[i] != c;
                if (before_ok && after_ok) return true;
            }
            start = i;                  // new run starts
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

> **Why this approach is fast**  
> - We *only* walk the string once (`O(n)`).  
> - We keep just a few integers (`O(1)` space).  
> - No extra data structures, no repeated substring checks.

## 2️⃣ Blog Article – “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of LeetCode 3456”

### H1 – Cracking LeetCode 3456: Find Special Substring of Length K  
#### The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly – A Deep‑Dive for Your Next FAANG Interview

---

### H2 – 1️⃣ Problem Snapshot

> **LeetCode 3456** – *Find Special Substring of Length K*  
> **Goal** – Determine if a string `s` contains a **single‑character** substring of exact length `k` that is *sandwiched* by *different* characters (or string boundaries).  
> **Constraints** – `1 ≤ k ≤ |s| ≤ 100`, only lowercase English letters.

---

### H2 – 2️⃣ Naïve Thoughts (The Ugly)

| Approach | What you might think | Why it fails |
|----------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Brute‑force substring generation** | Generate every `k`‑length slice and check | `O(n·k)` time, `O(k)` space, still fine for 100 but **unscalable** for real‑world interview strings. |
| **Regex / Pattern Matching** | `(?<!c)c{${k}}(?!c)` | Hard to read, **language‑specific**, often fails on corner cases (boundary conditions). |
| **Two‑pass** – Count then validate | Count consecutive `c` first, then re‑scan | Still `O(n)` but adds complexity; can miss boundary checks if not careful. |

> **Lesson**: In interviews, the “good” code is **clean** and **predictable**. Ugly solutions look like they might work but will trip up on hidden test cases.

---

### H2 – 3️⃣ The Good: One‑Pass Run‑Detection

#### 3.1 👉 Core Idea

Walk the string once, keep track of the **current run** of identical characters:

1. **When a run ends** (`s[i] != s[i-1]` or end of string), check its length.  
2. If the run length equals `k`, ensure:
   * The character before the run (if any) is different.
   * The character after the run (if any) is different.
3. Reset the start index to the next character.

#### 3.2 👉 Implementation Highlights

| Language | Key Points |
|----------|------------|
| **Java** | `s.charAt(i)` for O(1) char access; `start` index tracks run start. |
| **Python** | `for i in range(1, n+1):` elegantly handles end-of-string check. |
| **C++** | `for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)` with `string::size()`; concise conditionals. |

#### 3.3 👉 Complexity

- **Time** – `O(n)` (single linear scan).  
- **Space** – `O(1)` (a handful of integers).

#### 3.4 👉 Edge Cases Handled

| Edge | Why it matters | Code check |
|------|----------------|------------|
| Substring at **start** | No preceding character → automatically satisfies “different”. | `start == 0` |
| Substring at **end** | No following character → automatically satisfies “different”. | `i == n` |
| **Single character string** | k = 1; need to ensure neighbors differ. | Handles by same logic. |

---

### H2 – 4️⃣ Alternative: Sliding Window (The Ugly)

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Sliding window** – Keep a window of size `k` and track character counts | Familiar pattern, easy to reason in interviews | Requires extra O(1) array for counts, more code, subtle off‑by‑one bugs |
| **Stack/Deque** – Push runs, pop when length hits `k` | Interesting data‑structure twist | Overkill for this simple problem |

> **Verdict**: Stick to the run‑detection; sliding window is **more verbose** and introduces unnecessary variables.

---

### H2 – 5️⃣ Why This Matters for Your Job Hunt

| Skill | Demonstrated by this solution | Interview Impact |
|-------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Problem Decomposition** | Break string into runs → clear sub‑tasks | Shows you can think modularly |
| **Edge‑Case Handling** | Boundary checks for start/end | Impresses hiring managers |
| **Algorithmic Efficiency** | O(n) time, O(1) space | Meets FAANG expectations |
| **Clean Code** | One loop, few variables, self‑documenting | Easier to review & maintain |
| **Multi‑Language Mastery** | Java, Python, C++ | Demonstrates versatility |

> **Pro Tip**: In a live coding interview, narrate your thought process: *“I’m scanning for runs; when a run ends I’ll compare its length with k and then check the neighbors.”* This transparency earns you extra points.

---

### H2 – 6️⃣ Testing Checklist (SEO‑Friendly Keywords)

| Test | Keyword | Why it’s important |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| `s = "aaabaaa", k = 3` | *special substring* | Classic LeetCode example |
| `s = "abc", k = 2` | *no special substring* | Negative case |
| `s = "a", k = 1` | *single‑character string* | Edge case |
| `s = "aaaaa", k = 5` | *full string* | Boundary on both ends |
| `s = "abbaaaabb", k = 3` | *sandwiched substring* | Neighbor check |

---

### H2 – 7️⃣ Final Thoughts (The Good)

- **Simplicity wins**: a single pass, constant space, no fancy data structures.  
- **Readability matters**: variable names (`start`, `i`) speak louder than `idx`, `len`.  
- **Talk through your algorithm**: the interviewer is watching *how* you think, not just the answer.

> **Takeaway**: Master this pattern (run detection) and you’ll be ready for similar “substring with constraints” problems in any FAANG interview.

---

### H2 – 8️⃣ Bonus: Code Reuse – One‑Line Python Version

```python
def has_special_substring(s, k):
    return any(
        all(c == s[i] for i in range(j, j+k)) and
        (j == 0 or s[j-1] != s[i]) and
        (j+k == len(s) or s[j+k] != s[i])
        for j, c in enumerate(s)
        for i in [j+k-1]
    )
```

> *Clever?* Yes – but not the interview‑friendly choice. Use the one‑pass version to keep it safe.
