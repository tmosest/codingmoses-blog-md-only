        ## 1.  Problem Recap  
**LeetCode 3460 – Longest Common Prefix After at Most One Removal**  

> You’re given two strings `s` and `t`.  
>  You may delete **at most one** character from `s` (or delete none).  
>  Return the length of the longest common prefix that `s` and `t` can share after the removal.

| Example | Input | Output | Explanation |
|--------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `s = "madxa"`, `t = "madam"` | `4` | Remove `s[3]` → `"mada"` |
| 2 | `s = "leetcode"`, `t = "eetcode"` | `7` | Remove `s[0]` → `"eetcode"` |
| 3 | `s = "one"`, `t = "one"` | `3` | No removal needed |
| 4 | `s = "a"`, `t = "b"` | `0` | No common prefix |

> **Constraints**  
> `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5`  
> `s` and `t` contain only lowercase English letters.

---

## 2.  Solution Overview  

The classic “two‑pointer” technique is all you need.  
While we compare the characters of the two strings from the beginning, we keep a flag `removed` that tells us whether we have already deleted one character from `s`.  
When we see a mismatch:

* **If we haven’t removed yet** – skip the current character of `s` (effectively delete it) and set `removed = true`.  
* **If we have already removed** – we cannot skip any more characters, so the current matched length is the answer.

The algorithm stops when one string ends or when we cannot match any further.  
Time complexity: **O(min(|s|, |t|))** – each index moves forward at most once.  
Space complexity: **O(1)** – only a few integer variables.

## 3.  Reference Implementations  

### 3.1 Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public int longestCommonPrefix(String s, String t) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;          // pointers for s and t
        int len = 0;               // current matched prefix length
        boolean removed = false;   // have we already deleted a char from s?

        while (i < s.length() && j < t.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) {
                i++; j++; len++;
            } else if (!removed) {
                // delete current char from s and remember we used our removal
                removed = true;
                i++;
            } else {
                // second mismatch after deletion – can't match further
                break;
            }
        }
        return len;
    }
}
```

> **Why it works** – We never need to look ahead: as soon as a mismatch happens, either we use our one deletion (if we still have it) or we stop.  
> **Edge‑cases** – Strings of length 1, empty prefix, or no possible deletion are all handled by the loop logic.

---

### 3.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        i = j = 0
        length = 0
        removed = False

        while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i += 1
                j += 1
                length += 1
            elif not removed:
                # Skip the character in s
                removed = True
                i += 1
            else:
                break
        return length
```

> **Pythonic notes** – We use plain integers and booleans; no additional data structures are required.  
> **Complexity** – Same as Java: O(min(n, m)) time, O(1) space.

---

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonPrefix(string s, string t) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int len = 0;
        bool removed = false;

        while (i < (int)s.size() && j < (int)t.size()) {
            if (s[i] == t[j]) {
                ++i; ++j; ++len;
            } else if (!removed) {
                // Delete current char from s
                removed = true;
                ++i;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return len;
    }
};
```

> **Why `int` works** – `s.size()` can be up to `1e5`, well within the range of `int`.  
> **C++ idiom** – Use `++` operators for minimal overhead.

## 4.  The “Good, the Bad, and the Ugly” of this Problem  

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Algorithmic Simplicity** | Two‑pointer trick is intuitive and fast. | The problem looks like “edit distance”, which might tempt a DP solution. | A naive O(n²) comparison with a loop‑over‑removal would time out on 10⁵. |
| **Time Complexity** | O(min(n, m)) – linear in the length of the shorter string. | Still linear but with an additional constant factor if you check every possible removal. | O(n·m) if you compare every suffix after removing each character. |
| **Space Complexity** | O(1) – perfect for interview settings. | Using auxiliary arrays or a DP matrix would waste memory. | Building all possible strings after removal (O(n²) memory). |
| **Edge Cases** | Handles empty prefix, single‑character strings, no removal needed. | Forgetting to stop after the second mismatch leads to incorrect answers. | Over‑engineering with recursion or memoization unnecessarily complicates the solution. |
| **Readability** | Short code, clear variable names (`removed`, `len`). | Over‑commenting or using too many nested conditions can obscure intent. | Obscure variable names (`a`, `b`, `c`) make the logic unreadable. |

### Introduction  

If you’re preparing for a software‑engineering interview, LeetCode’s “Longest Common Prefix After at Most One Removal” (Problem 3460) is a great test of both your algorithmic thinking and your ability to write clean, efficient code.  
In this article we’ll walk through the problem statement, provide **three** reference implementations (Java, Python, C++), and explain the pros/cons of different approaches. We’ll also sprinkle in some interview‑style advice: when to use a two‑pointer technique, how to avoid the pitfalls of brute‑force, and what recruiters look for in a clean solution.

---

### 1. Problem Breakdown  

- **Input**: two lowercase strings `s` and `t`.  
- **Operation**: delete at most one character from `s`.  
- **Goal**: maximize the length of the common prefix of the resulting string and `t`.  
- **Output**: integer – the maximum prefix length.

Because `|s|` and `|t|` can reach **100 000**, we need an **O(n)** solution.

---

### 2. The Two‑Pointer Insight  

Think of `s` and `t` as two lanes of a road.  
We start at the leftmost positions of both lanes and walk forward simultaneously:

1. If the cars (characters) match, keep walking.  
2. If they collide (mismatch), we’re allowed to “jump over” one car from `s` – that’s our one removal.  
3. Once we’ve used our jump, any subsequent collision means the road ends; we return the distance walked so far.

Because we never backtrack, each index moves at most once → linear time.  
Only four integer variables are required → constant space.

---

### 3. Code Snippets  

(See the three sections above for Java, Python, C++.)

> **Why the same logic works across languages** – The algorithm is language‑agnostic: just two indices, a flag, and a counter.  
> **Readability tip** – Name the flag `removed` (or `deleted`) and the counter `len`. It tells the story at a glance.

---

### 4. Interview‑Ready Discussion  

- **Explain the edge case**: `s = "a"`, `t = "b"`. The loop ends immediately, answer `0`.  
- **Why not DP?** – A DP matrix would be **O(n·m)** and unnecessary here.  
- **Time vs. space** – Interviewers love constant‑space solutions; they demonstrate you can “think in-place”.

### 5. Good, Bad, Ugly – A Quick Reference  

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| Algorithm | Two‑pointer, linear | DP or brute force | Recursive backtracking |
| Code clarity | Self‑documenting variables | Excessive comments | Obscure variable names |
| Complexity | O(min(n,m)) | O(n·m) | O(n²) |
| Scalability | Handles 10⁵ | Times out | Crashes memory |

---

### 6. Take‑away Checklist  

- [ ] **Understand the “one removal” constraint** – treat it as a single “skip” operation.  
- [ ] **Implement a two‑pointer loop** – one for `s`, one for `t`.  
- [ ] **Track the removal state** – simple boolean flag.  
- [ ] **Stop on second mismatch** – that’s the prefix length.  
- [ ] **Test edge cases** – empty prefix, no removal needed, maximum string lengths.

---

## 7. Final Thoughts  

LeetCode 3460 is an excellent playground for practicing the two‑pointer pattern and for showcasing your ability to write clean, efficient code in multiple languages.  
Whether you’re coding on the whiteboard or in a live coding interview, the approach described above will impress hiring managers: it’s simple, it runs fast, and it uses minimal space.

Good luck, happy coding, and may your prefix always stay long!
