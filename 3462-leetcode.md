        ## 🔥 Leetcode 3462 – “Maximum Sum With at Most K Elements”  
### The **Greedy + Max‑Heap** solution (Java, Python, C++)

| Language | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| Java     | **O(n m log(n m))** | **O(n m)** |
| Python   | **O(n m log(n m))** | **O(n m)** |
| C++      | **O(n m log(n m))** | **O(n m)** |

> **Why this post?**  
> *You’re preparing for a tech‑interview, want a solid Leetcode solution, and need to showcase clean, production‑ready code. This article covers the *easy‑to‑understand* greedy approach, pitfalls, and SEO‑friendly explanations that help you land your next role.*

## 1️⃣ Problem Recap

> **Given** a grid `grid[n][m]`, an array `limits[n]`, and an integer `k`.  
> **Goal**: pick at most `k` elements such that no more than `limits[i]` elements are taken from row `i`, and the total sum is maximized.

---

## 2️⃣ Intuition – “Always grab the biggest available value”

1. **Greedy choice** – The largest value that can still be selected will never hurt the final sum.
2. **Row constraint** – We must remember how many items have already been taken from each row.
3. **Efficient retrieval** – A *max‑heap* (priority queue) gives us the next largest element in `O(log N)`.

> **Proof sketch** –  
> Assume the optimal solution does **not** take the current maximum value `x`.  
> Replacing the smallest selected element with `x` increases the sum while keeping row limits intact, contradicting optimality.

---

## 3️⃣ Algorithm Steps

1. **Push every grid cell into a max‑heap** with its value and row index.  
2. Maintain an array `taken[n]` – how many elements we have already taken from each row.  
3. While `k > 0` and the heap isn’t empty:  
   * pop the top (largest value `val`, row `r`).  
   * if `taken[r] < limits[r]`: add `val` to answer, increment `taken[r]`, decrement `k`.  
   * else discard this value and continue.  
4. Return the accumulated sum.

---

## 4️⃣ Complexity

- **Time**: `O(n*m*log(n*m))` – each element is inserted once and potentially popped once.  
- **Space**: `O(n*m)` – heap stores all elements.

---

## 5️⃣ Code

Below are ready‑to‑paste solutions in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**. All are fully commented and use 64‑bit types (`long` / `long long`) because the sum can reach `10^5 * 500 * 500 ≈ 2.5×10^10`.

### 5.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public long maxSum(int[][] grid, int[] limits, int k) {
        int n = grid.length, m = grid[0].length;
        long sum = 0L;

        // Max‑heap: element = {value, rowIndex}
        PriorityQueue<int[]> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(
                (a, b) -> Integer.compare(b[0], a[0])
        );

        // Push all grid cells
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                maxHeap.offer(new int[]{grid[i][j], i});
            }
        }

        int[] taken = new int[n];          // how many we already selected per row

        while (k > 0 && !maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            int[] cur = maxHeap.poll();
            int val = cur[0];
            int row = cur[1];

            if (taken[row] < limits[row]) {
                sum += val;
                taken[row]++;
                k--;
            }
            // otherwise discard this value and try next largest
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### 5.2 Python 3

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxSum(self, grid: List[List[int]], limits: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        # Python's heapq is a min‑heap; push negatives for max‑heap
        max_heap = []
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-grid[i][j], i))

        taken = [0] * n
        total = 0

        while k and max_heap:
            val, row = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            val = -val  # revert sign

            if taken[row] < limits[row]:
                total += val
                taken[row] += 1
                k -= 1
        return total
```

---

### 5.3 C++ (GNU++17)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long maxSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid,
                     vector<int>& limits,
                     int k) {
        int n = grid.size(), m = grid[0].size();
        long long sum = 0;

        // max‑heap: pair(value, row)
        priority_queue<pair<int,int>> pq;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j)
                pq.push({grid[i][j], i});

        vector<int> taken(n, 0);

        while (k > 0 && !pq.empty()) {
            auto [val, row] = pq.top(); pq.pop();
            if (taken[row] < limits[row]) {
                sum += val;
                ++taken[row];
                --k;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

## 6️⃣ Common Pitfalls (The “Bad” and “Ugly” Parts)

| Pitfall | Why it happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Using 32‑bit sum** | The total can exceed 2^31‑1. | Use `long`/`long long`. |
| **Not checking row limits** | May exceed `limits[i]`, violating constraints. | Keep `taken[row]` array and skip when full. |
| **Ignoring that `k` may be 0** | Infinite loop if heap never empties. | Loop condition `while (k > 0 && !pq.empty())`. |
| **Sorting each row individually (O(n*m log m))** | Works but unnecessary extra overhead. | Single global max‑heap is simpler and faster. |
| **Using a min‑heap without negating** | Would pop smallest instead of largest. | In Python, push `-value`. |

---

## 7️⃣ Edge‑Case Testing

```text
Test 1: Single cell
grid = [[5]], limits=[1], k=1  -> 5

Test 2: k larger than all limits
grid = [[1,2],[3,4]], limits=[0,0], k=10 -> 0

Test 3: k equals sum(limits)
grid = [[5,4,3],[2,1,0]], limits=[2,1], k=3 -> 5+4+2 = 11

Test 4: All zeros
grid = [[0,0],[0,0]], limits=[1,1], k=2 -> 0
```

---

## 8️⃣ Variations & Optimizations

| Variation | What to consider | Typical Complexity |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------|
| **`k` very small** | Only top `k` elements matter. | `O(n*m + k log(n*m))` – you can stop early. |
| **Large `n` & `m` (500)** | 250k cells – heap fits comfortably. | Same as above. |
| **Multiple queries on same grid** | Pre‑sort each row, maintain global pointer. | `O(n*m log m)` preprocessing + `O(k log n)` per query. |

## 9️⃣ Take‑away: Why this solution is a job‑worthy snippet

1. **Greedy proof** – Clear reasoning that you’re not just guessing.
2. **Clean code** – Uses language‑idiomatic data structures (`PriorityQueue`, `heapq`, `priority_queue`).
3. **Robustness** – Handles edge cases, uses 64‑bit sums, respects constraints.
4. **Scalable** – Works comfortably within Leetcode’s limits (500 × 500).

Feel free to paste the snippet into your interview prep, tweak it for readability, or adapt it to other constraints (e.g., “at most k items from the entire grid”).

### ⚠️ Edge‑Case & Pitfall Checklist

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Overflow of 32‑bit sum | `long` / `long long` |
| Row limit breach | `taken[row]` counter |
| `k == 0` | Loop guard `while (k > 0 && !pq.empty())` |

This checklist is a quick reference for any candidate preparing for data‑structure questions.
