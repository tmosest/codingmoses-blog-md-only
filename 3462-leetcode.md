        ## 1.  Problem Recap (Leetcode 3462)

**Maximum Sum With at Most K Elements**  
Given

* a grid `n × m` of non‑negative integers,
* an array `limits[0 … n‑1]` that tells you how many elements you may take from each row,
* an integer `k` that limits the total number of selected elements,

**find the maximum possible sum** of at most `k` elements while never exceeding the per‑row limits.

*Constraints*

| n | m | grid[i][j] | limits[i] | k |
|---|---|------------|-----------|---|
| ≤ 500 | ≤ 500 | 0 … 10⁵ | 0 … m | 0 … min(n × m, Σ limits) |

The values are large enough that a 32‑bit integer may overflow, so the answer is returned as `long`.

## 2.  Solution Overview

The greedy strategy that always picks the currently largest available value is optimal.

* Every time we want the next element we look at the **largest** number that we have not yet used.
* We can use a **max‑heap (priority queue)** to retrieve this element in `O(log (n × m))`.
* While pulling elements we keep a counter `chosen[row]` that tells how many values have already been taken from that row.
  * If `chosen[row] < limits[row]` we can add the value to our sum.
  * Otherwise the element is discarded and we move on.

Because we never look back (the heap always contains all remaining values), the algorithm guarantees the maximum sum.

## 3.  Complexity

| Step | Work | Reason |
|------|------|--------|
| Build heap | `n × m` pushes | `O(n × m log(n × m))` |
| Extract elements | at most `k` pops | `O(k log(n × m))` |
| Total | | **O((n × m + k) log(n × m))** |
| Extra space | heap + counters | **O(n × m)** |

Given the constraints (`n,m ≤ 500` → at most 250 000 elements), this easily fits within time limits.

## 4.  Code

Below you’ll find clean, beginner‑friendly implementations in **Java, Python, and C++**.  
All three use the same idea: a max‑heap and an array of per‑row counters.

### 4.1  Java

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class Solution {
    public long maxSum(int[][] grid, int[] limits, int k) {
        int n = grid.length, m = grid[0].length;
        long sum = 0L;

        // Max‑heap: element value, row index
        PriorityQueue<long[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(
                (a, b) -> Long.compare(b[0], a[0])          // descending
        );

        // Push every element into the heap
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
                pq.offer(new long[]{grid[i][j], i});
            }
        }

        int[] taken = new int[n];        // how many from each row

        while (k > 0 && !pq.isEmpty()) {
            long[] top = pq.poll();
            long value = top[0];
            int row   = (int) top[1];

            if (taken[row] < limits[row]) {
                sum += value;
                taken[row]++;
                k--;                       // one less slot left
            }
        }

        return sum;
    }
}
```

### 4.2  Python

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxSum(self, grid: List[List[int]],
               limits: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        # Use a max‑heap by pushing negative values
        pq = [(-grid[i][j], i) for i in range(n) for j in range(m)]
        heapq.heapify(pq)

        taken = [0] * n
        total = 0

        while k and pq:
            val, row = heapq.heappop(pq)
            val = -val          # restore original value
            if taken[row] < limits[row]:
                total += val
                taken[row] += 1
                k -= 1

        return total
```

---

### 4.3  C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long maxSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid,
                     vector<int>& limits, int k) {
        int n = grid.size(), m = grid[0].size();
        long long sum = 0;

        // max‑heap: pair(value, row)
        priority_queue<pair<int,int>> pq;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j)
                pq.emplace(grid[i][j], i);

        vector<int> taken(n, 0);

        while (k > 0 && !pq.empty()) {
            auto [val, row] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            if (taken[row] < limits[row]) {
                sum += val;
                ++taken[row];
                --k;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

All three programs produce the same result in `O((n×m + k) log(n×m))` time and `O(n×m)` memory.

## 5.  Blog Article: “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of Leetcode 3462”

### 5.1  Why Leetcode 3462 Matters

- **Interview buzz‑word:** “Maximum Sum With at Most K Elements” is a classic *greedy + heap* problem that tests your ability to balance per‑row constraints and a global limit.
- **Job‑ready skills:** The solution demonstrates knowledge of priority queues, greedy algorithms, and careful integer handling (long/64‑bit).
- **SEO tags**: *Leetcode 3462, maximum sum with at most k elements, interview algorithm, priority queue, greedy, Java, Python, C++*.

If you want to land a software‑engineering role, mastering this problem will impress hiring managers and show you can turn a seemingly hard problem into a clean, optimal solution.

---

### 5.2  The Good: A Clean Greedy Approach

1. **Intuitive** – “Pick the biggest number you can still take.”  
2. **Optimal** – The greedy choice property holds because every element is independent of others aside from the row‑limit.
3. **Simple implementation** – Just a max‑heap and a counter array.
4. **Scalable** – Works up to 250 000 grid cells; well under Leetcode’s limits.

> **Result**: Linear‑ith‑log‑time, constant‑space per‑row overhead.

### 5.3  The Bad: What You Must Watch Out For

| Issue | Why it matters | Fix |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| **Integer overflow** | Grid values up to 10⁵, and k up to 250 000 → sum can reach 2.5×10¹⁰. | Use 64‑bit (`long` in Java, `long long` in C++, `int` in Python is unbounded). |
| **Large heap** | Storing all elements consumes memory (`O(n*m)`). | It’s inevitable for the optimal greedy solution, but still fits in 256 MB for given constraints. |
| **Tight constraints** | `k` may be as low as 0 or as high as `min(n*m, Σ limits)`. | The algorithm naturally handles both extremes – it just pulls fewer or all elements. |
| **Time limit** | `O((n*m + k) log(n*m))` is fine, but if `k` ≈ `n*m`, the log factor dominates. | Still fast enough for 250 k elements: ≈ 4–5 million heap operations – < 0.2 s in modern languages. |

---

### 5.4  The Ugly: Alternative (and Sub‑optimal) Approaches

| Approach | Why it’s Ugly | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Brute‑Force DP** | Exponential combinations per row. | Enumerate all subsets of each row → `O(n * 2^m)`. |
| **Sorting rows individually** | Requires nested loops and custom counting, less elegant. | Sort each row, then merge top k values with per‑row checks. |
| **Min‑heap of selected values** | Inverse logic; you must pop the smallest to decide when to discard, leading to more bookkeeping. | Push selected elements to a min‑heap and discard when over `k`. |

These methods either blow up in time or add unnecessary complexity. The heap‑greedy strategy remains the cleanest, fastest, and most maintainable solution.
