        **Solution Explanation**

For every query

```
[ l , r , v ]
```

you may choose *any* subset of indices `l … r` and decrease each chosen index by `v`.
The queries must be applied in the given order – we are allowed to use only the first `k`
queries and we have to decide the smallest `k` that can transform the whole array into
zeros.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 1.  Observations

*For a fixed index `i`*  
only the queries whose range contains `i` are useful.  
If we look at the first `k` queries, the multiset

```
D(i , k) = { v of all queries 0 … k-1 that cover i }
```

is the set of numbers we are allowed to add (as a subset) to the current value of
`i`.  
`i` can become zero **iff** we can pick a subset of `D(i , k)` whose sum is exactly
`nums[i]`.

*Monotonicity*  
If a certain `k` works, every larger `k' ≥ k` can only add more numbers to each `D(i,k)`,
hence it also works.  
So the predicate *“`k` is sufficient”* is monotone – we can binary‑search for the first
`k` that satisfies it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2.  High level algorithm

```
if all nums are already zero → answer = 0

build D(i,*) for every i once  (pre‑processing)
binary search on k ∈ [1 … m]
        if feasibility(k) = true → high = k
        else                       low  = k + 1
if no k works → answer = -1
```

The core part is the **feasibility test** for a given `k`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2.1  Feasibility test – subset sum per index

For every index `i` we have the vector

```
vals[i] = list of all (v , queryIndex) that cover i
```

All pairs are stored in increasing order of `queryIndex`.

For a particular `k` we keep only the pairs whose `queryIndex < k`:

```
candidate = { v of (v,idx) in vals[i] | idx < k }
```

Now we have to decide whether a subset of `candidate` sums to `nums[i]`.
This is the classical 0/1 knapsack (subset‑sum) problem and can be solved with a
boolean DP of size `target + 1` (`target = nums[i]`).

Because the total number of values that may be inserted in a DP is the length of
`candidate`, the running time of one feasibility check is

```
∑ over i ( |candidate(i)| × nums[i] )
```

`nums[i]` never exceeds **10 000** (the statement guarantees that the sum of all
array elements is ≤ 10 000), therefore a simple DP array of that size is fast enough.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 3.  Correctness Proof  

We prove that the algorithm returns the minimal number of queries or `-1`.

---

##### Lemma 1  
For a fixed index `i` and a fixed `k`,
`i` can become zero after applying the first `k` queries  
**iff** there exists a subset of `D(i , k)` whose sum equals `nums[i]`.

**Proof.**

*If part:*  
Assume such a subset exists.  
Apply the corresponding queries one after another – each query that contains `i`
is used exactly once on the chosen indices, decreasing the value of `i` by the
subset’s sum.  
After all `k` queries are processed, the value of `i` is `nums[i] - sum = 0`.

*Only if part:*  
If after all `k` queries the value of `i` is zero,
every time a query that covers `i` was applied we either decreased `i` by `v` or
did not touch it at all.  
Thus the set of all `v` that were used on `i` is a subset of `D(i , k)` and its sum is
exactly `nums[i]`. ∎



##### Lemma 2  
If a certain `k` satisfies the feasibility test (i.e. all indices can be zeroed),
then any `k' > k` also satisfies it.

**Proof.**

All queries with indices `k … k'-1` are *new* and are added to each `D(i , k')`
as additional elements.  
Therefore every subset that was possible for `k` is still possible for `k'`.  
Consequently the feasibility test is still true. ∎



##### Lemma 3  
During the binary search the predicate  
“the first `k` queries are sufficient”  
is monotone.

**Proof.**

Direct consequence of Lemma&nbsp;2. ∎



##### Lemma 4  
If the feasibility test declares a certain `k` feasible,
then the algorithm never outputs a value smaller than `k`.

**Proof.**

The binary search only narrows the interval `[low, high]` while keeping the
property that all indices inside `[low, high]` contain at least one feasible `k`
(Lemma&nbsp;3).  
If the test for `k` is true, the algorithm sets `high = k`; otherwise it sets
`low = k+1`.  
Therefore the search space is always a contiguous range of feasible `k` values,
and it will never skip a smaller feasible `k`. ∎



##### Lemma 5  
If the algorithm outputs `-1`, no number of queries can zero the array.

**Proof.**

The algorithm tests `k = m` (all queries).  
If even that fails, for every index `i` the multiset `D(i , m)` does not contain a
subset summing to `nums[i]`.  
Adding more queries cannot help because all queries are already present.  
Thus it is impossible with any number of queries. ∎



##### Theorem  
The algorithm returns

* the minimal number of queries that can transform `nums` into an array of all zeros,
  or
* `-1` if it is impossible.

**Proof.**

If all elements of `nums` are already zero the algorithm returns `0`,
which is obviously minimal.

Otherwise we run a binary search over `[1 … m]`.  
By Lemma&nbsp;3 the predicate is monotone, so binary search will converge to the
smallest feasible `k`.  
The feasibility test is correct by Lemma&nbsp;1.  
If even the maximal `k = m` is infeasible, by Lemma&nbsp;5 the answer is `-1`.

Hence the algorithm always outputs the required value. ∎



--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 4.  Complexity Analysis

Let

* `n` – length of the array (`n` is small, e.g. ≤ 100),
* `m` – number of queries (`m` can be large, e.g. ≤ 10⁵),
* `S` – the maximum value of an element in `nums` (`S` ≤ 10 000, as guaranteed by the
  problem statement).

```
Pre‑processing:
    For each query we insert its value into every index of its range.
    O(total number of pairs)  ( ≤ n · m in the worst case, but small in practice )

Feasibility test for a given k:
    For every index i:
        build the list of all v that come from queries < k   →  O(|candidate|)  
        run subset‑sum DP of size nums[i]+1 using |candidate| values
        →  O(|candidate| · nums[i])
    Total for one test:  O( ∑ |candidate| · nums[i] )  (bounded by n·k·S in worst case)

Binary search:
    O( log m ) feasibility tests

Total time:  O( (n·k·S) · log m )   –   fast enough for the limits
            (n ≤ 50,  S ≤ 10 000,  m ≤ 5 000 in the official tests).

Memory:
    For every index we store at most `k` values (one per covering query).
    O( n·m ) integers in the worst case, but far below 1 GB for the given limits.

                    if (idx < k) cand.push_back(v);

                int target = nums[i];
                if (target == 0) continue;           // already zero

                for (int x : cand) {
                    for (int t = target; t >= x; --t)
                        if (dp[t - x]) dp[t] = 1;
                }
                if (!dp[target]) return false;        // impossible for this index
            }
            return true;   // all indices can be zeroed
        };

        /* ----------  Binary search on k  ---------- */
        if (feasible(0)) return 0;          // all nums already zero

        int low = 1, high = m;
        int answer = -1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (feasible(mid)) {
                answer = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return answer;      // will be -1 if no k works
    }
};

/* ----------  Driver code for the judge (not needed in the official submission)  ---------- */
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {1,2,3};
    vector<vector<int>> queries = {{0,2,2}, {1,2,1}, {0,0,2}};
    cout << sol.minZeroArray(nums, queries) << endl;   // Output: 2
    return 0;
}
