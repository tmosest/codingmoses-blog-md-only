        ## 1. Problem Recap

**Maximum Containers on a Ship**  
Given an `n x n` cargo deck (maximum `n²` containers) and each container weighs exactly `w`, find the maximum number of containers that can be loaded without exceeding the ship’s `maxWeight` capacity.

*Input* – `n`, `w`, `maxWeight`  
*Output* – the maximum possible container count

The constraints are tiny (`n, w ≤ 1000`, `maxWeight ≤ 10⁹`), so a constant‑time arithmetic solution is all that is required.



--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Intuition

- The deck can hold at most `n²` containers – that’s the *space* limit.
- The ship can only carry a total weight of `maxWeight`.  
  Each container contributes `w`, so at most `maxWeight / w` containers can be carried – that’s the *weight* limit.
- The real answer is the **smaller** of the two limits.

Mathematically:

```
maxContainers = min(n * n, maxWeight / w)
```

Both operations are O(1), so the entire algorithm runs in constant time and uses constant extra memory.



--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Reference Implementations

Below are straightforward, one‑liner implementations in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
All use 64‑bit arithmetic (`long`/`long long`) to avoid overflow when computing `n * n` (since `n ≤ 1000`, `n²` fits in 32‑bit, but the formula is still safe).

| Language | Code |
|----------|------|
| **Java** | ```java<br>public class Solution {<br>    public int maxContainers(int n, int w, int maxWeight) {<br>        long capacity = (long) n * n;            // max containers by space<br>        long weightCap = maxWeight / w;          // max containers by weight<br>        return (int) Math.min(capacity, weightCap);<br>    }<br>}<br>``` |
| **Python** | ```python<br>class Solution:<br>    def maxContainers(self, n: int, w: int, maxWeight: int) -> int:<br>        return min(n * n, maxWeight // w)<br>``` |
| **C++** | ```cpp<br>#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    int maxContainers(int n, int w, int maxWeight) {\n        long long capacity = 1LL * n * n;   // space limit\n        long long weightCap = maxWeight / w; // weight limit\n        return static_cast<int>(min(capacity, weightCap));\n    }\n};\n``` |

All three are **O(1)** in time, **O(1)** in space, and compile with the latest standard compilers.



--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. The One‑Liner

If you want the absolute shortest possible code (typical for coding‑interview “quick‑fire” challenges):

```java
public int maxContainers(int n,int w,int maxWeight){return Math.min(n*n,maxWeight/w);}
```

```python
class Solution: maxContainers=lambda s,n,w,m:max(min(n*n,m//w))
```

```cpp
int maxContainers(int n,int w,int maxWeight){return min(n*n,maxWeight/w);}
```

The logic remains unchanged; we just removed the intermediate variables and comments.

> **Title:** *How to Nail “Maximum Containers on a Ship” and Why It Matters for Your Next Job*  
> **Meta‑Description:** Learn the one‑liner, O(1) solution to LeetCode 3492, with code in Java, Python, and C++. See why this problem is a perfect interview exercise, common pitfalls, and how mastering it boosts your résumé.

---

### 5.1. Why This Problem Is a Gold‑Mine for Interviewers

- **Conceptual Simplicity:** The core idea is just a comparison of two upper bounds (space vs weight). Interviewers love problems that test *clarity of thought* more than algorithmic depth.
- **Constant‑Time Proof:** You can claim “O(1) time, O(1) space.” That’s a quick brag you can confidently use on a résumé.
- **Language Agnosticism:** The same formula works in any language. It demonstrates that you’re not just a “Python person” but can write clean code in Java or C++ too.

### 5.2. The Good

| What | Why it’s great |
|------|----------------|
| **Deterministic result** | No loops, no recursion – you can hand‑write the solution on a whiteboard. |
| **Math‑based** | Shows you can turn a real‑world constraint (weight capacity) into a clean formula. |
| **Cross‑platform** | The same logic works everywhere, a signal that you understand fundamentals over syntax. |

### 5.3. The Bad

| Common Pitfall | Fix |
|----------------|-----|
| Using 32‑bit multiplication `n*n` in Java or C++ can overflow for larger `n` (not the case here, but good habit). | Cast to `long` (`1LL * n * n`) before division. |
| Forgetting integer division truncates in Java/Python. | Always use floor division (`maxWeight / w` in Java, `//` in Python). |
| Over‑optimizing: writing a full class with unused members. | Keep the solution minimal and focused. |

### 5.4. The Ugly

Sometimes interviewers add a twist:

1. **Containers of varying weight** – then you’d need greedy or DP.  
2. **Non‑square deck** – the formula becomes `n*m`.  
3. **Multiple cargo types** – now you’re in multi‑knapsack territory.

If you hit these variants, be honest: “I’ll need a more complex algorithm, but here’s the approach.” That honesty is often appreciated more than a perfect but rushed answer.

### 5.5. SEO‑Optimized Takeaway

When you write your blog post, sprinkle keywords such as:

- “Maximum Containers on a Ship solution”
- “LeetCode 3492 Java Python C++”
- “O(1) interview problem”
- “coding interview best practices”

Add a short “**Quick Code Snippets**” section for each language so search engines catch your content and recruiters reading for a quick fix will find your page.

### 5.6. Final Words

Mastering problems like **Maximum Containers on a Ship** shows recruiters you can:

- Translate constraints into math.
- Write clean, language‑agnostic code.
- Explain the trade‑offs between space and weight (or time and memory).

Pair the solution with a brief blog post that explains *why* the problem matters, and you’ll have a strong talking point for any data‑engineering or backend role. Good luck—and may the containers stay within weight limits! 🚢
