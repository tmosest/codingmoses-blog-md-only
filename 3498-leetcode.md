2. A fully‑commented one‑liner (for those who love brevity).  
3. A **blog‑style deep dive** that talks about the good, the bad, the ugly – plus SEO‑friendly keywords that help you land your next interview.

## 📌 1. Straight‑forward O(n) Solution

The core idea is simple: traverse the string once, compute the reverse alphabet value with `123 - ch` (since `123 – 'a' = 26`, `123 – 'b' = 25`, …, `123 – 'z' = 1`), multiply by the 1‑based index, and accumulate.

### Java

```java
// Java 17+
public class Solution {
    public int reverseDegree(String s) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            // 123 - 'a' = 26, 123 - 'z' = 1
            int reverseVal = 123 - s.charAt(i);
            sum += reverseVal * (i + 1);   // 1‑based position
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseDegree(self, s: str) -> int:
        total = 0
        for idx, ch in enumerate(s, 1):   # enumerate gives 1‑based index
            reverse_val = 123 - ord(ch)
            total += reverse_val * idx
        return total
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reverseDegree(string s) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            int reverse_val = 123 - s[i];   // s[i] is a char, implicitly converted to int
            sum += reverse_val * (i + 1);
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

All three solutions run in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** extra space.

## 🎯 2. One‑liner Versions (for code golf / interviews)

| Language | One‑liner |
|----------|-----------|
| Java  | `public int reverseDegree(String s){int sum=0;for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)sum+=123-s.charAt(i)*(i+1);return sum;}` |
| Python | `class Solution: def reverseDegree(self, s): return sum((123-ord(c))*(i+1) for i,c in enumerate(s,1))` |
| C++ | `int reverseDegree(string s){int sum=0;for(int i=0;i<s.size();++i)sum+=123-s[i]*(i+1);return sum;}` |

> **⚠️** One‑liners sacrifice readability. Use them only when the interview explicitly asks for brevity.

### Introduction

In every interview, LeetCode’s “Easy” problems are a golden testing ground for string manipulation and simple arithmetic. Problem **3498 – Reverse Degree of a String** is a textbook example: *one pass over the string, constant extra memory, and a tiny twist on alphabet indices*.  

Below is a deep‑dive that covers:

- The **core algorithm** and why it’s O(n).  
- **Edge cases** that can trip you up (empty string, max length).  
- **Common pitfalls** in different languages.  
- A quick **one‑liner** for when you’re in a hurry.  
- How to **talk about it in an interview** – what the interviewer really cares about.

### 1️⃣ Problem Re‑Statement

> **Input:** `s` – a string of lowercase English letters (`1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000`).  
> **Output:** Integer representing the reverse degree.

**Reverse degree** = Σ (reverse alphabet value of `s[i]`) × (i + 1), where `i` is 0‑based.

*Reverse alphabet value* is simply `123 - ascii_value_of_char`.  
- `'a'` → `123-97 = 26`  
- `'b'` → `123-98 = 25`  
- …  
- `'z'` → `123-122 = 1`

---

### 2️⃣ Intuition & Step‑by‑Step Walkthrough

| Step | What we do | Why it works |
|------|------------|--------------|
| 1 | Convert each character to its reverse alphabet value. | `123 - ch` gives us `26` for `'a'`, `25` for `'b'`, etc. |
| 2 | Multiply by its 1‑based position. | Problem definition demands position weighting. |
| 3 | Accumulate. | Summation is associative, order doesn’t matter. |

All operations are **constant time** per character, giving us a linear algorithm.

---

### 3️⃣ Implementation Details (Language‑Specific)

#### Java

- Use `charAt(i)` to fetch a character.
- `123 - s.charAt(i)` yields an `int` because `char` is promoted to `int`.
- Multiply by `(i + 1)` to adjust for 1‑based indexing.

#### Python

- `enumerate(s, 1)` gives both the character and a 1‑based index.
- `ord(ch)` returns ASCII code.
- Keep the loop simple – no extra lists or data structures.

#### C++

- Access characters via `s[i]`.
- `123 - s[i]` works because `char` converts to `int`.
- The `sum` variable is `int` – safe up to the constraints (`1000 * 26 * 1000 = 26,000,000 < 2^31`).

---

### 4️⃣ Edge Cases & Pitfalls

| Edge Case | Why It Matters | How to Handle |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Single character** | Position weighting starts at 1. | Works automatically because we use `i+1`. |
| **Maximum length (1000)** | Potential overflow if using 32‑bit? | Sum < 26 * 1000 * 1000 = 26M – fits in signed 32‑bit. |
| **Non‑alphabetic input** | Problem guarantees only lowercase letters. | No validation needed; but defensive programming can check `s.charAt(i) >= 'a' && s.charAt(i) <= 'z'`. |
| **Empty string** | Not allowed by constraints. | If you want to be defensive, return 0. |
| **Large integers in other languages** | JavaScript’s `Number` may lose precision. | Use BigInt if you need to support very long strings (outside constraints). |

---

### 5️⃣ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | What goes wrong | Fix |
|---------|-----------------|-----|
| Using 0‑based position (`i`) instead of `i+1`. | Off‑by‑one error – result too small. | Add 1 to index. |
| Using `s.length()` inside the loop condition and again inside the loop (e.g., `for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)`). | Recomputes length each iteration – harmless for small strings but costly for large ones. | Compute `int n = s.length();` once. |
| Forgetting to cast `char` to `int` before subtraction in C++. | Implicit promotion may lead to signed/unsigned mismatch. | `int reverse_val = 123 - static_cast<int>(s[i]);` |
| Using floating point for sum. | Loss of precision. | Use integer arithmetic only. |

---

### 6️⃣ One‑liner Cheat Sheet

```java
int reverseDegree(String s){int r=0;for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)r+=123-s.charAt(i)*(i+1);return r;}
```

```python
class Solution: def reverseDegree(self, s): return sum((123-ord(c))*(i+1) for i,c in enumerate(s,1))
```

```cpp
int reverseDegree(string s){int r=0;for(int i=0;i<s.size();++i)r+=123-s[i]*(i+1);return r;}
```

> **Pro tip:** Keep the one‑liner in your toolbox for quick coding challenges, but in a real interview, explain each step.  

---

### 7️⃣ Interview‑Ready Explanation

When asked to solve this problem, a good candidate should:

1. **State the problem clearly** – confirm the constraints and the reverse alphabet mapping.
2. **Explain the algorithm** – one pass, O(n) time, O(1) space.
3. **Derive the formula** – show how `123 - ch` works.
4. **Walk through an example** – e.g., `"abc"` → 148.
5. **Discuss edge cases** – empty string, max length, input validation.
6. **Mention complexity** – highlight why it’s efficient.
7. **Offer alternative solutions** – e.g., pre‑compute mapping array or use a dictionary for readability.

> *Why this matters:* Interviewers want to see that you understand **time/space trade‑offs**, can **translate a problem statement into an algorithm**, and can **anticipate pitfalls**.

---

### 8️⃣ Final Thoughts: Good, Bad, Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Algorithm** | Simple, linear, uses built‑in arithmetic. | Might confuse novices with the “reverse alphabet” mapping. | Over‑engineering with hash maps or big‑O proofs for an Easy problem. |
| **Code readability** | Clear variable names (`reverse_val`, `sum`). | One‑liners lose clarity. | Mixing languages – a C++ solution that returns `long long` while the rest use `int`. |
| **Edge‑case handling** | Defensive checks add robustness. | Ignoring constraints may lead to subtle bugs. | Failing to consider integer overflow for longer inputs. |
| **Interview talk** | Explain each step, use examples. | Just drop the code. | Rush into coding without reasoning – makes you appear unprepared. |
