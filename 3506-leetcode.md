        ## 1. Code – 3506 – Find Time Required to Eliminate Bacterial Strains  

The task is a classic “combine‑two‑smallest” problem – exactly the same strategy used in Huffman coding.  
At each step we pick the two quickest WBC tasks, merge them by adding the split time, and push the
new “combined” task back into the pool.  
When only one task remains it represents the minimum total time needed to finish everything.

Below you’ll find clean, production‑ready solutions in **Python 3**, **Java 17**, and **C++17**.  
All three use a *min‑heap* (priority queue) for an `O(n log n)` time and `O(n)` space complexity.

### 1.1 Python 3

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minEliminationTime(self, timeReq: List[int], splitTime: int) -> int:
        """
        Combines the two smallest tasks repeatedly until only one task is left.
        Equivalent to building an optimal binary tree (Huffman).
        """
        # turn the list into a min‑heap
        heapq.heapify(timeReq)

        # keep merging until we have only one element
        while len(timeReq) > 1:
            t1 = heapq.heappop(timeReq)          # smallest
            t2 = heapq.heappop(timeReq)          # second smallest
            combined = max(t1, t2) + splitTime   # WBC splits once, kills max(t1, t2)
            heapq.heappush(timeReq, combined)    # put the combined task back

        return timeReq[0]   # the only remaining element is the answer
```

---

### 1.2 Java 17

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Collections;

class Solution {
    public long minEliminationTime(int[] timeReq, int splitTime) {
        // use a min‑heap (PriorityQueue with natural ordering)
        PriorityQueue<Long> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int t : timeReq) {
            pq.offer((long) t);
        }

        while (pq.size() > 1) {
            long t1 = pq.poll();            // smallest
            long t2 = pq.poll();            // second smallest
            long combined = Math.max(t1, t2) + splitTime;
            pq.offer(combined);
        }

        // only one element remains
        return pq.peek();
    }
}
```

> **Why `long`?**  
> The worst case sum can be up to `10^9 + 10^9 + ...` (≈ `10^14`), which fits in a 64‑bit `long` but not in a 32‑bit `int`.

---

### 1.3 C++17

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long minEliminationTime(vector<int>& timeReq, int splitTime) {
        // min‑heap using greater comparator
        priority_queue<long long, vector<long long>, greater<long long>> pq;
        for (int t : timeReq) pq.push(static_cast<long long>(t));

        while (pq.size() > 1) {
            long long t1 = pq.top(); pq.pop();          // smallest
            long long t2 = pq.top(); pq.pop();          // second smallest
            long long combined = max(t1, t2) + splitTime;
            pq.push(combined);
        }
        return pq.top();   // the only remaining element
    }
};
```

### 2.1 Introduction

In 2025, the LeetCode “Find Time Required to Eliminate Bacterial Strains” (ID 3506) surfaced as a hard‑level interview challenge.  
The problem may sound biologically themed, but at its core it’s a classic algorithmic puzzle: **merge the two shortest tasks until only one remains**.  
Understanding this puzzle is crucial for any software engineer preparing for coding interviews, especially those targeting system‑design or algorithm‑heavy roles.

---

### 2.2 Problem Restatement

- **Input**:  
  - `timeReq[ ]` – array of integers, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵`, each `1 ≤ timeReq[i] ≤ 10⁹`.  
  - `splitTime` – integer, `1 ≤ splitTime ≤ 10⁹`.

- **Scenario**:  
  - A single white blood cell (WBC) starts.  
  - A WBC can kill **one** bacterial strain (time equals `timeReq[i]`).  
  - After killing, the WBC is exhausted.  
  - A WBC can *split* into two WBCs at the cost of `splitTime`.  
  - After splitting, the two WBCs work in parallel.

- **Goal**: Minimize the total time needed to eliminate **all** bacterial strains.

### 2.3 Why Huffman Coding? The *Good* Solution

The optimal strategy is identical to building a Huffman tree:

1. **Always merge the two smallest tasks**.  
2. Add the split cost once for the new “combined” task.  
3. Repeat until one task remains.

> **Why it works**  
> The combined task’s finish time equals the maximum of its two children plus the split time – just like the depth of a node in a binary tree.  
> By always merging the smallest tasks, we keep the tree as balanced as possible, minimizing the overall finish time.

#### Algorithm Steps

```text
heap = min‑heap of all times
while heap has > 1 element:
    a = pop smallest
    b = pop second smallest
    newTime = max(a, b) + splitTime
    push newTime back
answer = only element left
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)` – each of the `n-1` merges performs two `pop` and one `push` on a heap.  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` – the heap stores all intermediate times.  
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - All `timeReq` equal → the algorithm still balances the tree.  
  - `splitTime` huge → the algorithm naturally pushes the split cost into the final answer.

The clean implementation in Python (`heapq`), Java (`PriorityQueue`), and C++ (`priority_queue` with `greater`) shows mastery of data structures and demonstrates your ability to translate a theoretical optimum into code.

### 2.4 When Greedy Fails – The *Bad* Approaches

Many coders try a “pick the smallest, kill it, split, repeat” loop.  
This **looks** greedy but **doesn’t** account for parallelism correctly.

#### Common Mistake

```python
while queue:
    t = pop_smallest()
    # kill t
    split once
    # ... incorrectly assume next task starts after kill
```

- **Why it fails**:  
  After the first kill, a new WBC is created only if a split happens.  
  Failing to merge two tasks simultaneously ignores the *parallel* nature and can produce an answer up to twice as large.

#### Proof by Counterexample

Let `timeReq = [1, 2, 100]`, `splitTime = 1`.

- Wrong greedy:  
  1. Kill strain 1 (`1 s`).  
  2. Split (`+1 s`).  
  3. Kill strain 2 (`2 s`).  
  4. Split (`+1 s`).  
  5. Kill strain 3 (`100 s`).  
  **Total** = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 100 = 105 s.

- Optimal:  
  1. Merge 1 & 2 → combined = `max(1,2)+1 = 3`.  
  2. Merge 3 & 100 → combined = `max(3,100)+1 = 101`.  
  **Total** = 101 s.

The greedy method was 4 s slower – unacceptable in a “hard” interview.

### 2.5 The *Ugly* Part – Dealing with Large Numbers & Overflow

Because `timeReq[i]` and `splitTime` can each be up to `10⁹`, the cumulative sum can easily exceed 32‑bit integer limits (`≈ 10¹⁴`).  
If you use 32‑bit `int` in Java or `int` in C++, you’ll encounter integer overflow, producing wrong answers on the test harness.

**Fix**:  
- Use `long` (`int64_t` in C++, `long` in Java) to hold intermediate sums.  
- In Python, `int` is already arbitrary precision, so it’s safe.

### 2.6 Practical Interview Advice

| Skill | How the Problem Tests It | How to Show It in Your Resume |
|-------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Greedy reasoning** | Choosing the two smallest tasks is the optimal move. | Mention “Huffman‑like merging” in your cover letter or portfolio. |
| **Data‑structure knowledge** | Requires a *min‑heap* (priority queue). | Highlight usage of `heapq`, `PriorityQueue`, or `priority_queue` in your projects. |
| **Time‑space trade‑offs** | `O(n log n)` solution is needed for 10⁵ elements. | Add a “Complexity Analysis” section to any algorithm post. |
| **Edge‑case handling** | Large values, overflow, duplicate times. | Demonstrate robust type handling (`long`/`int64_t`) in your code. |
| **Testing** | Stress‑test on random inputs, edge cases. | Use unit tests to show you can catch subtle bugs before interviews. |

**Job‑Interview Tip**: When discussing this problem, emphasize that the solution is *not* a simulation of biology but an *optimal binary tree construction*. That level of abstraction signals strong algorithmic thinking.

### 2.7 Conclusion – Why 3506 Is a Must‑Know

- **The Good**: Huffman‑style merging gives a clean, optimal `O(n log n)` solution.  
- **The Bad**: Naïve greedy or simulation approaches break the parallel split rule and produce sub‑optimal times.  
- **The Ugly**: Forgetting 64‑bit arithmetic leads to silent overflow – a subtle bug that interviewers love to spot.

Mastering LeetCode 3506 demonstrates your ability to:

- Translate a real‑world scenario into a mathematical model.  
- Choose the right data structure (min‑heap).  
- Reason rigorously about optimality (Huffman coding).  
- Pay attention to edge cases (overflow, large constraints).  

All of these are exactly the skills recruiters look for in senior software engineers and technical leads.

Good luck landing that job – your next interview might just be a *white‑blood‑cell* problem!
