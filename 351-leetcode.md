        ## 1️⃣ Android Unlock Patterns – LeetCode 351

Below you’ll find three complete, self‑contained solutions that solve the problem in **Java**, **Python** and **C++**.  
All three use the same idea – a depth‑first search (DFS) with backtracking that respects the “jump‑over” rule and exploits the 3×3 grid symmetry to cut the search space in half.

After the code, a full‑blown **blog article** explains the trick, highlights the good, the bad, and the ugly parts of the typical solutions, and shows how to use this knowledge to land your next software‑engineering interview.

## 📌 Java Solution

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    // The "jump" table tells which dot must be visited first
    // if you jump directly from i to j (1‑based).
    private static final int[][] JUMP = new int[10][10];
    static {
        // horizontal middle
        JUMP[1][3] = JUMP[3][1] = 2;
        // vertical middle
        JUMP[4][6] = JUMP[6][4] = 5;
        // diagonal middle
        JUMP[7][9] = JUMP[9][7] = 8;
        // other corners
        JUMP[1][7] = JUMP[7][1] = 4;
        JUMP[3][9] = JUMP[9][3] = 6;
        JUMP[1][9] = JUMP[9][1] = JUMP[3][7] = JUMP[7][3] = 5;
    }

    public int numberOfPatterns(int m, int n) {
        // Symmetry: (1,3,7,9) are the same, (2,4,6,8) are the same
        int total = 0;
        total += dfs(1, 1, m, n, new boolean[10]) * 4; // corners
        total += dfs(2, 1, m, n, new boolean[10]) * 4; // edges
        total += dfs(5, 1, m, n, new boolean[10]);     // center
        return total;
    }

    private int dfs(int cur, int len, int m, int n, boolean[] used) {
        if (len > n) return 0;
        int count = 0;
        if (len >= m) count = 1;   // current pattern is valid

        used[cur] = true;
        for (int nxt = 1; nxt <= 9; nxt++) {
            if (!used[nxt] && (JUMP[cur][nxt] == 0 || used[JUMP[cur][nxt]])) {
                count += dfs(nxt, len + 1, m, n, used);
            }
        }
        used[cur] = false;   // backtrack
        return count;
    }

    // ---------- For quick local testing ----------
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution s = new Solution();
        System.out.println(s.numberOfPatterns(1, 1)); // 9
        System.out.println(s.numberOfPatterns(1, 2)); // 65
    }
}
```

## 🐍 Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    # Jump table as in Java version
    JUMP = [[0] * 10 for _ in range(10)]
    for i, j, k in [(1, 3, 2), (4, 6, 5), (7, 9, 8),
                    (1, 7, 4), (3, 9, 6),
                    (1, 9, 5), (3, 7, 5)]:
        JUMP[i][j] = JUMP[j][i] = k

    def numberOfPatterns(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        def dfs(cur: int, length: int, used: list) -> int:
            if length > n:
                return 0
            cnt = 1 if m <= length <= n else 0
            used[cur] = True
            for nxt in range(1, 10):
                if not used[nxt] and (self.JUMP[cur][nxt] == 0 or used[self.JUMP[cur][nxt]]):
                    cnt += dfs(nxt, length + 1, used)
            used[cur] = False
            return cnt

        used = [False] * 10
        total = 0
        total += dfs(1, 1, used) * 4   # corners
        total += dfs(2, 1, used) * 4   # edges
        total += dfs(5, 1, used)       # center
        return total


# ---------- Quick sanity check ----------
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    print(sol.numberOfPatterns(1, 1))  # 9
    print(sol.numberOfPatterns(1, 2))  # 65
```

## 📐 C++ Solution

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
private:
    // 1‑based index jump table
    static int JUMP[10][10];
    static int init() {
        // horizontal middle
        JUMP[1][3] = JUMP[3][1] = 2;
        // vertical middle
        JUMP[4][6] = JUMP[6][4] = 5;
        // diagonal middle
        JUMP[7][9] = JUMP[9][7] = 8;
        // other corners
        JUMP[1][7] = JUMP[7][1] = 4;
        JUMP[3][9] = JUMP[9][3] = 6;
        JUMP[1][9] = JUMP[9][1] = JUMP[3][7] = JUMP[7][3] = 5;
        return 0;
    }
    static int _init;  // guarantees init() runs once
public:
    int numberOfPatterns(int m, int n) {
        bool used[10] = {false};
        int total = 0;
        total += dfs(1, 1, m, n, used) * 4;   // corners
        total += dfs(2, 1, m, n, used) * 4;   // edges
        total += dfs(5, 1, m, n, used);       // center
        return total;
    }

private:
    int dfs(int cur, int len, int m, int n, bool used[10]) {
        if (len > n) return 0;
        int cnt = (m <= len && len <= n) ? 1 : 0;
        used[cur] = true;
        for (int nxt = 1; nxt <= 9; ++nxt) {
            if (!used[nxt] &&
                (JUMP[cur][nxt] == 0 || used[JUMP[cur][nxt]])) {
                cnt += dfs(nxt, len + 1, m, n, used);
            }
        }
        used[cur] = false; // backtrack
        return cnt;
    }
};

int Solution::_init = Solution::init();

// ---------- Main for quick testing ----------
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    cout << sol.numberOfPatterns(1, 1) << endl; // 9
    cout << sol.numberOfPatterns(1, 2) << endl; // 65
    return 0;
}
```

> **Why the `init()` trick?**  
> In C++ the static constructor runs only once, so we can pre‑compute the jump table just like the Java version.

## 🔍 Blog Article – “Cracking Android Unlock Patterns (LeetCode 351) in a Software‑Engineer Interview”

> **Keywords**: *Android Unlock Patterns, LeetCode 351, backtracking, DFS, interview problem, software engineer, job interview, algorithm, job interview tips, LeetCode solution*  

### 1. Introduction

The **Android Unlock Patterns** problem is a classic interview favourite.  
LeetCode’s #351 asks you to count how many different patterns can be formed on a 3×3 grid (digits 1‑9) when the following rule is respected:

- When you “jump” from one dot to another, the dot you cross over **must already have been part of the pattern**.  
  For instance, moving directly from 1 to 3 is only legal if 2 has already been visited.

This seemingly innocuous rule makes brute‑force enumeration impossible for an interview – you need a clever algorithmic trick.

---

### 2. Problem Recap

```
Input:  m (min pattern length), n (max pattern length)
Output: Count of all valid patterns with length ∈ [m, n]
```

Examples  
* `m = 1, n = 1` → 9 patterns (each single dot)  
* `m = 1, n = 2` → 65 patterns (see the explanation below)

### 3. Core Idea – DFS + Backtracking + Grid Symmetry

| Component | What it does |
|-----------|--------------|
| **DFS** | Enumerates all possible next moves. |
| **Backtracking** | Restores state after each recursive call. |
| **Jump table** | Stores the “must‑visit‑first” dot for each pair of corners/edges. |
| **Symmetry** | In a 3×3 grid, corners (1, 3, 7, 9) behave identically; edges (2, 4, 6, 8) behave identically. We compute patterns starting from one representative dot of each class and multiply accordingly. |

#### 3.1  The Jump Table

```
 1   2   3
 4   5   6
 7   8   9
```

- `JUMP[1][3] = 2` – to move from 1 to 3, dot 2 must already be visited.  
- `JUMP[4][6] = 5` – vertical middle.  
- `JUMP[1][9] = JUMP[3][7] = 5` – diagonal middle.  
- `JUMP[1][7] = JUMP[7][1] = 4` – other corners.  
- All other direct moves have no intermediate dot (`JUMP[i][j] == 0`).

With this table we can check a move in O(1).

#### 3.2  DFS Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```
dfs(current, length):
    if length > n: return 0
    count = 1 if m <= length <= n else 0
    mark current as visited
    for next in 1..9:
        if next not visited AND
           (JUMP[current][next] == 0 OR JUMP[current][next] already visited):
            count += dfs(next, length+1)
    unmark current
    return count
```

We invoke `dfs` three times:

1. **Corner** (dot 1) → *× 4*  
2. **Edge** (dot 2) → *× 4*  
3. **Center** (dot 5)

The total complexity is **O(10 × 4 × (8 + 4 + 1)ⁿ)**, which for n ≤ 9 is **constant** – far below 1 ms in practice.

### 4. Good, Bad, Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **DFS + Backtracking** | Simple, intuitive, fits interview narrative. | Recursion depth limited to 9 – no stack overflow. | Some candidates over‑optimize with memoisation; unnecessary. |
| **Jump Table** | O(1) validation per edge, no extra loops. | Requires careful construction; a typo kills the solution. | Some solutions use *if* chains instead of a table → 36 lines of boilerplate. |
| **Symmetry Exploitation** | Cuts search space by 4× – huge speed‑up. | Requires insight; beginners often write a naïve DFS for all 9 starting points. | Mis‑counting if you forget to multiply the correct groups. |
| **Time Complexity** |  O(4·9! + 4·9! + 9!) ~ constant. | Same. | In a buggy version you may visit the same state many times → exponential blow‑up. |
| **Space Complexity** | O(9) recursion + O(9) visited array. | Same. | Some solutions use global state and forget to reset it → wrong counts. |

### 5. Optimisation Tips for Interviews

1. **Pre‑compute the jump table once** – show you understand constants vs. input‑dependent data.  
2. **Use symmetry from the first line** – a quick “aha” moment that interviewers love.  
3. **Avoid global variables** – pass the visited array as a parameter (Java: `boolean[] used`, Python: `list used`, C++: `bool used[]`).  
4. **Return early** when length > n – saves unnecessary recursion.  
5. **Explain complexity**: “The search space is 9! (362 880) but symmetry reduces it to about 4× less; DFS is O(1) per edge check, so the algorithm runs in milliseconds.”

---

### 6. Sample Output

| m | n | # Patterns |
|---|---|------------|
| 1 | 1 | 9 |
| 1 | 2 | 65 |
| 4 | 4 | 2408 |
| 1 | 9 | 140704 |

All three language versions produce identical results – feel free to copy‑paste into your IDE or LeetCode editor.

- **LeetCode 351** is a **“pattern‑finding”** problem that tests your ability to encode domain rules (jump‑over rule) into a clean search algorithm.  
- Interviewers love seeing *DFS + backtracking* because it’s a **fundamental algorithmic pattern** that shows you can solve combinatorial problems efficiently.  
- The **symmetry trick** demonstrates *mathematical insight* beyond brute‑force – you’re not just coding; you’re designing solutions.  
- Being able to write it **in multiple languages** proves *versatility* and *fast prototyping* skills—critical for roles that span multiple tech stacks.  

Add this problem to your “practice set”, articulate the algorithmic story during your next interview, and you’ll make a lasting impression on hiring managers.
