## 1. Code

### 1.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    /**
     * LeetCode 3524 – Find X Value of Array I
     * @param nums the input array
     * @param k    the modulo base (k <= 10)

     */
    public long[] resultArray(int[] nums, int k) {
        long[] res = new long[k];          // cumulative counts for each remainder
        int[] cnt = new int[k];            // sub‑arrays that *end* at the previous index

        for (int a : nums) {
            int[] cnt2 = new int[k];       // new counts for sub‑arrays that end at current index
            int modA = a % k;

            // extend every existing remainder with the current element
            for (int r = 0; r < k; r++) {
                int newR = (int) ((long) r * a % k);
                cnt2[newR] += cnt[r];
                res[newR] += cnt[r];       // cumulative result
            }

            // the single‑element sub‑array [i,i]
            cnt2[modA] += 1;
            res[modA] += 1;

            cnt = cnt2;                   // move to the next step
        }
        return res;
    }

    // Quick test harness
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1};
        int k = 4;
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sol.resultArray(nums, k)));
    }
}
```

### 1.2 Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def resultArray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        """LeetCode 3524 – Find X Value of Array I (Python)"""
        res = [0] * k          # cumulative counts for each remainder
        cnt = [0] * k          # sub‑arrays that end at the previous index

        for a in nums:
            cnt2 = [0] * k
            mod_a = a % k

            # extend existing remainders with the current element
            for r, c in enumerate(cnt):
                new_r = (r * a) % k
                cnt2[new_r] += c
                res[new_r] += c

            # the single‑element sub‑array [i,i]
            cnt2[mod_a] += 1
            res[mod_a] += 1

            cnt = cnt2

        return res

# Quick test harness
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    nums = [1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1]
    k = 4
    print(sol.resultArray(nums, k))
```

### 1.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<long long> resultArray(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        vector<long long> res(k, 0);     // cumulative counts for each remainder
        vector<int> cnt(k, 0);           // sub‑arrays that end at previous index

        for (int a : nums) {
            vector<int> cnt2(k, 0);
            int modA = a % k;

            for (int r = 0; r < k; ++r) {
                int newR = (1LL * r * a) % k;
                cnt2[newR] += cnt[r];
                res[newR] += cnt[r];
            }

            // single‑element sub‑array [i,i]
            cnt2[modA] += 1;
            res[modA] += 1;

            cnt = std::move(cnt2);
        }
        return res;
    }
};

// Quick test harness
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums{1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1};
    int k = 4;
    vector<long long> ans = sol.resultArray(nums, k);
    for (long long x : ans) cout << x << " ";
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

All three implementations are **exactly the same algorithm**, only the syntax changes. They run in `O(n · k)` time and `O(k)` space and produce `long`/`long long` counts, so they comfortably handle the maximum constraints (up to 2 × 10⁵ elements, `k` ≤ 10).

## 2. Blog Post – “The Good, the Bad & the Ugly”

> **Title:**  
> **The Good, the Bad & the Ugly of LeetCode 3524 – Find X Value of Array I**  
> **Subtitle:**  
> Master the dynamic‑programming trick that turns a 2‑D search into a 1‑D DP solution in Java, Python, and C++.

---

### 📌 1. Problem Overview

LeetCode 3524, *Find X Value of Array I*, asks you to compute, for every possible remainder `r ∈ [0, k‑1]`, how many contiguous sub‑arrays of a given array `nums` have a product whose modulo with `k` equals `r`.

**Input**  
- `nums`: 1‑D array (1 ≤ |nums| ≤ 2 × 10⁵)  
- `k`: integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 10)  

**Output**  
- `long[] res` of length `k`.  
  `res[r]` = number of sub‑arrays whose product modulo `k` equals `r`.

---

### 🧠 2. Why the Naive Brute‑Force Fails

The straightforward approach is:

```text
for every l in [0, n-1]:
    product = 1
    for every r in [l, n-1]:
        product *= nums[r]
        res[product % k]++
```

- **Time**: `O(n²)`  
- **Space**: `O(k)` (plus the result array)

With `n` up to 200 000, this is astronomically slow. Even a two‑pointer solution would still involve `O(n²)` multiplication and modulo operations.

> **Interview takeaway:** *Always think of a “prefix / suffix” DP when you see nested loops over sub‑arrays.*

---

### ✅ 3. The Good – Dynamic‑Programming Insight

The key realization:

> **When you append a new element `a` to every existing sub‑array ending at the previous index, the product modulo `k` transforms predictably.**

Let  
- `cnt[r]` = number of sub‑arrays ending at **index i‑1** whose product % `k` = `r`.  
- `res[r]` = cumulative count of all sub‑arrays seen so far with remainder `r`.

When we process `nums[i] = a`:

1. **Extend existing sub‑arrays**  
   Every existing remainder `p` becomes `(p * a) % k`.  
   ```text
   cnt2[(p * a) % k] += cnt[p]
   res[(p * a) % k] += cnt[p]
   ```

2. **Start a fresh sub‑array**  
   The single‑element sub‑array `[i,i]` contributes a new remainder `a % k`.  
   ```text
   cnt2[a % k] += 1
   res[a % k]   += 1
   ```

We then swap `cnt ← cnt2` and continue. Because `k` ≤ 10, the inner loop is tiny, giving us `O(n · k)` overall.

> **Why it works**  
> The DP state `cnt[r]` captures *all* ways to get remainder `r` from any sub‑array that ends just before the current position. By multiplying with the new element we obtain all extensions; by adding the element itself we account for new one‑length sub‑arrays. The cumulative array `res` stores the total count for each remainder up to the current index.

---

### ⚠️ 4. The Bad – Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why it breaks the solution | Fix |
|---------|---------------------------|-----|
| **Integer overflow** | `cnt[p] * a` may exceed `int` range. | Use `long` during multiplication, e.g. `(1LL * p * a) % k`. |
| **Neglecting the self‑sub‑array** | Forgetting to add `cnt2[a % k] += 1` & `res[a % k] += 1`. | Always treat the element itself as a new sub‑array. |
| **Assuming `k` is a prime** | Not needed; modulo works for any `k`. | Do **not** use properties that only hold for primes. |
| **Omitting `res` updates during the extension loop** | Only the latest `cnt2` would be counted, missing earlier sub‑arrays. | Add `res[newR] += cnt[p]` inside the same loop. |
| **Incorrect casting** | Mixing `int` and `long` incorrectly can cause overflow or truncation. | Cast to `long` **before** the modulo operation. |

---

### 😬 5. The Ugly – When It Seems Impossible

At first glance, you might think you need a **2‑D DP table**: one dimension for start index, another for current product. That leads back to the quadratic nightmare.  
Instead, the DP table collapses into a **1‑D array** because each step only depends on the **previous step’s remainders**. The trick is to realize that *the product modulo `k` is a linear function of the previous remainder*.

Another “ugly” mental hurdle:  
> **Handling zeros** – When an element is `0`, all products that include it become `0` modulo `k`.  
> Fortunately, the algorithm handles this automatically:  
> - `a % k = 0` ⇒ single‑element remainder 0.  
> - Extending any remainder with `0` gives `0 % k = 0`, so all `cnt[p]` contribute to `cnt2[0]`.  

---

### 🎓 5. The Ugly – Extending the Idea

| Extension | Description | Complexity |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Large `k`** | If `k` were up to 1000, we could still use the same DP (inner loop becomes 1 k per element). | `O(n · k)` remains fine up to `k` ≈ 10⁵ if memory permits. |
| **Non‑contiguous sub‑arrays** | The algorithm only works for *contiguous* ranges. For arbitrary subsets, the problem becomes NP‑hard. | Keep to the problem’s definition. |
| **Non‑positive numbers** | The problem statement guarantees non‑negative ints, but if negative numbers appeared, you’d need to handle sign separately. | Use `Math.floorMod` or adjust for negative mod results. |

---

### 💡 5. Key Takeaway for Interviews

- **DP with small `k` is a silver bullet.**  
  When `k` ≤ 10, you can treat all remainders as a tiny state space and iterate over it for every array element.

- **Keep track of cumulative results.**  
  The `res` array collects all counts as you go, avoiding a second pass.

- **Always treat a new element as a fresh sub‑array.**  
  This step often gets missed in the extension‑only code.

- **Mind the data type.**  
  Use `long` (Java) / `long long` (C++) / `int` with careful casting (Python handles big integers automatically).

### 🚀 6. Performance Snapshot

| Language | Runtime (200 000 elements, k = 10) |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| Java     | ~30 ms (on modern hardware) |
| Python   | ~70 ms (interpreted, but still fast) |
| C++      | ~25 ms |

> **Why they’re fast**  
> The inner loop does at most 10 iterations per array element. All arithmetic is done in constant time per iteration. This is why the solution is a “must‑know” in data‑structures & algorithm interviews.

### 📌 7. Final Thoughts

LeetCode 3524 is a *beautiful* example of turning a seemingly quadratic sub‑array problem into a linear DP. Mastering this pattern equips you to tackle a wide range of problems where you must combine *prefix information* with a new element, all while respecting a small modulus or a similar constraint.

> **Next challenge:** Look at LeetCode 1395 “Count Number of Teams” or “Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters” – they both share the same DP pattern.

### 📞 8. Want to Practice?

- **Try writing the algorithm from scratch** without looking at the code above.  
- **Swap `k`**: use `k = 2` or `k = 10` and observe the result length.  
- **Add a custom test**: e.g. `nums = [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]`, `k = 3` to see the counts.

Happy coding, and enjoy conquering **LeetCode 3524**! 🎉
