## 1. Problem Recap

```
minTravelTime(l, n, k, position[], time[])
```

* `l` – length of the road (km).  
* `n` – number of signs (`position.length == n`).
* `k` – *exactly* `k` merge operations must be performed.  
* `position[i]` – strictly increasing, `position[0] = 0`, `position[n‑1] = l`.  
* `time[i]` – minutes per km on the segment `[position[i], position[i+1])`.

**Merge operation**  
Choose two adjacent signs `i` and `i+1` (`i>0 && i+1<n`), remove sign `i` and set

```
time[i+1] = time[i] + time[i+1]
```

After `k` merges the road is split into fewer segments.  
Return the minimum possible total travel time (minutes) from 0 to `l`.

```
Constraints
------------
1 ≤ l ≤ 10^5
2 ≤ n ≤ min(l+1, 50)
0 ≤ k ≤ min(n-2, 10)
1 ≤ time[i] ≤ 100
```

The problem is a classic **interval DP** – the cost of a segment depends on how many
previous merges were performed, and each merge “merges” two adjacent segments into one.



---

## 2. High‑Level Idea

* **Prefix sums of `time`** – allow us to obtain the total rate of any interval in `O(1)`.  
  If the last remaining sign is `last` and we are at sign `i`, the combined rate for the
  segment `[position[last], position[i])` is

  ```
  rate = prefix[i] – (last>0 ? prefix[last-1] : 0)
  ```

* **Recursive DP** with memoisation  
  *State* :  
  `solve(kLeft, i, last)` – minimal travel time from sign `i` to the end,
  having `kLeft` merges still available and the *previous* kept sign is `last`.

  *Transition* :  
  We can decide to **keep** sign `i` and then jump to any later sign `j`
  (`i+1 ≤ j ≤ min(n-1, i+kLeft+1)` – we can never skip more than `kLeft+1` signs).
  The cost of travelling from `i` to `j` using the current combined rate is

  ```
  dist * rate
  ```

  After moving to `j` we lose `j-i-1` merges (those were merged away when we jumped over
  the intermediate signs).

  ```
  temp = dist * rate + solve(kLeft-(j-i-1), j, i+1)
  ```

  Take the minimum over all possible `j`.

* **Base case**  
  When `i` is the last sign (`i == n-1`) we are already at the end –  
  the cost is 0 *iff* all `k` merges have been used (`kLeft==0`), otherwise it is
  impossible and we return “infinity”.

* The recursion depth is tiny (`n≤50, k≤10`), so recursion with memoisation is fast.

## 3. Complexity

| Implementation | Time | Memory |
|----------------|------|--------|
| 3‑D recursive memoisation | **O(n · k · n)**  (≈ 50 · 10 · 50 ≈ 25 000) | **O(n · k · n)** |
| Iterative DP (bottom‑up) – same asymptotic cost | **O(n · k · n)** | **O(n · k · n)** |

With the given limits the solution runs comfortably under 10 ms in every language.

## 3. Reference Implementations

Below are clean, self‑contained solutions in **Java, Python, and C++** that follow the same
idea.  All three use memoisation and the prefix‑sum trick.

> **NOTE** – the code is intentionally written for interview readability;  
> if you need the fastest possible implementation you can replace the memoised
> recursion by an iterative 3‑D DP that builds the table from the back.



### 3.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    // dp[kLeft][i][last]   -1  means “not computed yet”
    private int[][][] dp;
    private int[] positions;
    private int[] prefix;        // prefix sum of time[]
    private int n;

    public int minTravelTime(int l, int n, int k, int[] position, int[] time) {
        this.n = n;
        this.positions = position;

        // build prefix sums of time[]
        this.prefix = new int[n];
        prefix[0] = time[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + time[i];

        // dp[kLeft][i][last]  (kLeft up to 10, i up to 50, last up to 50)
        dp = new int[11][n][n];
        for (int[][] a : dp)
            for (int[] b : a)
                Arrays.fill(b, -1);

        // we start from sign 0, last remaining sign is also 0
        return solve(k, 0, 0);
    }

    private int solve(int kLeft, int i, int last) {
        if (i == n - 1) {               // we are at the last sign – no more segments
            return kLeft == 0 ? 0 : INF; // must have used exactly k merges
        }

        if (dp[kLeft][i][last] != -1) return dp[kLeft][i][last];

        int rate = prefix[i] - (last > 0 ? prefix[last-1] : 0);
        int ans = INF;

        // we may jump to any later sign j, but we cannot use more than kLeft merges
        int maxJump = Math.min(n - 1, i + kLeft + 1);
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= maxJump; j++) {
            int dist = positions[j] - positions[i];
            int cost = dist * rate + solve(kLeft - (j - i - 1), j, i + 1);
            ans = Math.min(ans, cost);
        }

        dp[kLeft][i][last] = ans;
        return ans;
    }

    private static final int INF = 1_000_000_000;
}
```

### 3.2 Python

```python
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

def minTravelTime(l, n, k, position, time):
    prefix = [0] * n
    prefix[0] = time[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + time[i]

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def solve(k_left, i, last):
        if i == n - 1:                     # reached the end
            return 0 if k_left == 0 else 10**9

        rate = prefix[i] - (prefix[last-1] if last > 0 else 0)
        ans = 10**9

        # we can jump to any later sign j
        max_jump = min(n - 1, i + k_left + 1)
        for j in range(i + 1, max_jump + 1):
            dist = position[j] - position[i]
            cost = dist * rate + solve(k_left - (j - i - 1), j, i + 1)
            ans = min(ans, cost)

        return ans

    return solve(k, 0, 0)
```

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int INF = 1e9;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<vector<int>>> memo;  // memo[k_left][i][last]
    vector<int> pos, pref;
    int n;

    int solve(int k_left, int i, int last) {
        if (i == n - 1)                // end reached
            return (k_left == 0) ? 0 : INF;

        int &ret = memo[k_left][i][last];
        if (ret != -1) return ret;

        int rate = pref[i] - (last > 0 ? pref[last - 1] : 0);
        ret = INF;

        int max_jump = min(n - 1, i + k_left + 1);
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= max_jump; ++j) {
            int dist = pos[j] - pos[i];
            int cost = dist * rate + solve(k_left - (j - i - 1), j, i + 1);
            ret = min(ret, cost);
        }
        return ret;
    }

    int minTravelTime(int l, int n, int k, vector<int>& position, vector<int>& time) {
        this->n = n;
        pos = position;
        pref.resize(n);
        pref[0] = time[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) pref[i] = pref[i-1] + time[i];

        memo.assign(k + 1, vector<vector<int>>(n, vector<int>(n, -1)));
        return solve(k, 0, 0);
    }
};
```

> All three solutions share the **same idea**:  
> *prefix sum → quick rate lookup* + *3‑D DP over (remaining merges, current index, last kept sign)*.  
> The recursion guarantees that every possible merge pattern is considered exactly once.

> **Title**: *Merge Operations for Minimum Travel Time – The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (Interview Prep)*  
> **Meta‑description**: *Learn how to crack the “Merge Operations for Minimum Travel Time” problem, see the DP trick that turns a hard interval problem into a clean 3‑D recursion, and get ready to impress interviewers.*

---

### 3.1 The Good – Why This Problem is a “Nice” Interview Question

| Aspect | Why It’s Good |
|--------|---------------|
| **Clear, bounded constraints** | `n ≤ 50` and `k ≤ 10` → brute‑force recursion with memoisation is *easily* feasible. |
| **Single‑source shortest‑path style** | The cost of travelling from one sign to another only depends on the *combined rate* of the segment. |
| **Reveals DP intuition** | Candidates must recognise that each merge changes the rate of *future* segments. |
| **No special data‑structures needed** | A simple 3‑D array suffices – great for “clean code” interviews. |
| **Good teaching moment** | The problem demonstrates how *prefix sums* can turn a seemingly quadratic cost into `O(1)`. |

> **Take‑away**: The DP is *not* a trick question – it’s a *classic* interval DP that any good software engineer should understand.



### 3.2 The Bad – Things That Make It Tricky

| Pitfall | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Merges are “exactly” `k`** | Forgetting to enforce `k` → wrong answer or “infinite” paths. |
| **Wrong state definition** | Using only `(k_left, i)` and ignoring the “last kept sign” leads to double‑counting or missing patterns. |
| **Over‑jumping too far** | Choosing `j` beyond `i + k_left + 1` can create impossible states that must be pruned. |
| **Recursive depth bugs** | In languages with shallow recursion limits (e.g. Python), one must set a higher recursion limit or switch to iterative DP. |
| **Infinity handling** | Using `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and adding to it can overflow – always use a safe sentinel (`INF`). |

> These “bad” parts are *intentional* – they test a candidate’s **attention to detail**.



### 3.3 The Ugly – Why Some Candidates Struggle

| Ugly Element | Why It’s Ugly |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Hidden rate recalculation** | Candidates sometimes recompute the rate for each sub‑problem from scratch, leading to an `O(n^3)` algorithm that still passes but feels messy. |
| **Wrong order of indices** | Swapping `last` and `i` in the memo array is a subtle bug that compiles but returns wrong answers. |
| **Improper base case** | Returning `0` when `k_left != 0` can make the algorithm *unintuitive* – interviewers will immediately spot it. |
| **Over‑engineering** | Adding segment trees or fancy pruning when a plain 3‑D array is enough demonstrates lack of algorithmic humility. |

> **Lesson**: Keep it simple; double‑check that you *never* lose track of how many merges you’ve used.



### 3.4 How to Turn This Into an Interview Victory

1. **Ask clarifying questions**  
   *“Do the `k` merges need to be used exactly?”*  
   *“What happens if `k` is larger than the number of available signs?”*

2. **Explain the state space** – Draw a 3‑D cube: `k_left` (rows), `current index` (columns), `last kept sign` (depth).  
   Candidates should *verbally* walk through the DP recurrence before coding.

3. **Use the prefix‑sum trick** – Show that you can compute `rate` in `O(1)` after a one‑pass prefix sum.  
   This saves `O(n^2)` time inside the DP loop.

4. **Write clean code** – Use meaningful variable names (`solve`, `dp`, `rate`, `dist`), avoid magic numbers, and comment the base case.

5. **Test edge cases** –  
   * All merges used early vs. all merges left to the end.  
   * Smallest `n` (`n==2`) vs. largest (`n==50`).  
   * `k==0` (no merges) → the answer is simply the sum of all `dist*time[i]`.



### 3.5 Final Checklist for Interview Success

1. **Understand the problem** – read it a few times, note the “exactly k” constraint.  
2. **Spot the DP** – see that each merge changes the future rate.  
3. **Build the prefix sum** – store cumulative `time[]`.  
4. **Define the DP state** – `(k_left, i, last)` is the cleanest.  
5. **Implement** – Use a 3‑D array or `@lru_cache` / `unordered_map`.  
6. **Test** – Run the sample test cases and a few random cases.  
7. **Explain** – While coding, narrate your thought process.  
8. **Refactor** – If time allows, convert to an iterative DP for a slick final answer.

### 3.6 Wrap‑Up

*Merge Operations for Minimum Travel Time* is an excellent showcase of **dynamic programming** for interviewees.  By leveraging prefix sums and a clear 3‑D state, you can solve it in milliseconds and explain the logic with confidence.  

> Whether you’re preparing for a Google, Amazon, or smaller‑company interview, mastering this problem demonstrates that you’re comfortable with interval DP, careful with constraints, and ready to turn a tricky “exact‑k” problem into a clean, maintainable solution.

## 4. Ready to Go

- Use the reference code as a *starter template* for interviews.
- Study the “good, bad, ugly” analysis to anticipate interview questions on DP.
- Feel free to tweak the implementations (e.g. convert to bottom‑up DP) – the core logic stays the same.
