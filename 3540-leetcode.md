## 1. Problem Overview

You are standing at house **0** on a circular street of **n** houses.  
For every adjacent pair of houses there are *two* directed roads:

| Direction | Road Length |
|-----------|-------------|
| Clockwise (i ‚Üí i+1) | `forward[i]` |
| Counter‚ÄëClockwise (i ‚Üí i‚àí1) | `backward[i]` |

The street wraps around, so house `n‚Äë1` connects back to house `0`.

Given an array `queries` that lists the houses you must visit in order  
(guaranteed that consecutive entries differ, `queries[0] != 0`), find the *minimum* total time (meters) to travel from house to house.  
You walk at **1‚ÄØm/s**, so the time equals the distance.

> **Constraints**  
> - `2‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØn‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ10‚Åµ`  
> - `1‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØforward[i], backward[i]‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ10‚Åµ`  
> - `1‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØqueries.length‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ10‚Åµ`

The task is a classic *circular graph shortest path* problem with multiple queries.

---

## 2. Intuition & Core Insight

Because the graph is a **simple cycle**, the shortest path between any two houses is **one of only two options**:

1. Go clockwise (forward direction).  
2. Go counter‚Äëclockwise (backward direction).

Hence, the distance from house `u` to house `v` is:

```
min( clockwise_distance(u, v), counter_clockwise_distance(u, v) )
```

The challenge is to compute these two distances **O(1)** for each query.

### The Trick ‚Äì Prefix Sums

If we pre‚Äëcompute the cumulative distances around the circle, we can obtain any partial sum in constant time.

- `fwd[i]` = total forward distance from house `0` to house `i` (clockwise).  
- `bwd[i]` = total backward distance from house `0` to house `i` (counter‚Äëclockwise).

With these arrays we can evaluate the two distances using simple arithmetic, handling the wrap‚Äëaround case by subtracting from the total perimeter.

---

## 3. Prefix‚ÄëSum Solution

1. **Build Prefix Arrays**  
   ```text
   fwd[0] = 0
   fwd[i+1] = fwd[i] + forward[i]          (0 ‚â§ i < n)

   bwd[0] = 0
   bwd[i+1] = bwd[i] + backward[i]         (0 ‚â§ i < n-1)
   bwd[n]   = bwd[n-1] + backward[0]      // closes the circle
   ```
   `fwd[n]` and `bwd[n]` both equal the perimeter of the cycle.

2. **Answer Each Query**  
   Let `cur` be the current house (start at `0`).  
   For target house `next`:

   *Clockwise distance*  
   ```text
   if cur ‚â§ next:
        cw = fwd[next] - fwd[cur]
   else:
        cw = fwd[n] - (fwd[cur] - fwd[next])   // wrap‚Äëaround
   ```

   *Counter‚Äëclockwise distance*  
   ```text
   if cur ‚â• next:
        ccw = bwd[cur] - bwd[next]
   else:
        ccw = bwd[n] - (bwd[next] - bwd[cur])  // wrap‚Äëaround
   ```

   Add `min(cw, ccw)` to the answer, then set `cur = next`.

3. **Return the total time**.

All arithmetic uses 64‚Äëbit integers (`long`/`long long`) to avoid overflow (`n * maxEdge ‚â§ 10‚Åµ * 10‚Åµ = 10¬π‚Å∞`).

---

## 4. Time & Space Complexity

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Build prefix arrays | **O(n)** | **O(n)** |
| Process queries | **O(q)** | **O(1)** (apart from input arrays) |
| **Total** | **O(n + q)** | **O(n)** |

With `n, q ‚â§ 10‚Åµ` this easily fits the limits.

---

## 5. Implementation

Below are clean, idiomatic solutions for **Python 3.11+**, **Java¬†17**, and **C++17**.  
All use 64‚Äëbit integers and read the input directly (you can adapt to the LeetCode signature if needed).

### 5.1 Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minTotalTime(self, forward: List[int], backward: List[int], queries: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(forward)

        # Prefix sums (clockwise)
        fwd = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            fwd[i + 1] = fwd[i] + forward[i]

        # Prefix sums (counter‚Äëclockwise)
        bwd = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            bwd[i + 1] = bwd[i] + backward[i]
        bwd[n] = bwd[n - 1] + backward[0]   # close the circle

        total = 0
        cur = 0

        for nxt in queries:
            # clockwise
            if cur <= nxt:
                cw = fwd[nxt] - fwd[cur]
            else:
                cw = fwd[n] - (fwd[cur] - fwd[nxt])

            # counter‚Äëclockwise
            if cur >= nxt:
                ccw = bwd[cur] - bwd[nxt]
            else:
                ccw = bwd[n] - (bwd[nxt] - bwd[cur])

            total += cw if cw < ccw else ccw
            cur = nxt

        return total
```

### 5.2 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public long minTotalTime(int[] forward, int[] backward, int[] queries) {
        int n = forward.length;

        long[] fwd = new long[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            fwd[i + 1] = fwd[i] + forward[i];
        }

        long[] bwd = new long[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            bwd[i + 1] = bwd[i] + backward[i];
        }
        bwd[n] = bwd[n - 1] + backward[0];   // close the circle

        long total = 0;
        int cur = 0;

        for (int nxt : queries) {
            long cw, ccw;

            // clockwise
            if (cur <= nxt) {
                cw = fwd[nxt] - fwd[cur];
            } else {
                cw = fwd[n] - (fwd[cur] - fwd[nxt]);
            }

            // counter‚Äëclockwise
            if (cur >= nxt) {
                ccw = bwd[cur] - bwd[nxt];
            } else {
                ccw = bwd[n] - (bwd[nxt] - bwd[cur]);
            }

            total += Math.min(cw, ccw);
            cur = nxt;
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

### 5.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long minTotalTime(vector<int>& forward,
                           vector<int>& backward,
                           vector<int>& queries) {
        int n = forward.size();

        vector<long long> fwd(n + 1, 0), bwd(n + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            fwd[i + 1] = fwd[i] + forward[i];

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i)
            bwd[i + 1] = bwd[i] + backward[i];
        bwd[n] = bwd[n - 1] + backward[0];   // close circle

        long long total = 0;
        int cur = 0;

        for (int nxt : queries) {
            long long cw, ccw;

            if (cur <= nxt) cw = fwd[nxt] - fwd[cur];
            else            cw = fwd[n] - (fwd[cur] - fwd[nxt]);

            if (cur >= nxt) ccw = bwd[cur] - bwd[nxt];
            else            ccw = bwd[n] - (bwd[nxt] - bwd[cur]);

            total += min(cw, ccw);
            cur = nxt;
        }
        return total;
    }
};
```

## 6. Common Pitfalls (The Bad & Ugly)

| Issue | Why It Happens | Fix |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| **Off‚Äëby‚Äëone in prefix sums** | Mixing 0‚Äëbased vs 1‚Äëbased indices while building `fwd` / `bwd`. | Keep the arrays of length `n+1` and always use `fwd[i+1] = fwd[i] + forward[i]`. |
| **Overflow in 32‚Äëbit int** | Max perimeter ‚âà 10¬π‚Å∞ > 2¬≥¬π‚Äë1. | Use `long` / `long long`. |
| **Ignoring the wrap‚Äëaround** | Assuming `cur <= nxt` always covers clockwise distance. | If `cur > nxt`, compute distance as `total_perimeter - (fwd[cur] - fwd[nxt])`. |
| **Misreading the `backward` array** | `backward[i]` is the road *into* house `i` (i.e., from `i` to `i‚Äë1`). | Build `bwd` such that `bwd[i+1]` uses `backward[i]`, and set `bwd[n]` by adding `backward[0]`. |
| **Using the wrong LeetCode signature** | LeetCode passes arrays by value; returning `int` may truncate. | Return `long`/`long long` and let the platform convert. |

## 7. How to Use This in Interviews

- **Explain the cycle property** ‚Äì emphasize that the graph has only two directions for a shortest path.  
- **Show the prefix‚Äësum idea** ‚Äì write down the formulas for clockwise and counter‚Äëclockwise distances.  
- **Walk through a sample** ‚Äì manually compute distances for a small `queries` to convince the interviewer you understand the logic.  
- **Mention integer safety** ‚Äì note the need for 64‚Äëbit variables.  

With these points you‚Äôll impress interviewers by turning a seemingly complex graph problem into an *O(1) arithmetic* solution.

---

## 8. Take‚Äëaway

- A **simple cycle** forces the shortest path to be either clockwise or counter‚Äëclockwise.  
- **Prefix sums** give instant access to any partial perimeter.  
- Pre‚Äëprocessing once and answering all queries in **O(1)** leads to an optimal **O(n + q)** algorithm.

This technique is widely applicable to problems involving distances on a circle (e.g., parking lot routes, circular conveyor belts, ring‚Äëtopology networks). Mastering it gives you a solid tool in any algorithmic toolkit.
