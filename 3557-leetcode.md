        ## 1.  The Code (Java | Python | C++)

Below are three completely self‑contained solutions that all run in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** extra space.  
They all use the *greedy* idea that we can always “commit” to a substring as soon as we see a valid one, because any later substring that starts inside the current one would necessarily overlap it.

```java
// ---------- Java ----------
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int maxSubstrings(String word) {
        int res = 0;
        Map<Character, Integer> first = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            char c = word.charAt(i);
            if (!first.containsKey(c)) {            // first time we see c
                first.put(c, i);
            } else if (i - first.get(c) + 1 >= 4) {  // valid non‑overlapping substring
                res++;
                first.clear();                     // start over – no overlap allowed
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

```python
# ---------- Python ----------
def maxSubstrings(word: str) -> int:
    res = 0
    first = {}
    for i, c in enumerate(word):
        if c not in first:
            first[c] = i
        elif i - first[c] + 1 >= 4:      # valid substring found
            res += 1
            first.clear()                # reset – no overlap
    return res
```

```cpp
// ---------- C++ ----------
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int maxSubstrings(string word) {
    int res = 0;
    unordered_map<char,int> first;
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)word.size(); ++i) {
        char c = word[i];
        if (!first.count(c)) {
            first[c] = i;                 // first occurrence
        } else if (i - first[c] + 1 >= 4) { // a valid substring ends here
            ++res;
            first.clear();                 // reset – no overlap allowed
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```

All three snippets compile with the standard‑library only and produce the same answer for every test case.

### Problem Overview <a name="problem-overview"></a>

You are given a string `word` (1 ≤ |word| ≤ 2 × 10⁵) consisting of lowercase English letters.  
Return the **maximum** number of *non‑overlapping* substrings that satisfy:

* Length ≥ 4  
* Starts and ends with the same letter  

Example  
```
word = "abcdeafdef"
→ ["abcdea", "fdef"]   (answer = 2)
```

---

### Why This Problem Matters <a name="why-this-problem-matters"></a>

- **Pattern‑matching** + **interval scheduling** → core CS skills.  
- Constraints push you toward **O(n)** solutions.  
- Many interviewers love problems where a *greedy* choice is actually optimal – it tests your ability to reason about optimality, not just coding.

---

### Brute‑Force / Intuition <a name="brute-force--intuition"></a>

A naive approach enumerates all substrings, checks validity, and then does an interval‑packing DP.  
Complexity: **O(n²)** time, **O(n²)** memory – impossible for 200 000 length strings.

Key insight: *Any valid substring is defined by a pair of equal characters at distance ≥ 3*.  
Thus we only need to track **first occurrences** of each letter.

---

### Dynamic Programming (The “Bad” Path) <a name="dynamic-programming-the-bad-path"></a>

A clean DP formulation:

```
dp[i] = max number of valid substrings in word[0 … i-1]
```

Transition:

```
dp[i+1] = max(dp[i+1], dp[j] + 1)   for all j where word[j]==word[i] and i-j+1 >= 4
```

Implementation uses a queue per letter to keep only the *last four* occurrences, reducing the inner loop to at most 4 checks per character.  
**Time:** O(n)  
**Space:** O(n) for dp array, O(n) for queues in worst case → **O(n)**

While correct, the DP’s extra array and bookkeeping make it heavier than necessary.  
Interviewers often prefer the cleaner greedy solution.

---

### Greedy (The “Good” Path) <a name="greedy-the-good-path"></a>

#### Observation

If we see a character `c` again and the distance between the two occurrences is ≥ 4, we *can* claim the substring between them **without loss of optimality**.  
Why?  
Because any substring that starts inside this candidate would have to end before the next character `c` (otherwise it would overlap), forcing it to be shorter than 4 – impossible.

#### Algorithm

1. Scan from left to right.  
2. For each letter store the **first index** where it appeared (`first[c]`).  
3. When the same letter appears again at index `i`:
   * If `i - first[c] + 1 ≥ 4` → **commit** to the substring `[first[c], i]`, increment answer, **clear all stored first indices** (no overlap allowed).  
   * Else → simply keep the earliest index (no commit yet).

The clear‑reset step guarantees the *no‑overlap* rule: every new substring starts after the previous one ends.

#### Why It Works

It is essentially the classic *interval scheduling by earliest finish time* proof:  
the earliest finish time (the earliest possible `i` that gives a valid substring) never hurts you because it leaves the maximum possible room for later substrings.

#### Code Snippets

The greedy is exactly the code we listed in section 1 (Java/Python/C++).  
Notice the **O(1)** space usage: only a tiny hash‑map of 26 keys that we empty every time we “commit”.

### Edge Cases & Pitfalls <a name="edge-cases--pitfalls"></a>

| Edge | What to watch out for | Fix |
|------|-----------------------|-----|
| `"aaaaa"` | The same letter appears 5 times → two substrings? | Greedy will commit on the *first* repeat that is ≥ 4, clearing everything – still optimal. |
| `"abcd"` | No equal letters at distance ≥ 3 → answer 0 | Your code must return 0 if no valid substring is found. |
| Repeated resets | Resetting the hash‑map on each commit is O(26) → trivial overhead. | If you use bit‑mask + arrays, resetting 26 entries is fine; if you use a vector per letter, you must clear all queues each time. |
| Large inputs | Use fast I/O if your language needs it (Java: `BufferedReader`, Python: `sys.stdin.read()`). | In the snippet we use `enumerate(word)` – already linear in CPython. |

---

### Testing Your Solution <a name="testing-your-solution"></a>

1. **Sample tests** (from the prompt).  
2. **Random tests**: generate strings of random length up to 10 000, brute‑force with a slow solver for correctness.  
3. **Stress tests**: a long string of 200 000 characters, e.g. `word = 'a'*200000` → answer = 50000.  
4. **Edge cases**: `"abcd"`, `"abc"`, `"a"*4`.

Example Python stress test:

```python
import random, string, time
def brute(word):
    n=len(word); best=0
    # O(n^2) brute – only for tiny strings
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+3, n):
            if word[i]==word[j]:
                best=max(best,1)
    return best

for _ in range(1000):
    s=''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase) for _ in range(random.randint(1,20)))
    assert maxSubstrings(s)==brute(s)
print("All random tests passed")
```

### Take‑aways & Interview Tips <a name="take-aways--interview-tips"></a>

| What to Emphasise | Why |
|-------------------|-----|
| **Explain the greedy argument** | Shows you understood the problem, not just wrote code. |
| **Mention constraints → O(n) required** | Interviewers love it when you talk about complexity early. |
| **Show both DP & Greedy** | Demonstrates breadth of knowledge. |
| **Highlight the reset step** | It is the only “ugly” part that needs careful handling. |
| **Test edge cases live** | It makes your solution robust and shows analytical thinking. |

**TL;DR** – Use the hash‑map version, clear on success, and be ready to explain *why* this commit is safe.

### Further Reading & Resources <a name="further-reading--resources"></a>

- **Interval Scheduling** – classic greedy textbook problem.  
- **LeetCode Solutions (C++, Java, Python)** – practice similar problems like *Longest Repeating Substring* or *Maximum Number of Non‑Overlapping Segments*.

### Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

LeetCode 3557 is a *pattern matching + interval scheduling* puzzle that sits at the intersection of DP and Greedy.  
The greedy solution is both **simpler** and **more efficient** for interview settings, while the DP version showcases a classic “full‑blown” approach.

By mastering this problem you’ll not only solve the question itself but also learn how to:

* **Choose the right algorithm** under tight constraints.  
* **Justify optimality** with a clean proof.  
* **Write clean, cross‑language code** that can be shown to a panel of interviewers.

Good luck on your next coding interview – and remember: sometimes the simplest choice is the most powerful!
