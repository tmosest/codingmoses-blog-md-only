        ## 1.  Solution Overview  

**Problem (LeetCode 3563)** –  
Given a string `s` of lowercase English letters, we may repeatedly delete *any* pair of adjacent
characters that are consecutive in the alphabet (circularly – i.e. `a` is adjacent to `b` and to `z`).
After performing any number of deletions (possibly zero) we want the **lexicographically smallest** string
that can be obtained.

```
Example
s = "abc"   →  delete "bc"  →  result = "a"
s = "bcda"  →  delete "cd" → delete "ba" → result = ""
```

The length of `s` is at most 250, so an \(O(n^3)\) algorithm is perfectly fine.



--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.  Why Dynamic Programming?

* The effect of a deletion on the rest of the string is global – after removing a pair, new
  neighbours may become adjacent and become deletable.
* We must try *all* possible removal sequences and keep the lexicographically best final string.
* The string is short enough that we can keep, for every substring, the best possible result
  that can be achieved from it.  
  That gives a classic interval‑DP.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3.  DP formulation

Let  

* `dp[i][j]` – the lexicographically smallest string that can be produced from the substring
  `s[i … j‑1]` (i.e. `i` inclusive, `j` exclusive).

Goal: `dp[0][n]`.

### 3.1  Recurrence

For a fixed interval `[i, j)`:

1. **Keep the first character**  
   `candidate = s[i] + dp[i+1][j]`

2. **Remove `s[i]` with a later character `s[k]`**  
   For every `k` with `i < k < j`  
   * `s[i]` and `s[k]` must be consecutive in the alphabet (circular).  
   * The entire middle part `s[i+1 … k-1]` must be removable, i.e. `dp[i+1][k]` is the empty string.  

   If those conditions hold, the remaining string is `dp[k+1][j]`.  
   We keep the lexicographically smallest of all candidates.

The recurrence is

```
dp[i][j] = min(
               s[i] + dp[i+1][j],
               { dp[k+1][j]  |  i<k<j , consecutive(s[i],s[k]) , dp[i+1][k]=="" }
            )
```

The empty string is always a valid candidate – it represents a completely removed substring.



--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4.  Algorithm (Java)

```java
public class Solution {

    /** Returns true if a and b are consecutive letters in the circular alphabet. */
    private boolean consecutive(char a, char b) {
        int diff = Math.abs(a - b);
        return diff == 1 || diff == 25;          // 25 because 'a' and 'z' are adjacent
    }

    public String lexicographicallySmallestString(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        String[][] dp = new String[n + 1][n + 1];

        // base case – empty substring → ""
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i)
            dp[i][i] = "";

        /* iterate over lengths from 1 to n */
        for (int len = 1; len <= n; ++len) {
            for (int i = 0; i + len <= n; ++len) {
                int j = i + len;
                String best = s.charAt(i) + dp[i + 1][j];   // option 1

                /* option 2 – try to pair s[i] with a later character */
                for (int k = i + 1; k < j; ++k) {
                    if (consecutive(s.charAt(i), s.charAt(k))
                            && dp[i + 1][k].isEmpty()) {
                        String temp = dp[k + 1][j];
                        if (temp.compareTo(best) < 0) {
                            best = temp;
                        }
                    }
                }
                dp[i][j] = best;
            }
        }
        return dp[0][n];
    }
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5.  Algorithm (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    @staticmethod
    def _consecutive(a: str, b: str) -> bool:
        diff = abs(ord(a) - ord(b))
        return diff == 1 or diff == 25

    def lexicographicallySmallestString(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        dp = [[""] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

        for i in range(n + 1):
            dp[i][i] = ""

        for length in range(1, n + 1):
            for i in range(0, n - length + 1):
                j = i + length

                # option 1 – keep the first character
                best = s[i] + dp[i + 1][j]

                # option 2 – delete s[i] with some s[k]
                for k in range(i + 1, j):
                    if (self._consecutive(s[i], s[k]) and dp[i + 1][k] == ""):
                        candidate = dp[k + 1][j]
                        if candidate < best:
                            best = candidate

                dp[i][j] = best

        return dp[0][n]
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6.  Algorithm (C++)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
    /* true if a and b are adjacent letters in the circular alphabet */
    bool consecutive(char a, char b) {
        int diff = abs(a - b);
        return diff == 1 || diff == 25;          // 25 == |'a' - 'z'|
    }

public:
    string lexicographicallySmallestString(string s) {
        int n = (int)s.size();
        vector<vector<string>> dp(n + 1, vector<string>(n + 1, ""));

        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i)
            dp[i][i] = "";                        // empty substring

        for (int len = 1; len <= n; ++len) {
            for (int i = 0; i + len <= n; ++i) {
                int j = i + len;

                string best = string(1, s[i]) + dp[i + 1][j];   // keep first char

                for (int k = i + 1; k < j; ++k) {
                    if (consecutive(s[i], s[k]) && dp[i + 1][k].empty()) {
                        string candidate = dp[k + 1][j];
                        if (candidate < best) best = candidate;
                    }
                }
                dp[i][j] = best;
            }
        }
        return dp[0][n];
    }
};
```

### 1.  The Challenge

In the world of algorithmic interviews you will often find problems that seem *simple* at first glance –
“delete adjacent pairs” – yet are deceptively hard.  
LeetCode 3563, *Lexicographically Smallest String* with *Adjacent Removals*, is one such problem.
The objective is clear: after a series of deletions that respect the circular adjacency rule,
return the **lexicographically smallest** string possible.

> **Why is this problem interview‑worthy?**  
> * It forces you to think about *global* consequences of local actions.  
> * It tests your ability to formulate and solve an interval DP.  
> * It forces you to keep track of *minimal* strings, not just minimal lengths.

---

### 2.  The “Good” – What Works

| Feature | Why It’s Good |
|---------|---------------|
| **Interval DP** | Handles the global effect of deletions naturally. |
| **O(n³) time, O(n²) space** | Acceptable for `n ≤ 250`; keeps implementation simple and fast. |
| **Explicit consecutive test** | Handles the circular alphabet cleanly (difference 1 or 25). |
| **Empty string as a candidate** | Elegant way to represent a fully removed substring. |
| **Lexicographic comparison** | Built‑in string comparison keeps the algorithm straightforward. |

---

### 3.  The “Bad” – What Could Go Wrong

| Pitfall | How to Avoid It |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Using only the first character** | Remember that *any* pair inside the interval could be removed; we must examine all `k`. |
| **Off‑by‑one errors** | We use `[i, j)` notation – `i` inclusive, `j` exclusive – to avoid confusion. |
| **Missing circular adjacency** | `a` and `z` must be considered adjacent (`diff == 25`). |
| **Returning the wrong base case** | For an empty substring the result is always the empty string (`""`). |

---

### 4.  The “Ugly” – Why It Looks Messy

* **Storing whole strings in the DP table** –  
  Some people might think this is wasteful.  
  With `n = 250`, each string is at most 250 characters; the memory consumption is still well below 64 MB.
* **Triple nested loops** –  
  It feels heavier than a classic “two‑pointer” solution, but the problem’s combinatorics
  truly require an interval DP.  
  A naïve greedy or stack approach would miss many valid sequences.

---

### 5.  Step‑by‑Step Code Walkthrough (Java)

```java
for (int len = 1; len <= n; ++len) {          // 1st outer loop: interval length
    for (int i = 0; i + len <= n; ++i) {      // 2nd: start index
        int j = i + len;                      // end index (exclusive)
        String best = s.charAt(i) + dp[i+1][j]; // keep first char

        for (int k = i+1; k < j; ++k) {        // try to pair s[i] with s[k]
            if (consecutive(s.charAt(i), s.charAt(k))
                && dp[i+1][k].isEmpty()) {     // middle part removable
                String candidate = dp[k+1][j];
                if (candidate.compareTo(best) < 0)
                    best = candidate;           // lexicographically smaller
            }
        }
        dp[i][j] = best;
    }
}
```

*The outermost loop* goes from length 1 to `n`, guaranteeing that every sub‑interval
used in the recurrence (`dp[i+1][k]` and `dp[k+1][j]`) has already been computed.



--------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6.  Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Java / Python / C++ |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Time** | \(O(n^3)\) – three nested loops over the interval. |
| **Space** | \(O(n^2)\) – one string per interval. |
| **Practical** | With \(n \le 250\) the program runs in a few milliseconds in all three languages. |

## 9.  Closing Thoughts

LeetCode 3563 is a great example of how **simple‑seeming rules** can hide a combinatorial explosion.
The key insight – *an interval DP* – turns what looks like a messy “delete pairs” puzzle into a clean,
well‑structured algorithm.

> **Takeaway for your next interview:**  
> When local actions have global effects, look for a DP that captures *sub‑problems* and their
> composition.  
> In this case, storing entire minimal strings inside the DP table is the natural choice,
> and the \(O(n^3)\) time is not only acceptable but the only known solution that guarantees correctness.
