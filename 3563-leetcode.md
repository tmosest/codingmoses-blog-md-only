        # 3563 – Lexicographically Smallest String After Adjacent Removals  
> **Hard | 250 chars | 250 letters**  

The problem:  
Given a string `s` (`1 ≤ |s| ≤ 250`) consisting of lowercase letters, we may repeatedly delete *any* adjacent pair of letters that are consecutive in the alphabet (including the circular pair `a‑z`). After all possible deletions, we want the *lexicographically smallest* resulting string.

> Example  
> `s = "abc"` → delete `"bc"` → `"a"` (best we can do)  
> `s = "bcda"` → delete `"cd"` → `"ba"` → delete `"ba"` → `""`  
> `s = "zdce"` → delete `"dc"` → `"ze"` but `"zdce"` is lexicographically smaller, so we keep the original.

The key is that *removing* a pair may expose a new pair that becomes removable, but deleting a pair can also make a later deletion impossible. Hence we must consider *all* possible removal sequences.

---

## 1.  The Idea – Dynamic Programming on Intervals

Let  

```
dp[l][r] = the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained
           from the substring s[l … r]   (inclusive).
```

The answer is `dp[0][n‑1]`.

### Base cases

* `l > r` – empty substring → empty string.
* `l == r` – single character – cannot be removed → the character itself.

### Transition

For a substring `s[l … r]` we have two options:

1. **Keep the first character**  
   `s[l]` + `dp[l+1][r]`.

2. **Remove `s[l]` together with some `s[k]` (`l < k ≤ r`)**  
   This is only possible when:

   * `s[l]` and `s[k]` are consecutive (circularly) → `isConsec(s[l], s[k])`.
   * The *entire* segment between them `s[l+1 … k-1]` can be cleared.  
     That is exactly when `dp[l+1][k-1] == ""`.

   If both conditions hold, after deleting that pair the rest of the
   substring is `dp[k+1][r]`.  
   We choose the smaller string among all such candidates.

Because `|s| ≤ 250`, a straightforward `O(n³)` DP (or memoised recursion) runs in well under a second.

## 2.  How to check “consecutive”

For two letters `c1` and `c2` let  

```
diff = (c1 - 'a' - (c2 - 'a') + 26) % 26
```

`diff` equals `1` or `25` ↔ the letters are consecutive
(`a‑b`, `b‑c`, … or the circular `z‑a`, `a‑z`).

## 2.  Reference Implementations  

Below are three **complete, production‑ready** solutions – Java, Python and C++ – that follow the DP strategy described above.  
All codes compile with the standard compilers:

* **Java** – `javac Solution.java && java Solution`
* **Python** – `python3 solution.py`
* **C++** – `g++ -std=c++17 -O2 solution.cpp && ./solution`

### 2.1  Java 17

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private String s;
    private int n;
    private String[][] memo;

    public String lexicographicallySmallestString(String s) {
        this.s = s;
        this.n = s.length();
        memo = new String[n][n];
        return dp(0, n - 1);
    }

    private String dp(int l, int r) {
        if (l > r) return "";
        if (l == r) return String.valueOf(s.charAt(l));

        // If we keep the first character
        String best = s.charAt(l) + dp(l + 1, r);

        // Try to delete s[l] together with some s[k]
        for (int k = l + 1; k <= r; k++) {
            if (isConsecutive(s.charAt(l), s.charAt(k)) &&
                dp(l + 1, k - 1).isEmpty()) {

                String candidate = dp(k + 1, r);
                if (candidate.compareTo(best) < 0) best = candidate;
            }
        }
        memo[l][r] = best;
        return best;
    }

    private boolean isConsecutive(char a, char b) {
        int diff = (a - 'a' - (b - 'a') + 26) % 26;
        return diff == 1 || diff == 25;
    }

    // ------------------------------------------------------------------
    //  Test harness – can be removed in production
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.lexicographicallySmallestString("abc"));   // a
        System.out.println(sol.lexicographicallySmallestString("bcda"));  // (empty)
        System.out.println(sol.lexicographicallySmallestString("zdce"));  // zdce
        System.out.println(sol.lexicographicallySmallestString("aab"));   // a
        System.out.println(sol.lexicographicallySmallestString("za"));    // (empty)
    }
}
```

### 2.2  Python 3

```python
import functools

class Solution:
    def lexicographicallySmallestString(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = len(s)

        @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
        def dp(l: int, r: int) -> str:
            if l > r:
                return ""
            if l == r:
                return s[l]

            # 1. Keep the first character
            best = s[l] + dp(l + 1, r)

            # 2. Try to remove s[l] with some s[k]
            for k in range(l + 1, r + 1):
                if self._consecutive(s[l], s[k]) and dp(l + 1, k - 1) == "":
                    cand = dp(k + 1, r)
                    if cand < best:
                        best = cand
            return best

        return dp(0, n - 1)

    @staticmethod
    def _consecutive(a: str, b: str) -> bool:
        diff = (ord(a) - ord(b)) % 26
        return diff == 1 or diff == 25

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Example usage
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    print(sol.lexicographicallySmallestString("abc"))    # a
    print(sol.lexicographicallySmallestString("bcda"))   # ''
    print(sol.lexicographicallySmallestString("zdce"))   # zdce
    print(sol.lexicographicallySmallestString("aab"))    # a
```

### 2.3  C++17

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string lexicographicallySmallestString(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<vector<string>> memo(n, vector<string>(n));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) memo[i][i] = string(1, s[i]);

        for (int len = 2; len <= n; ++len) {
            for (int l = 0; l + len - 1 < n; ++l) {
                int r = l + len - 1;
                string best = s[l] + memo[l + 1][r];

                for (int k = l + 1; k <= r; ++k) {
                    if (consec(s[l], s[k]) && memo[l + 1][k - 1].empty()) {
                        string cand = (k == r) ? "" : memo[k + 1][r];
                        if (cand < best) best = cand;
                    }
                }
                memo[l][r] = best;
            }
        }
        return memo[0][n - 1];
    }

private:
    bool consec(char a, char b) const {
        int diff = (a - 'a' - (b - 'a') + 26) % 26;
        return diff == 1 || diff == 25;
    }
};

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Demo in main – remove in production
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    cout << sol.lexicographicallySmallestString("abc") << '\n';   // a
    cout << sol.lexicographicallySmallestString("bcda") << '\n';  // (empty)
    cout << sol.lexicographicallySmallestString("zdce") << '\n';  // zdce
    return 0;
}
```

All three implementations run in `O(n³)` time and `O(n²)` memory.  
With `n ≤ 250` the worst‑case number of operations is below 16 million – easily fast enough for the 2 second limit.

## 2.  What Works Well – The “Good”  

| ✔ | Aspect |
|---|--------|
| ✅ | **Correctness** – the DP explores every deletion path, guaranteeing the true minimum. |
| ✅ | **Simplicity** – the code is a small recursive function plus a small helper, no exotic data‑structures. |
| ✅ | **Scalability** – `O(n³)` with `n = 250` is trivial for modern CPUs. |
| ✅ | **Extensibility** – the same DP template can be adapted to many “interval‑removal” problems. |

---

## 3.  Where It Can Backfire – The “Bad”

| ❌ | Issue |
|----|-------|
| ⚠️ | **Time** – a naïve back‑tracking would blow up (factorial) – the DP cuts that down. |
| ⚠️ | **Space** – a memoised string table can use a lot of memory; we keep `O(n²)` strings, but each string can be up to `n` characters long – still < 250 × 250 ≈ 60 kB. |
| ⚠️ | **Readability** – interval DP is a classic pattern that may not be obvious to newcomers. |

---

## 4.  What We Didn't Do – The “Ugly”

* A greedy stack‑removal algorithm (pop when top‑current are consecutive) does *not* always give the lexicographically smallest string.  
  It works for the *classical* “delete adjacent consecutive pairs until no pair remains” problem, but the requirement here is to *minimise* the final string, not to minimise the number of deletions.

* A brute‑force enumeration of all deletion orders is **exponential** – completely impractical even for `|s| = 20`.

Thus the interval DP is the cleanest, most reliable solution.

---

## 5.  Testing the Code

| Input | Expected Output | Reason |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| `abc` | `a` | delete `bc` |
| `bcda` | `""` | `cd` → `ba` → `ba` → `a` → `z` → nothing |
| `zdce` | `zdce` | no deletion gives a smaller string |
| `aab` | `a` | keep first `a`, delete `ab` |
| `za` | `""` | delete the pair `za` |
| `az` | `az` | pair is not consecutive; nothing can be deleted |

## 6.  Takeaway for Interviews

1. **Identify the “interval”** – if the operation depends on a contiguous segment, DP on lengths is a go‑to.  
2. **Encode “can be removed?”** as a boolean function (`isConsecutive`).  
3. **Memoise** – avoid recomputation; in Java or Python use a 2‑D array or `lru_cache`.  
4. **Compare strings lexicographically** – `<` works in all languages.
