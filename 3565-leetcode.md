        **LeetCode 3565 – Sequential Grid Path Cover**  
*Problem, backtracking solution in Java, Python & C++, and a SEO‑friendly interview blog post.*

---

## 1. Problem Recap

You’re given a rectangular grid `m × n` (1 ≤ m,n ≤ 5).  
- The grid contains **exactly one** of every integer from `1` to `k` (k ≤ m·n).  
- All other cells hold `0`.  
- You can start **anywhere** and move to an orthogonal neighbour (up, down, left, right).  
- You must **visit every cell exactly once** and **visit the numbered cells in the order 1 → 2 → … → k**.

Return a list of coordinates `[x, y]` that describes one such path.  
If no path exists, return an empty list.

---

## 2. Why Backtracking Works

The grid is tiny (max 25 cells).  
The task is a classic *Hamiltonian path* problem with an added ordering constraint on the numbered cells.  
A brute‑force search that tries all permutations of the cells would be 25! (impossible).  
But the grid structure gives us a lot of structure:

* You can only move to a neighbouring cell.  
* The path must be a simple path – you cannot revisit a cell.  
* The numbered cells must appear in order, which is a very strong pruning rule.

With these facts, a depth‑first search that backtracks on dead ends is both simple to implement and fast enough for the constraints.

---

## 3. Algorithm Overview

1. **Locate the numbered cells** – store `(row, col)` for every number `1…k`.  
2. **DFS / backtracking**  
   * Keep a `visited[m][n]` boolean matrix.  
   * Maintain the next required number (`nextNum`) and the current position.  
   * On each step:
     * Mark the cell as visited and push its coordinates to the path list.  
     * If the cell’s value is a number:
       * It must equal `nextNum`; otherwise abort this branch.  
       * Increment `nextNum`.  
     * If the path length equals `m·n`, we are done – return success.  
     * Recurse into all 4 neighbours that are inside the grid and not yet visited.  
     * If a recursive call returns success, bubble it up.  
     * Backtrack: unmark visited, pop path, decrement `nextNum` if we had moved onto a numbered cell.  
3. **Start positions** – because we can start anywhere, we try every cell as the initial point.  
4. **Return** the first complete path we find; otherwise return an empty list.

## 4. Complexity Analysis

Let `N = m · n` (≤ 25).  
In the worst case, the DFS explores all Hamiltonian paths: `O(N!)`.  
However, the ordering constraint on the numbered cells prunes the tree heavily.  
With the small grid size the algorithm runs in well under a second in practice.

Space complexity:  
`O(N)` for the recursion stack, visited matrix, and path list.

            }
        }

        if (!found) return new ArrayList<>();

        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] cell : path) {
            result.add(Arrays.asList(cell[0], cell[1]));
        }
        return result;
    }

                undo(x, y, nextNum);
                return;
            }
            nextNum++; // we just visited the expected number
        }

        if (path.size() == m * n) { // visited all cells
            found = true;
            return;
        }

        for (int[] d : DIRS) {
            int nx = x + d[0], ny = y + d[1];
            if (nx < 0 || nx >= m || ny < 0 || ny >= n) continue;
            if (visited[nx][ny]) continue;
            dfs(nx, ny, nextNum);
            if (found) return;
        }

        undo(x, y, nextNum);
    }

    private void undo(int x, int y, int nextNum) {
        visited[x][y] = false;
        path.remove(path.size() - 1);
        // no need to adjust nextNum because we passed it by value
    }
}
```

### 5.2 Python

        visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(m)]
        path: List[List[int]] = []
        found = False

        def dfs(x: int, y: int, next_num: int) -> bool:
            nonlocal found
            visited[x][y] = True
            path.append([x, y])

            if grid[x][y] != 0:
                if grid[x][y] != next_num:
                    # wrong order – backtrack
                    visited[x][y] = False
                    path.pop()
                    return False
                next_num += 1

            if len(path) == m * n:
                return True

            for dx, dy in self.DIRS:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny]:
                    if dfs(nx, ny, next_num):
                        return True

            # backtrack
            visited[x][y] = False
            path.pop()
            return False

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if dfs(i, j, 1):

## 6. Blog Post – “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Sequential Grid Path Cover”

### 6.1 Headline

> **Cracking LeetCode 3565: Sequential Grid Path Cover – Backtracking Mastery for Your Next Tech Interview**

### 6.2 Meta Description

> Discover the optimal backtracking solution for LeetCode 3565, with Java, Python, and C++ code, plus a detailed guide on why this algorithm works. Perfect for coding interview prep.

### 6.3 Intro

> **Are you struggling with LeetCode’s “Sequential Grid Path Cover”?**  
> With a tiny grid but a heavy ordering constraint, this problem seems to sit at the intersection of combinatorial explosion and clever pruning. In this article we’ll walk through the *good*, *bad*, and *ugly* parts of the challenge, present a clean backtracking solution in three popular languages, and give you the interview‑ready mindset you need to impress recruiters.

### 6.4 The Good

1. **Tiny Input Size** – Max 5×5 grid.  
   - This means a naïve exponential search is feasible; we can focus on clean logic instead of micro‑optimisations.
2. **Strong Pruning Rule** – The numbered cells must be visited in order.  
   - As soon as we step onto a number that isn’t the next expected one, the whole branch dies.
3. **Clear Problem Decomposition** – “Visit all cells once” + “follow order” = simple DFS with backtracking.

### 6.5 The Bad

1. **No Direct DP** – Because we must cover *every* cell exactly once, traditional dynamic programming over subsets (like Hamiltonian path) would still be `O(2^N)` which is heavy even for N=25.  
2. **Many Start Positions** – We need to try each cell as a potential start, increasing the constant factor.
3. **Order Dependency** – If the numbered cells are poorly distributed (e.g., all in one corner), the search can blow up before pruning kicks in.

### 6.6 The Ugly

1. **Dead‑End Traps** – A single misplaced step (e.g., stepping on a 0 that blocks the path to the next number) can kill the whole branch.  
2. **Symmetric Paths** – The same path can be discovered in many mirrored orders, wasting work.  
3. **Stack Overflow Risk** – In languages like Python, deep recursion can hit limits if not carefully handled (though with N=25 it’s usually fine).

### 6.7 Why Backtracking Is the Sweet Spot

* **Simplicity** – The algorithm maps directly to the problem statement.  
* **Pruning** – The “next number” check prunes over 90% of the search space immediately.  
* **Deterministic Output** – Once a valid path is found, we can return it immediately – perfect for interview “solve it, then explain”.

### 6.8 Implementation Highlights

| Language | Key Points |
|----------|------------|
| **Java** | Uses `List<int[]>` for path, recursion with early return, mutable `visited` matrix. |
| **Python** | Uses closures for DFS, `nonlocal` to capture `found`. |
| **C++** | Lambda recursion, `std::vector` for path, minimal overhead. |

### 6.9 Interview‑Ready Tips

1. **Explain the DFS logic clearly** – talk about the state (`visited`, `nextNum`, `path`) and why each rule is necessary.  
2. **Discuss pruning** – show that stepping onto a number out of order immediately kills the branch.  
3. **Mention constraints** – highlight that with 5×5 we can afford exponential search.  
4. **Show edge‑case handling** – e.g., when `k == m*n` or when the grid is full of zeros except a few numbers.

### 6.10 SEO Checklist

- **Primary keyword**: “LeetCode 3565 sequential grid path cover”  
- **Secondary keywords**: “backtracking solution”, “Java DFS”, “Python Hamiltonian path”, “coding interview prep”, “job interview algorithms”.  
- **Meta tags**: Title, description, and relevant alt‑text for images (if any).  
- **Header structure**: H1 for the title, H2 for sections (“The Good”, “The Bad”, etc.).  

### 6.11 Final Thoughts

LeetCode 3565 is a *small* problem that *tests* your understanding of backtracking and constraint propagation. Mastering it will not only earn you points on the platform but also demonstrate to recruiters that you can translate a seemingly daunting search problem into a clean, efficient algorithm.

Happy coding, and good luck on your next interview!
