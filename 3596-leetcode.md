        ## 1.  Code ‚Äì 3 Languages

Below you‚Äôll find a **single‚Äëline, O(1) solution** that works for every valid test case.  
It is based on the mathematical insight that the only grids that can be reached are

| m | n | Reason |
|---|---|--------|
| 1 | 1 | already at the destination |
| 2 | 1 | one odd move (down) |
| 1 | 2 | one odd move (right) |
| else | ‚Äì | impossible ‚Äì return `-1` |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important** ‚Äì do **not** try to run a BFS/DP for huge `m, n` (up to `10‚Å∂`).  
> The observation above turns a 2‚Äëminute interview problem into a 1‚Äëminute answer.

### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(int m, int n) {
        // only three reachable grids
        if (m == 1 && n == 1) return 1;            // cost (1*1)
        if (m == 2 && n == 1) return 3;            // 1 + (2*1)
        if (m == 1 && n == 2) return 3;            // 1 + (1*2)
        return -1;                                 // impossible
    }
}
```

---

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        if m == 1 and n == 1:          # 1√ó1 grid
            return 1
        if m == 2 and n == 1:          # 2√ó1 grid
            return 3
        if m == 1 and n == 2:          # 1√ó2 grid
            return 3
        return -1                      # all other grids are unreachable
```

---

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(int m, int n) {
        if (m == 1 && n == 1) return 1;      // 1√ó1 grid
        if (m == 2 && n == 1) return 3;      // 2√ó1 grid
        if (m == 1 && n == 2) return 3;      // 1√ó2 grid
        return -1;                           // impossible
    }
};
```

> All three snippets run in **O(1) time** and **O(1) space**.

## 2.  Blog Article ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of LeetCode¬†3596‚Äù

### 2.1  Introduction  

**Minimum Cost Path with Alternating Directions I (LeetCode¬†3596)** is one of those interview puzzles that looks like a typical ‚Äúgrid‚ÄëDP‚Äù problem but hides a *simple mathematical trick* that reduces it to a constant‚Äëtime solution.  

Why does this matter for your next job?  
Because interviewers love to see candidates spot the **obvious** and turn a seemingly hard problem into a *brilliant* one‚Äëliner.  

Below we dissect the problem, reveal the insight, and discuss the *good, the bad, and the ugly* of solving it ‚Äì all in a SEO‚Äëfriendly format that will help you land a tech role.

### 2.2  Problem Statement (Re‚Äëworded)

You‚Äôre given a rectangular grid with `m` rows and `n` columns.  
Entering cell `(i, j)` costs `(i+1) * (j+1)` (1‚Äëbased indices).  

- **Start**: at `(0,0)` (move¬†1, odd).  
- **Moves**:  
  * Odd‚Äënumbered moves ‚Üí **right** or **down**.  
  * Even‚Äënumbered moves ‚Üí **left** or **up**.  

Return the *minimum* total cost to reach the bottom‚Äëright corner `(m‚Äë1, n‚Äë1)`.  
If the destination can‚Äôt be reached, return `-1`.  

Constraints: `1 ‚â§ m, n ‚â§ 10‚Å∂`.  

---

### 2.3  Intuition ‚Äì The ‚ÄúAlternating‚Äù Insight

1. **Direction Alternation**  
   Each odd move pushes you farther from the start; each even move pulls you back.  
   The *Manhattan distance* from the origin after any number of moves is:
   ```
   distance = (#odd moves) ‚Äì (#even moves)
   ```

2. **Net Displacement Needed**  
   To reach `(m-1, n-1)` you must move  
   `down` **m-1** times  
   `right` **n-1** times  
   ‚Üí **total displacement** `D = (m-1)+(n-1)`.

3. **Equality Constraint**  
   For any legal sequence:  
   ```
   #odd moves ‚Äì #even moves = D
   ```
   But because moves strictly alternate, the difference can only be `0` (even total steps) or `1` (odd total steps).  
   Therefore:
   ```
   D ‚àà {0, 1}
   ```

4. **Translate to Grid Sizes**  
   - `D = 0` ‚Üí `m = 1` and `n = 1`.  
   - `D = 1` ‚Üí either `m = 2, n = 1` **or** `m = 1, n = 2`.  
   Any larger grid has `D ‚â• 2` and is impossible.

5. **Cost Calculation**  
   The only viable paths are single‚Äëmove paths:
   - `1√ó1`: cost = `1*1 = 1`.  
   - `2√ó1`: `1*1 + 2*1 = 3`.  
   - `1√ó2`: `1*1 + 1*2 = 3`.

That‚Äôs it! The solution boils down to a handful of `if` checks.

### 2.4  The O(1) Algorithm ‚Äì Code Walk‚Äëthrough

```text
if m == 1 && n == 1:   // 1√ó1 grid
    return 1
if m == 2 && n == 1:   // 2√ó1 grid
    return 3
if m == 1 && n == 2:   // 1√ó2 grid
    return 3
return -1              // all other grids unreachable
```

**Time complexity:** `O(1)` ‚Äì constant time, independent of `m` and `n`.  
**Space complexity:** `O(1)` ‚Äì only a few variables.

### 2.5  Good, Bad, Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Simplicity** | *Good* ‚Äì you only need a few lines. | ‚Äî | ‚Äî |
| **Performance** | *Good* ‚Äì works for `m, n = 10‚Å∂` instantly. | ‚Äî | ‚Äî |
| **Edge‚Äëcase coverage** | *Good* ‚Äì handles all reachable cases. | **Bad** ‚Äì might be overlooked by naive DP solutions. | **Ugly** ‚Äì any attempt to run BFS/DP on large grids will time‚Äëout or crash. |
| **Interview impact** | *Good* ‚Äì demonstrates pattern‚Äërecognition. | ‚Äî | ‚Äî |
| **Readability** | *Good* ‚Äì self‚Äëexplanatory. | ‚Äî | ‚Äî |

### 2.6  Tips for Interviewers

1. **Ask clarifying questions**: ‚ÄúDo you need the minimal cost path or just to know if it‚Äôs possible?‚Äù  
   The answer is ‚Äúboth‚Äù, but noticing that the cost is deterministic once the path length is known is key.

2. **Show the math first**: Write out the displacement equation on a whiteboard.  
   It instantly impresses interviewers and saves time.

3. **Talk through constraints**: `10‚Å∂` immediately hints that a naive DP (`O(mn)`) is infeasible.

4. **Mention the O(1) trick**: ‚ÄúBecause the alternating rule forces the number of odd and even moves to differ by at most one, the grid size must satisfy `m+n ‚â§ 3`.‚Äù

5. **Explain the cost**: ‚ÄúIn a single‚Äëmove path the cost is just the product of the coordinates.‚Äù

### 2.7  Why This Problem is a ‚ÄúJob‚ÄëHunter‚Äôs Goldmine‚Äù

- **Pattern recognition** ‚Äì interviewers love candidates who can spot hidden constraints.  
- **Constant‚Äëtime proof** ‚Äì demonstrates ability to prove correctness in O(1).  
- **Clear communication** ‚Äì concise code + well‚Äëwritten explanation shows professionalism.  

When you hit a LeetCode challenge that looks hard but is actually simple, the interviewers often remark on your *‚Äúbrain‚Äëteaser‚Äù* mindset. That is exactly the quality hiring managers look for in senior engineers.

---

### 2.8  Take‚Äëaway Checklist

- ‚úÖ Only `m+n ‚â§ 3` grids are reachable.  
- ‚úÖ Return the pre‚Äëcomputed costs for the three valid grids.  
- ‚úÖ Return `-1` for everything else.  
- ‚úÖ Complexity: `O(1)` time, `O(1)` space.  
- ‚úÖ Use the solution to demonstrate pattern recognition in interviews.

## 3.  Final Thoughts

LeetCode¬†3596 is a *‚Äúlook‚Äëhard, do‚Äëeasy‚Äù* problem. The trick is to understand how the alternating direction rule limits your displacement. Once you see that, the answer is just a handful of `if` statements.  

Drop the heavy DP into your pocket, put this O(1) solution on your r√©sum√©, and impress your future employer with the art of spotting the obvious. Happy coding‚Äîand happy interviewing! üöÄ
