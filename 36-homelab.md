# LibreTranslate / Lingarr / LeetCode Solver

Just saw a post from a TED talk with Soia Kianni from Phia where she discussing the language distribution for the world and how most people do not speak English. I know that Google has things like a Babel fish and Mark has things like the meta glasses which will be able to translate and I can make my own version of a Babel Fish but for now I would just like to have my LeetCode articles published in another language.

I also have plex so it would be cool to do this to subtitels in movies as well... could also try to upgrade the voice clone of Alfred from Batman and make it auto spanish... That would def need some refinement as I am not sure if certains sounds in one language like english could really carry over to others like spanish... e.g. will Alfred be able to role his r's in spanish given only English voice sample? Maybe I would need to mix him with a spanish speaker?

Things to think about... for now just going to test a local instance of LibreTranslate...
