## 🔧 1️⃣  Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    // ---------- DSU ----------
    static class DSU {
        int[] parent;

        DSU(int n) {
            parent = new int[n + 1];
            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) parent[i] = i;
        }

        int[] ans = new int[res.size()];
        for (int i = 0; i < ans.length; i++) ans[i] = res.get(i);
        return ans;

## 📚 4️⃣  Blog Article  
> **Title:** Power‑Grid Maintenance – The DSU + Min‑Heap Solution (LeetCode 3607)  
> **Keywords:** leetcode power grid maintenance, union find, priority queue, software engineer interview, job interview preparation, DSU, offline stations, algorithm analysis

---

### 1. Introduction  

Interviewers love problems that require you to think about *connectedness* and *dynamic updates*.  
The **Power‑Grid Maintenance** problem (LeetCode 3607) is a perfect showcase of that: you’re asked to answer queries about a network of power stations, each of which can **go offline** at any time.  
The trick? Keep track of *connected components* efficiently, and retrieve the smallest **online** station inside any component quickly.  

This article will walk you through the **DSU + Min‑Heap** approach, why it’s optimal, and how you can explain it to a hiring manager.

---

### 2. Problem Statement (Simplified)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Input** | `c` stations (`1 … c`) + `connections` (undirected edges) + `queries` (type 1 or 2) |
| **Query type 1** | `[1, x]` – *maintenance check*. If `x` is online, return `x`. If `x` is offline, return the smallest online station in **x’s component**. If none, return `-1`. |
| **Query type 2** | `[2, x]` – station `x` goes offline. |
| **Output** | Array of answers for all type‑1 queries. |

---

### 3. Constraints & Why This Matters

- `c ≤ 10⁵` (stations)  
- `connections` length ≤ `c – 1` (so the graph is a forest)  
- `queries` length ≤ `2·10⁵`  
- Time limit is tight → **O((n + q) log n)** is a must.

Brute‑force DFS/BFS for each query would be *O(n·q)* → far too slow.

---

### 4. Intuition

1. **Connectedness** – Two stations belong to the same *power grid* iff they’re connected by edges.  
   We need a data structure that tells us *“who is in the same component as this station?”* quickly → **Disjoint Set Union (Union‑Find)**.

2. **Smallest online station** – When a station is offline, the *maintenance check* must pick the smallest *online* station in that component.  
   The classic way to retrieve the minimum in O(log n) is a **min‑heap (priority queue)**.

3. **Offline updates** – Marking a station offline is O(1), but we don’t want to remove it from all heaps immediately (that would be O(n)).  
   Instead we use **lazy deletion**: when we query a heap, we pop elements that are known to be offline until the top is online.

Combining DSU with a heap per component gives us both *connectivity* and *minimum online station* in near‑constant time.

---

### 5. Data Structures

| Purpose | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **DSU** – component id per station | `int[] parent` (Java), `vector<int>` (C++), list (Python) |
| **Min‑heap per component** | `PriorityQueue<int>` / `priority_queue<int, greater<int>>` / `heapq` |
| **Online flag** | `boolean[]` / `vector<bool>` / `list[bool]` |

Why a **map from component id → heap**?  
Because after union operations many stations end up sharing the same root; we only need one heap per distinct root.

---

### 6. Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize DSU** with each station as its own parent.  
2. **Mark all stations online** (`true`).  
3. **Union all edges** to build the initial connected components.  
4. **Create a heap per component**:  
   * For each station `i`, find its root and push `i` into that component’s heap.  
   * Heaps store *all* stations, regardless of online status (lazy deletion later).  
5. **Process each query**:  
   * **Type 2** – `online[x] = false`. No heap removal.  
   * **Type 1** –  
     * If `x` is online → answer is `x`.  
     * Else:  
       * Find `root = find(x)`.  
       * While the heap’s top is offline, pop it (`lazy delete`).  
       * If the heap is empty → answer `-1`, else answer the top value.  
6. **Collect answers** into an array and return.

---

### 7. Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| DSU `find/union` | α(n) ≈ O(1) amortised (inverse Ackermann) |
| Heap push | O(log n) |
| Heap pop (lazy) | Each station is popped at most once → O(log n) overall |
| Each query | O(log n) due to potential heap clean‑up |

**Total**: `O((c + q) log c)` time, `O(c)` memory.

---

### 8. Edge Cases & Pitfalls

| Edge case | Why it matters | Fix |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| **Component with no online stations** | Should return `-1` | After clean‑up check `if heap.empty()` |
| **Station already offline** | Query may appear multiple times | Lazy deletion handles it |
| **Disconnected stations** | `find()` must be called after every union | Build heaps only after all unions |
| **Large number of components** | Using `unordered_map`/`HashMap` prevents O(n²) overhead | Pre‑allocate heaps via `computeIfAbsent` / `defaultdict` |
| **Java overflow in recursion** | DSU `find` uses recursion – depth ≤ log n | Use path compression to keep stack small |

---

### 9. Sample Test

```text
c = 5
connections = [[1,2],[3,4]]
queries = [[1,5],[2,5],[1,5],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [5, -1, 3]
```

Both the Java, Python, and C++ codes above produce the correct output for this test.

---

### 10. How This Helps Your Interview

* **Showcases advanced DSU usage** – Many interviewers expect you to know how to maintain component information.
* **Demonstrates lazy deletion** – A neat trick that keeps heap operations efficient without complicating the data structure.
* **Handles large constraints** – Your code will run under the toughest limits, proving you can write production‑grade solutions.

### 1. Introduction

The **Power‑Grid Maintenance** problem (LeetCode 3607) is a perfect blend of graph theory and data‑structure mastery.  
In this article we’ll walk through the full solution, highlight common pitfalls, and show you how to present it at an interview.

> **Keywords:** `leetcode power grid maintenance solution`, `union find`, `priority queue`, `software engineer interview`, `disjoint set union`, `offline stations`.

---

### 2. Problem Statement (in Your Own Words)

You have `c` power stations, each initially online.  
Stations are linked by `connections` (undirected edges).  
Two queries exist:

1. **[1, x] – Maintenance check**  
   *If `x` is online → answer `x`.*  
   *If `x` is offline → answer the smallest online station in `x`’s connected component; if none, answer `-1`.*

2. **[2, x] – Station goes offline**  

Return an array of answers for all type‑1 queries.

---

### 3. Constraints That Shape the Solution

- `c ≤ 10⁵` (stations)  
- `connections.length ≤ c‑1` – the graph is a forest (no cycles)  
- `queries.length ≤ 2·10⁵`  

We need a solution that is **O((c+q) log c)** or better.

---

### 4. Intuition

1. **Connected components** – Two stations are in the same power grid iff they’re connected.  
   The go‑to structure is **Disjoint Set Union (Union‑Find)**, which gives component IDs in almost constant time.

2. **Smallest online station** – We need to find the minimum *online* station quickly.  
   A **min‑heap** is perfect for retrieving the smallest element in logarithmic time.

3. **Dynamic offline updates** – Marking offline is O(1). Removing from heaps immediately is expensive.  
   Instead we let heaps contain *all* stations and clean up only when queried – a technique known as **lazy deletion**.

---

### 5. Choosing the Right Data Structures

| Goal | DSU | Min‑heap | Online Flag |
|------|-----|----------|-------------|
| **Component ID** | `parent` array (with path compression) | – | – |
| **Minimum online station** | – | `PriorityQueue` (Java), `priority_queue` (C++), `heapq` (Python) | – |
| **Mark offline** | – | – | `boolean[]` / `vector<bool>` |

Map each **component root** → **min‑heap**.  
Heaps store all stations; we lazily pop offline ones.

---

### 5.5 Why Lazy Deletion Works

- **Mark offline** → `online[x] = false`.  
- **Query** → keep popping until the top is online.  
- Each station is popped at most once → amortised O(log c).

This keeps the algorithm fast without sacrificing simplicity.

---

### 6. Step‑by‑Step Algorithm

1. **Build DSU** – union all given edges.  
2. **Initialize online status** – all `true`.  
3. **Create a heap per component** – push every station into its component’s heap.  
4. **Process queries**  
   * Type 2: set `online[x] = false`.  
   * Type 1: if online → return `x`; else find component root, clean its heap, and return top or `-1`.  

Collect all answers.

---

### 7. Implementation Highlights (Java, Python, C++)

- **Union‑Find** with path compression & union by size/rank.  
- **PriorityQueue** or `heapq` for min‑heap.  
- **Lazy Deletion** inside the query loop.

(Include the code snippets from section 1‑3 above.)

---

### 8. Common Interview Questions & How to Answer

| Question | Suggested Answer |
|-----------|------------------|
| Why not use BFS for each type‑1 query? | Complexity becomes `O(n·q)` – unacceptable for `c=10⁵`. |
| How does lazy deletion keep heaps efficient? | Each station is popped only when we query its component. Even if a station goes offline many times, we pop it once. |
| Why a forest? | Guarantees each station has at most one parent in DSU; simplifies the union operation. |
| Can we use a balanced BST instead of heaps? | BST gives O(log n) but we need to store *only online* nodes – updates would be costly. Heaps + lazy deletion is simpler. |

---

### 9. Code‑Level Tips for Interviews

- **Comment liberally** – explain `find`, `lazyDelete`, etc.  
- **Show path compression** – mention `α(n)` is practically constant.  
- **Highlight memory usage** – `O(c)` vs. naive O(n²).  

---

### 10. Summary & Takeaway

- **DSU** gives you component IDs in near‑constant time.  
- **Min‑heap** gives you the smallest online station quickly.  
- **Lazy deletion** ensures offline updates are cheap.  

Mastering this pattern proves you can solve large‑scale graph problems efficiently – a must‑have for any software engineer looking to crack top‑tech interviews.
