## 1. The 3 Implementations

> All three use the same idea: **reverse‑process the edges** in descending order of removal time and keep a DSU (Disjoint‑Set Union) to count connected components.

### 1.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    // DSU (Union‑Find) with path compression
    private static class DSU {
        int[] parent, rank;
        DSU(int n) {
            parent = new int[n];
            rank   = new int[n];
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) parent[i] = i;
        }
        int find(int x) {
            if (parent[x] != x) parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            return parent[x];
        }
        boolean union(int a, int b) {
            int ra = find(a), rb = find(b);
            if (ra == rb) return false;
            if (rank[ra] < rank[rb]) parent[ra] = rb;
            else if (rank[ra] > rank[rb]) parent[rb] = ra;
            else { parent[rb] = ra; rank[ra]++; }
            return true;
        }
    }

    public int minTime(int n, int[][] edges, int k) {
        // sort edges by time descending
        Arrays.sort(edges, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(b[2], a[2]));

        DSU dsu = new DSU(n);
        int comps = n;          // initially all nodes are isolated

        for (int[] e : edges) {
            if (dsu.union(e[0], e[1])) {
                comps--;        // two components merged
                if (comps < k)  // we just dropped below k
                    return e[2];
            }
        }
        // if we never dropped below k, answer is 0
        return 0;
    }
}
```

### 1.2 Python

```python
from typing import List

class DSU:
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank   = [0] * n

    def find(self, x: int) -> int:
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, a: int, b: int) -> bool:
        ra, rb = self.find(a), self.find(b)
        if ra == rb:
            return False
        if self.rank[ra] < self.rank[rb]:
            self.parent[ra] = rb
        elif self.rank[ra] > self.rank[rb]:
            self.parent[rb] = ra
        else:
            self.parent[rb] = ra
            self.rank[ra] += 1
        return True

class Solution:
    def minTime(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        # sort by time descending
        edges.sort(key=lambda e: -e[2])

        dsu = DSU(n)
        comps = n  # all nodes separate

        for u, v, t in edges:
            if dsu.union(u, v):
                comps -= 1
                if comps < k:
                    return t
        return 0
```

### 1.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class DSU {
public:
    vector<int> p, r;
    DSU(int n = 0) { init(n); }
    void init(int n) {
        p.resize(n);
        r.assign(n, 0);
        iota(p.begin(), p.end(), 0);
    }
    int find(int x) { return p[x] == x ? x : p[x] = find(p[x]); }
    bool unite(int a, int b) {
        a = find(a), b = find(b);
        if (a == b) return false;
        if (r[a] < r[b]) swap(a, b);
        p[b] = a;
        if (r[a] == r[b]) ++r[a];
        return true;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    int minTime(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int k) {
        sort(edges.begin(), edges.end(),
             [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
                 return a[2] > b[2];
             });

        DSU dsu(n);
        int comps = n;

        for (const auto &e : edges) {
            if (dsu.unite(e[0], e[1])) {
                if (--comps < k) return e[2];
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
```

## 2. Blog Post – “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Minimum Time for K Connected Components”

> **Target Audience**: Front‑end/Back‑end engineers, data‑structures enthusiasts, and anyone preparing for a LeetCode‑style interview.  
> **Goal**: Walk through the problem, show how to crack it, highlight pitfalls, and give interview‑ready insights.

### 2.1 Introduction

**LeetCode 3608 – Minimum Time for K Connected Components** is a classic *graph + DSU* problem that tests your understanding of Union‑Find, sorting, and offline processing. It’s not a trivial “count components” problem; the twist is that you’re asked to find the *minimum time* at which the graph will have *at least* `k` components after removing edges below that time.

> **SEO Keywords**: “Minimum Time for K Connected Components”, “LeetCode 3608 solution”, “Union‑Find graph problem”, “DSU interview”, “graph components interview question”.

---

### 2.2 Problem Restatement

> Given `n` nodes (0‑based) and `edges[i] = [u, v, time]` – an undirected edge that disappears at time `time`.  
> For a time `t`, all edges with `time <= t` are removed.  
> Find the **minimum** `t` such that the remaining graph has **at least `k` connected components**.  
> If the graph already has `k` or more components before any removal, answer is `0`.

**Constraints**: `1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵`, `0 ≤ edges.length ≤ 10⁵`, `time ≤ 10⁹`.

---

### 2.3 Intuition – The Reverse Process

Think of *adding* edges instead of removing them.  

1. **Initially**: All edges are removed → `n` isolated nodes → `n` components.  
2. **Add edges in descending order of `time`** (i.e., edges that would *survive* longer).  
3. Each addition potentially merges two components → `components--`.  
4. When you add an edge whose *time* is `t` and the component count drops **below** `k`, that means  
   *If we had removed all edges with `time <= t`, we would **not** have merged this edge → we’d still have ≥ k components.*  
   Therefore, `t` is the **minimum** time that guarantees at least `k` components.

> **Why reverse?**  
>  * Removing edges → time grows, components increase.  
>  * Adding edges backwards → time decreases, components decrease.  
>  * The first moment we cross the threshold gives the answer directly.

---

### 2.4 Data Structure – Disjoint Set Union (Union‑Find)

* **Find** with path compression.  
* **Union** by rank (or size).  
* Guarantees near‑constant amortized time: `α(n)` (inverse Ackermann).

> **Time to remember**:  
> *In interviews, you can mention “DSU”, “Union‑Find”, “path compression”, “rank‑by‑size” as a signal that you know the classic trick for dynamic connectivity.*

### 2.5 Algorithm Step‑by‑Step

| Step | Action | Why? |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Sort `edges` by `time` descending. | Needed to process in reverse order. |
| 2 | Initialise DSU with `n` nodes; set `components = n`. | Start from fully disconnected graph. |
| 3 | For each edge `[u, v, t]` in sorted list: | Add edge that *survives* the longest. |
| 4 | If `union(u, v)` succeeds → `components--`. | Two separate components merged. |
| 5 | If after the merge `components < k` → **return `t`**. | We just fell below the required threshold. |
| 6 | After loop → return `0`. | The graph never needed any edge to be added to reach ≥ k components. |

---

### 2.5 Full Code – Pick Your Language

*Java* – `Solution` class with internal `DSU` helper.  
*Python* – `DSU` class + `Solution` method.  
*C++* – `DSU` class + `Solution::minTime`.

> **Note**: All three code snippets above are in the “full” section; copy‑paste them directly into your IDE.

---

### 2.6 Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Sorting edges | **O(m log m)** (with `m = edges.length`) | `O(1)` extra beyond input |
| DSU operations | **O((n + m) α(n))** ≈ **O(n + m)** | `O(n)` for parent & rank arrays |
| Total | **O((n + m) log m)** (sorting dominates) | **O(n + m)** |

With `n, m ≤ 10⁵`, this easily fits into the 2 s / 512 MB limits of LeetCode.

---

### 2.7 “The Bad” – Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why it happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Sorting in ascending order** | Adds edges that disappear *earlier* → component count *increases* → algorithm never sees a “drop below `k`”. | Sort **descending** (`b[2] - a[2]`). |
| **Missing path compression** | Union‑Find degrades to O(n) per operation for skewed trees → TLE. | Use path compression (`find(x) = parent[x]==x?x:parent[x]=find(parent[x])`). |
| **Using size incorrectly** | Always attaching larger tree to smaller one leads to rank mis‑balance if you ignore size. | Union‑by‑rank or union‑by‑size; update rank/size accordingly. |
| **Returning wrong time** | Returning `t` **after** component count *remains* ≥ `k` instead of `< k`. | Return only when `components` *drops below* `k`. |
| **Assuming `k==1` needs special case** | Actually answer is always `0` if the graph starts with `n` components; the loop covers it. | No special case needed. |

---

### 2.8 “The Ugly” – Why Some People Write It Wrong

1. **Binary Search + Online**  
   *Many candidates try to binary‑search over `t` and rebuild the DSU every iteration.*  
   *Result*: `O(m log T)` with `T = 10⁹` → ~30 rebuilds → 3 × 10⁶ union operations → **TLE**.  
   **Lesson**: Avoid per‑iteration DSU rebuilds; use *offline* reverse processing.

2. **Adjacency List + DFS per removal**  
   *Removing edges one by one and recomputing components with DFS gives `O(m n)` – hopeless.*  
   **Lesson**: The graph is *dynamic*, use a data structure that supports *dynamic connectivity* in near‑linear time.

3. **Using a map from time → edges**  
   *Storing edges in a map keyed by time and iterating over time values can lead to O(T) loop.*  
   **Lesson**: Never iterate over all possible times; process only existing edges.

### 2.9 Interview‑Ready Tips

| Tip | Explanation |
|-----|-------------|
| **Say your plan out loud** | “I’ll sort edges, then walk backwards adding them while keeping a DSU.” |
| **Mention Union‑Find by name** | “This is a classic DSU problem.” |
| **Explain the reverse logic** | “Adding edges in reverse lets us see when we cross the threshold.” |
| **Mention path compression** | “It gives almost O(1) amortized ops.” |
| **Complexity talk** | “Sorting dominates – O(m log m). DSU is linear.” |
| **Edge cases** | “If `k` equals `n`, answer is always `0`.” |
| **Why offline?** | “We don’t need to simulate each time unit; we jump directly to the only relevant edges.” |

---

### 2.10 Quick‑Code Checklist

| Language | DSU implementation | Sorting |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Java** | `parent[]` + `rank[]` + path comp | `Arrays.sort(edges, (a,b)->b[2]-a[2])` |
| **Python** | class DSU | `edges.sort(key=lambda e: -e[2])` |
| **C++** | `vector<int> p, r` | `sort(edges.begin(), edges.end(), cmp)` where `cmp` orders by `time` descending |

---

### 2.11 Conclusion

> The “Minimum Time for K Connected Components” problem is a beautiful illustration of how offline processing + Union‑Find can transform a seemingly dynamic removal question into a simple linear sweep.  

> Mastering this pattern will make you confident in any graph + DSU interview. Plus, you now have **three ready‑to‑paste** solutions in Java, Python, and C++ – exactly what recruiters look for.

> 🚀 **Takeaway**: *Reverse the problem* → *DSU keeps components* → *first crossing point is the answer*.  
> And that’s the secret sauce you can confidently explain in a coding interview.

--- 

### 2.12 Final Thought

If you’re preparing for your next interview, practice this pattern on other LeetCode graph problems, such as **Number of Islands (DFS/BFS)**, **Connected Components in Undirected Graph** (`207. Course Schedule`), and the **Dynamic Connectivity** family. The more you can *visualize adding* or *removing* edges, the easier it becomes to spot the reverse‑process trick.  

Good luck, and may your DSU always find the right parent! 🚀
