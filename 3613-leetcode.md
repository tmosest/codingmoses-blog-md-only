        ## 1.  Three‑Language Solutions for **LeetCode 3613 – Minimize Maximum Component Cost**

The problem is a classic “cut‑the‑heaviest‑edges” question.  
The optimal strategy is to keep the lightest edges and cut the heaviest ones until the graph is split into at most `k` components.  
A **Disjoint‑Set Union (DSU)** (Union‑Find) data structure gives a clean, linear‑ith solution.

Below you’ll find three complete, ready‑to‑copy solutions:

| Language | Key idea | Time | Space |
|----------|----------|------|-------|
| **Java** | Sort edges by weight, union until `components ≤ k`. | `O(m log m)` | `O(n + m)` |
| **Python** | Same DSU logic, using path compression and union by size. | `O(m log m)` | `O(n + m)` |
| **C++** | DSU with rank/path compression. | `O(m log m)` | `O(n + m)` |

### 1.1 Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    // ---------- DSU ----------
    private static class DSU {
        int[] parent, size;
        DSU(int n) {
            parent = new int[n];
            size   = new int[n];
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                parent[i] = i;
                size[i]   = 1;
            }
        }
        int find(int x) {
            if (parent[x] != x) parent[x] = find(parent[x]);   // path compression
            return parent[x];
        }
        boolean union(int a, int b) {
            a = find(a);
            b = find(b);
            if (a == b) return false;
            if (size[a] < size[b]) { int t = a; a = b; b = t; }
            parent[b] = a;
            size[a]  += size[b];
            return true;
        }
    }

    // ---------- Main ----------
    public int minCost(int n, int[][] edges, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(edges, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[2], b[2])); // sort by weight
        DSU dsu = new DSU(n);
        int comps = n;          // initially n components (each vertex alone)
        int answer = 0;         // weight of the last added edge

        for (int[] e : edges) {
            if (comps <= k) break;          // already satisfied
            if (dsu.union(e[0], e[1])) {    // we added a new edge
                comps--;
                answer = e[2];              // this is the max edge so far
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```

### 1.2 Python

```python
class DSU:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.size   = [1] * n

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])   # path compression
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, a, b):
        a, b = self.find(a), self.find(b)
        if a == b:
            return False
        if self.size[a] < self.size[b]:
            a, b = b, a
        self.parent[b] = a
        self.size[a]  += self.size[b]
        return True

class Solution:
    def minCost(self, n: int, edges: list[list[int]], k: int) -> int:
        edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])          # sort by weight
        dsu = DSU(n)
        comps = n
        answer = 0

        for u, v, w in edges:
            if comps <= k:
                break
            if dsu.union(u, v):
                comps -= 1
                answer = w
        return answer
```

### 1.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class DSU {
public:
    vector<int> parent, sz;
    DSU(int n) : parent(n), sz(n, 1) {
        iota(parent.begin(), parent.end(), 0);
    }
    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) parent[x] = find(parent[x]);   // path compression
        return parent[x];
    }
    bool unite(int a, int b) {
        a = find(a);
        b = find(b);
        if (a == b) return false;
        if (sz[a] < sz[b]) swap(a, b);
        parent[b] = a;
        sz[a]   += sz[b];
        return true;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int k) {
        sort(edges.begin(), edges.end(),
             [](const vector<int>& x, const vector<int>& y){ return x[2] < y[2]; });

        DSU dsu(n);
        int comps = n;
        int answer = 0;

        for (auto &e : edges) {
            if (comps <= k) break;
            if (dsu.unite(e[0], e[1])) {
                --comps;
                answer = e[2];
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
};
```

> **Why DSU?**  
> After we “exclude” all edges we have `n` components.  
> Re‑inserting edges in increasing weight order only *merges* components, never splits them.  
> As soon as the number of components becomes `≤ k`, the last inserted edge is the heaviest edge that must stay in the graph – that is exactly the answer.

## 2.  A Quick Alternative: Binary Search + DFS

If you prefer a more “mathy” solution, you can binary‑search on the answer and use DFS/BFS to count components after cutting all edges heavier than the current mid‑value.  
That runs in `O(m log W + (n+m) log W)` where `W` is the maximum edge weight – perfectly fine for the constraints but a bit more involved.

> **When to use this?**  
> • When you want a solution that works for *any* graph (even when it isn’t guaranteed to be connected).  
> • When you want to avoid sorting all edges (e.g., huge `m` but small weight range).  
> But for LeetCode 3613, the DSU solution is both simpler and faster.

### 3.1 Blog

> **Introduction**  
> In the world of coding interviews, *graph problems* frequently appear. One of the trickiest LeetCode challenges is **3613 – Minimize Maximum Component Cost**.  
> It asks you to partition a connected graph into at most `k` components while keeping the *lightest* possible maximum edge weight.  
> The solution is surprisingly elegant once you spot the “cut the heaviest edges” insight.

> **Why LeetCode 3613 is a Gold‑mine for Interviews**  
> *  It tests understanding of **graph connectivity** (components, cycles, and paths).  
> *  It blends **sorting**, **Union‑Find**, and **binary search** – all staple concepts in technical interviews.  
> *  It’s a real‑world problem: network design, road maintenance, or even social‑network segmentation.

## 3.2 Good – Why the DSU Approach Works

1. **Linear time after sorting** – Every edge is considered once; union‑find operations are almost O(1) thanks to path compression & union by size/rank.  
2. **Deterministic answer** – Sorting edges ascending guarantees that the *maximum* edge weight we keep is the heaviest among the chosen edges.  
3. **Clear logic** – “Start with all vertices isolated, add the lightest edges until you have ≤ k components” is an intuitive narrative for interviewers.  
4. **Minimal code** – One small DSU helper, a sort, and a single loop. Perfect for a white‑board.

## 3.3 Bad – Things to Watch Out For

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Not sorting** – If you add edges in arbitrary order you might merge heavy edges first and over‑cut, leading to a wrong answer. | `sort(edges, key=lambda x: x[2])` |
| **DSU bug** – Forgetting path compression can push you to `O(n)` per operation. | Always implement `find(x)` with path compression. |
| **Edge case `k = n`** – You might think you need to add no edges. The answer should be `0`. The loop handles this automatically (`comps ≤ k` breaks before any union). |
| **Large weight range** – Using 32‑bit integers is safe because `wi ≤ 10^5` in the constraints. |

---

## 3.4 Ugly – When Things Go Wrong

1. **TLE on massive inputs** – Using a naïve DFS for every binary‑search step (O((n+m) log W)) can exceed time limits if `m` is close to 2×10⁵.  
2. **DSU implementation mistakes** – Incorrect union logic (e.g., forgetting to decrement `comps`) results in wrong answers or infinite loops.  
3. **Missing component count** – In the binary‑search approach you must carefully count components after cutting edges. Failing to do so gives a `k` that is actually larger than intended.

---

## 4.  Why the DSU Solution is Your Interview MVP

* **Speed** – `O(m log m)` sort dominates, but the merge loop is linear.  
* **Simplicity** – A single loop, one DSU helper, no need for recursion or stack tricks.  
* **Portability** – Works unchanged in Java, Python, and C++.  
* **Explain‑ability** – You can articulate the “add the lightest edge until you reach `k` components” strategy, which is exactly what most interviewers want to see.
