## 📌 Problem Recap

You’re given two categories of theme‑park attractions:

| Category | Array | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Land rides** | `landStartTime[i]` | Earliest boarding time of the *i*‑th land ride |
| | `landDuration[i]` | How long the *i*‑th land ride lasts |
| **Water rides** | `waterStartTime[j]` | Earliest boarding time of the *j*‑th water ride |
| | `waterDuration[j]` | How long the *j*‑th water ride lasts |

A tourist must experience **exactly one** ride from each category (order is flexible).  
A ride may start at its opening time or any later time.  
After finishing one ride, the tourist can start the other immediately if it is already open or wait for it to open.

> **Goal** – Return the earliest possible finish time of the two rides.

Constraints  
`1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`, all times and durations are in `[1, 1000]`.

## 🔎 Intuition – Why a Linear Scan Works

For any sequence (land first → water, or water first → land) we only need to know the *earliest* finish time of the first category, **not** each individual ride:

1. **Land first**  
   *Start* the earliest‑finishing land ride at its opening time → finish at `min(landStart[i] + landDuration[i])`.  
   For every water ride `j`, the tourist will finish land first and then start water at  
   `max(minLandFinish, waterStart[j])` (wait if needed).  
   Finish time for that combination = `waterDuration[j] + max(minLandFinish, waterStart[j])`.

2. **Water first**  
   Symmetric: use `minWaterFinish` and iterate over land rides.

Taking the minimum of the two sets gives the answer.  
No pairwise comparison (`O(n*m)`) is necessary → **O(n + m)**.

---

## 🧮 Algorithm Steps

1. Compute `minLandFinish = min(landStart[i] + landDuration[i])`.
2. Compute `minWaterFinish = min(waterStart[j] + waterDuration[j])`.
3. **Land first → Water**  
   For each water ride `j`:  
   `ans = min(ans, waterDuration[j] + max(minLandFinish, waterStart[j]))`.
4. **Water first → Land**  
   For each land ride `i`:  
   `ans = min(ans, landDuration[i] + max(minWaterFinish, landStart[i]))`.
5. Return `ans`.

## 📦 Code Implementations

### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public int earliestFinishTime(int[] landStartTime, int[] landDuration,
                                  int[] waterStartTime, int[] waterDuration) {
        int n = landStartTime.length;
        int m = waterStartTime.length;
        int minLandFinish = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int minWaterFinish = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        // earliest land finish
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            minLandFinish = Math.min(minLandFinish,
                    landStartTime[i] + landDuration[i]);
        }

        // earliest water finish
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            minWaterFinish = Math.min(minWaterFinish,
                    waterStartTime[j] + waterDuration[j]);
        }

        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        // land first → water
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            int finish = waterDuration[j] + Math.max(minLandFinish, waterStartTime[j]);
            ans = Math.min(ans, finish);
        }

        // water first → land
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int finish = landDuration[i] + Math.max(minWaterFinish, landStartTime[i]);
            ans = Math.min(ans, finish);
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def earliestFinishTime(self,
                           landStartTime: list[int],
                           landDuration: list[int],
                           waterStartTime: list[int],
                           waterDuration: list[int]) -> int:
        min_land_finish = min(s + d for s, d in zip(landStartTime, landDuration))
        min_water_finish = min(s + d for s, d in zip(waterStartTime, waterDuration))

        ans = float('inf')

        # land first → water
        for ws, wd in zip(waterStartTime, waterDuration):
            finish = wd + max(min_land_finish, ws)
            ans = min(ans, finish)

        # water first → land
        for ls, ld in zip(landStartTime, landDuration):
            finish = ld + max(min_water_finish, ls)
            ans = min(ans, finish)

        return ans
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int earliestFinishTime(vector<int>& landStartTime, vector<int>& landDuration,
                           vector<int>& waterStartTime, vector<int>& waterDuration) {
        int n = landStartTime.size(), m = waterStartTime.size();

        int minLandFinish = INT_MAX, minWaterFinish = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            minLandFinish = min(minLandFinish, landStartTime[i] + landDuration[i]);

        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j)
            minWaterFinish = min(minWaterFinish, waterStartTime[j] + waterDuration[j]);

        int ans = INT_MAX;

        // land first → water
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            int finish = waterDuration[j] + max(minLandFinish, waterStartTime[j]);
            ans = min(ans, finish);
        }

        // water first → land
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int finish = landDuration[i] + max(minWaterFinish, landStartTime[i]);
            ans = min(ans, finish);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## 🚩 Edge‑Case Checklist

| Edge Case | Why it matters | Handling |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Multiple rides open at the same time | The “earliest finish” choice is still deterministic | `min` of sums captures the earliest finish |
| Zero wait time (ride already open after first) | Need to use `max` to avoid negative wait | `max(minFinish, openTime)` |
| Only one ride in each category | Algorithm still O(1) – works naturally | Loops run once |
| Large input (100 rides) | No overflow in Java/Python; use `INT_MAX` in C++ | All values ≤ 2000, safe for 32‑bit int |

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls for Beginners

1. **Mistaking “earliest finish” for “earliest start”** –  
   The greedy works on *finish* times, not just opening times.
2. **Using a nested loop** (`O(n*m)`) –  
   Works but is overkill and may trigger a TLE warning in the LeetCode platform (although constraints are small).
3. **Forgot to `max(minFinish, openTime)`** –  
   Causes wrong results when the first category finishes *after* the second ride’s opening time.
4. **Python `inf` vs `int`** –  
   Use `float('inf')` or a large constant; returning `int` is fine.

## 🎯 Why This Solution is a Show‑Stopper

| Aspect | How it Impresses Interviewers |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| **Linear time** – O(n + m) beats the naive O(n · m) and demonstrates big‑O awareness. |
| **Clear state** – Only two “global” minima are required. |
| **Language‑agnostic** – Implemented in Java, Python & C++ – perfect for a multi‑language portfolio. |
| **Readability** – Each loop has a single mathematical expression. |
| **Edge‑case safety** – No special handling required; the formula works for all inputs. |

## 💡 Take‑Away Summary

* **Good:** The problem is conceptually simple, yet the linear solution is a great example of *“solve for the optimal sub‑problem, then reuse it”*.
* **Bad:** A novice might attempt an `O(n*m)` brute force, overlooking that we only need the *earliest* finish of the first ride type.
* **Ugly:** Careless use of `max`/`min` can lead to off‑by‑one waiting errors, especially when rides open at the same timestamp.
