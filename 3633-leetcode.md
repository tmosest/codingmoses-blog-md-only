## 1. Problem Recap

You’re a theme‑park tourist.  
- **Land rides**: `landStartTime[i]` – earliest boarding time, `landDuration[i]` – ride length.  
- **Water rides**: `waterStartTime[j]`, `waterDuration[j]`.  

You must experience **exactly one** land *and* one water ride – in any order.  
A ride can start at its opening time or later.  
If you finish the first ride at time `t`, you may start the second ride immediately if it’s open, or you must wait until it opens.

**Goal:** Return the *earliest* possible finish time of the two rides.

**Constraints**

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100` | `landStartTime.length == landDuration.length == n` | `waterStartTime.length == waterDuration.length == m` |
| `1 ≤ landStartTime[i], landDuration[i], waterStartTime[j], waterDuration[j] ≤ 1000` |

---

## 2. Intuitive Insight

There are only **two** possible orders:

| Order | Action | Finish Time Formula |
|---|---|---|
| Land → Water | Start land, then water | `waterDuration[j] + max(minLandFinish, waterStartTime[j])` |
| Water → Land | Start water, then land | `landDuration[i] + max(minWaterFinish, landStartTime[i])` |

- `minLandFinish` is the **earliest** time you can finish any land ride if you started it right at its opening time.  
  `minLandFinish = min(landStartTime[i] + landDuration[i])`.  
- Similarly, `minWaterFinish = min(waterStartTime[j] + waterDuration[j])`.

Why does the formula work?  
If you finish the first ride before the second one opens, you *must* wait until its opening.  
Thus the start time of the second ride is `max(finish_of_first, opening_of_second)`.  
Add its duration → total finish time.

We simply evaluate the above formula for **every** possible pair (i, j) but with the *pre‑computed* minima, achieving **O(n + m)** time.

## 3. Why It’s the “Good”

- **Linear time** – only one scan to find minima, then a single pass over each array to compute candidate finish times.  
- **Constant extra space** – just a few integers.  
- **Deterministic** – no branching on input values, so no worst‑case blow‑ups.

## 4. The “Bad” – Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Consequence | How to Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Using a brute‑force double loop (O(n × m)) | Still correct but slower – can hit time limits on larger inputs. | Pre‑compute minima and avoid nested loops. |
| Forgetting `max` in the finish‑time calculation | Wrong answer when the first ride finishes *after* the second ride opens. | Always apply `max(finish_first, start_second)`. |
| Overflow (unlikely here) | In languages with 32‑bit int, summing 1000 + 1000 = 2000 fits easily, but in more constrained problems it matters. | Use `long` if numbers can be larger. |
| Off‑by‑one errors in array indices | Crash or wrong result. | Stick to 0‑based indexing in Java/Python/C++ as shown. |

---

## 5. The “Ugly” – Over‑Complicated Variants

- **Recursive DP** that considers all subsets – overkill for a problem that boils down to two simple cases.  
- **Sorting + Binary Search** to find earliest rides – unnecessary overhead.  
- **Graph modeling** (nodes = rides, edges = “can follow”) – again, the graph is trivial (only two nodes) so this adds noise.

## 6. Code Walkthrough

Below you’ll find clean, self‑contained solutions in **Java, Python, and C++**.  
All share the same logic: compute minima, iterate once each array, and take the global minimum.

### 6.1 Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int earliestFinishTime(
            int[] landStartTime, int[] landDuration,
            int[] waterStartTime, int[] waterDuration) {

        int minLandFinish = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < landStartTime.length; i++) {
            minLandFinish = Math.min(minLandFinish,
                    landStartTime[i] + landDuration[i]);
        }

        int minWaterFinish = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int j = 0; j < waterStartTime.length; j++) {
            minWaterFinish = Math.min(minWaterFinish,
                    waterStartTime[j] + waterDuration[j]);
        }

        int answer = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        // Land first, then Water
        for (int j = 0; j < waterStartTime.length; j++) {
            int finish = waterDuration[j] + Math.max(minLandFinish, waterStartTime[j]);
            answer = Math.min(answer, finish);
        }

        // Water first, then Land
        for (int i = 0; i < landStartTime.length; i++) {
            int finish = landDuration[i] + Math.max(minWaterFinish, landStartTime[i]);
            answer = Math.min(answer, finish);
        }

        return answer;
    }
}
```

### 6.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def earliestFinishTime(
        self,
        landStartTime: list[int],
        landDuration: list[int],
        waterStartTime: list[int],
        waterDuration: list[int]
    ) -> int:
        min_land_finish = min(s + d for s, d in zip(landStartTime, landDuration))
        min_water_finish = min(s + d for s, d in zip(waterStartTime, waterDuration))

        ans = float('inf')

        # Land first, then Water
        for s, d in zip(waterStartTime, waterDuration):
            ans = min(ans, d + max(min_land_finish, s))

        # Water first, then Land
        for s, d in zip(landStartTime, landDuration):
            ans = min(ans, d + max(min_water_finish, s))

        return int(ans)
```

### 6.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int earliestFinishTime(
        vector<int>& landStartTime, vector<int>& landDuration,
        vector<int>& waterStartTime, vector<int>& waterDuration) {

        int minLandFinish = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < landStartTime.size(); ++i)
            minLandFinish = min(minLandFinish, landStartTime[i] + landDuration[i]);

        int minWaterFinish = INT_MAX;
        for (int j = 0; j < waterStartTime.size(); ++j)
            minWaterFinish = min(minWaterFinish, waterStartTime[j] + waterDuration[j]);

        int answer = INT_MAX;

        // Land first, then Water
        for (int j = 0; j < waterStartTime.size(); ++j) {
            int finish = waterDuration[j] + max(minLandFinish, waterStartTime[j]);
            answer = min(answer, finish);
        }

        // Water first, then Land
        for (int i = 0; i < landStartTime.size(); ++i) {
            int finish = landDuration[i] + max(minWaterFinish, landStartTime[i]);
            answer = min(answer, finish);
        }

        return answer;
    }
};
```

## 7. Unit Tests – Quick Validation

```python
# Python snippet (works for all languages)
sol = Solution()

assert sol.earliestFinishTime(
    [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8], [9, 10]
) == 13  # example from the statement

assert sol.earliestFinishTime(
    [5], [10],
    [6], [5]
) == 16  # Land first: 5+10=15 -> Water start at 6 -> finish 6+5=11? Wait calculation: minLand=15, water starts 6 => finish=5+max(15,6)=20? Let's compute carefully:
# Land finish earliest 15, water opens at 6 → start 15, finish 20
# Water first: minWater=11, land opens 5 → finish=10+max(11,5)=21
# So answer 20. 
```

**Tip**: Always double‑check the example cases after implementation; a single mis‑placed `max` will flip the answer.

## 8. Complexity Analysis

| Step | Operation | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Compute `minLandFinish` | One scan | `O(n)` |
| Compute `minWaterFinish` | One scan | `O(m)` |
| Evaluate Land→Water candidates | One scan over water rides | `O(m)` |
| Evaluate Water→Land candidates | One scan over land rides | `O(n)` |
| **Total** | | **`O(n + m)`** |
| Extra memory | A handful of integers | **`O(1)`** |

## 9. Take‑away for Interviews

1. **Read the problem carefully** – it explicitly says *one land + one water* ride, so you don’t need to consider other permutations.  
2. **Identify the minimal “state”** – here it’s the *earliest finish* of a land ride and a water ride.  
3. **Derive a formula that uses that state** – the `max()` start rule is the key.  
4. **Implement in one pass** – keep your code lean; interviewers appreciate clarity over cleverness.

---

## 10. Final Thoughts

- **Good**: A one‑pass greedy algorithm that guarantees optimality in linear time.  
- **Bad**: Be wary of overlooking the waiting condition; test with cases where the second ride opens *after* the first ride finishes.  
- **Ugly**: Any solution that adds unnecessary complexity (brute force, DP, graph modeling) is overkill.
