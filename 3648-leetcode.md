        ## 🎯 3648. Minimum Sensors to Cover Grid – LeetCode – One‑liner, O(1) Solution  

Below you’ll find **ready‑to‑paste code** in **Java, Python, and C++** that solves the problem in constant time.  
After the code you’ll find a **SEO‑optimized blog post** that explains the intuition, the pitfalls (“good, bad & ugly”), and how this interview technique can help you land that next job.

## 1. LeetCode Problem Recap

**Problem**  
> Given an `n × m` grid and an integer `k`, a sensor placed at `(r, c)` covers every cell whose **Chebyshev distance** to `(r, c)` is at most `k`.  
> Return the **minimum number of sensors** required to cover the whole grid.

**Chebyshev distance** = `max(|r1-r2| , |c1-c2|)` – the “king’s move” distance on a chessboard.

## 2. One‑liner Insight

*Each sensor covers a square of side `2k + 1`.*  
If we lay sensors on a regular grid with spacing `2k + 1`, we never waste coverage.  
Thus the minimum number of sensors is simply:

```
ceil(n / (2k+1))  *  ceil(m / (2k+1))
```

`ceil(x)` can be computed with integer math: `x / size + (x % size > 0 ? 1 : 0)`.

## 3. Code – Java / Python / C++

### 3.1 Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSensors(int n, int m, int k) {
        int size = 2 * k + 1;                    // side of the coverage square
        int horiz = n / size + (n % size > 0 ? 1 : 0);
        int vert  = m / size + (m % size > 0 ? 1 : 0);
        return horiz * vert;
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minSensors(self, n: int, m: int, k: int) -> int:
        size = 2 * k + 1
        horiz = n // size + (1 if n % size else 0)
        vert  = m // size + (1 if m % size else 0)
        return horiz * vert
```

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSensors(int n, int m, int k) {
        int size = 2 * k + 1;
        int horiz = n / size + (n % size ? 1 : 0);
        int vert  = m / size + (m % size ? 1 : 0);
        return horiz * vert;
    }
};
```

All three snippets run in **O(1)** time and **O(1)** memory.

## 4. Blog Article – “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Grid‑Covering Sensors”

### 4.1 Title (SEO‑Optimized)

> **“Minimum Sensors to Cover Grid – The O(1) Solution Everyone Needs for LeetCode & Interviews”**

### 4.2 Meta Description

> Solve LeetCode 3648 in one line. Learn the greedy strategy, pitfalls to avoid, and why this “grid‑covering sensors” trick shines in coding interviews. Boost your algorithm skills for tech roles.

### 4.3 Introduction

In coding interviews, you’re often asked to “cover” a board, a graph, or a 2‑D array with the fewest pieces.  
LeetCode’s **3648 – Minimum Sensors to Cover Grid** is a textbook example: a sensor covers a square area, and we must minimize the count.

The trick is simple yet powerful: **treat the problem as a tiling of squares**.  
Below, I walk you through the intuition, the edge cases, the common mistakes (the “bad” and “ugly”), and the clean O(1) solution that will get you the “Yes” in your next interview.

### 4.4 Problem Statement (Bullet‑Points)

* Grid dimensions: `n × m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10³).  
* Sensor coverage radius: `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 10³).  
* Chebyshev distance = `max(|Δrow|, |Δcol|)` – like a chess king.  
* Return **minimum sensors** needed to cover every cell.

### 4.5 The Good: Why the Greedy Square Tiling Works

1. **Coverage Shape**  
   A sensor at `(r, c)` covers a square centered at that cell with side `2k + 1`.  
   Think of each sensor as a “tile” of that fixed size.

2. **Optimality of Regular Spacing**  
   If we place sensors so that their centers are exactly `2k + 1` cells apart horizontally and vertically, the tiles touch (no gaps, no unnecessary overlap).  
   Any other placement would either leave gaps or create wasted overlap.

3. **Mathematical Formula**  
   *Horizontal tiles needed*: `ceil(n / (2k+1))`  
   *Vertical tiles needed*: `ceil(m / (2k+1))`  
   Multiply → total sensors.

4. **Why It’s O(1)**  
   All we do is a few arithmetic operations and a couple of integer divisions.

### 4.6 The Bad: Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Using `n / size` without ceiling** | Integer division truncates. | `n = 5, size = 3 → 1` instead of `2`. |
| **Assuming sensors can be placed outside grid** | Chebyshev distance only counts cells, not positions. | Placing a sensor at (-1, -1) is illegal. |
| **Adding sensors unnecessarily** | Over‑covering cells wastes sensors. | Placing sensors at every cell when `k=0`. |
| **Mixing rows and columns** | `ceil(m / size)` vs `ceil(n / size)` swapped → wrong product. |

### 4.7 The Ugly: Over‑Complicated Approaches

Some solutions attempt to simulate placement, BFS, or use dynamic programming.  
These add:

* **O(n m)** or **O((n+m) log(n+m))** complexity – unnecessary for a simple math problem.
* Lots of edge‑case handling (partial coverage at borders, overlapping checks).
* Higher chance of bugs and longer interview time.

> **Bottom line**: Simplicity is elegance. A one‑liner arithmetic answer is the “clean” code recruiters want to see.

### 4.8 Code Walk‑through (Java, Python, C++)

(Insert the code blocks from section 3 here, each in a separate fenced code block.)

> **Tip**: In interviews, always explain the formula first, then show how you implement `ceil` in integer math. Recruiters appreciate the clarity.

### 4.9 Complexity Analysis

* **Time**: `O(1)` – constant operations regardless of grid size.  
* **Space**: `O(1)` – only a few integer variables.

### 4.10 Edge Cases to Test

| n | m | k | Expected sensors |
|---|---|---|------------------|
| 5 | 5 | 1 | 4 |
| 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| 1 | 10 | 0 | 10 |
| 1000 | 1000 | 0 | 1 000 000 |
| 1000 | 1000 | 500 | 1 |

### 4.11 How This Helps Your Job Hunt

* **Interview Impact**: Shows you can identify a greedy pattern and convert it to math.
* **Coding Style**: Clean, concise code – exactly what recruiters expect.
* **Algorithmic Breadth**: Tiling & covering problems appear in many real‑world scenarios (e.g., sensor networks, Wi‑Fi coverage).
* **Portfolio**: Add this solution to your GitHub with a short README – a quick showcase of problem‑solving skills.

### 4.12 Conclusion & Next Steps

> The **Minimum Sensors to Cover Grid** problem is a micro‑masterclass in turning geometry into arithmetic.  
> Remember: always look for the *tiling* or *covering* abstraction; it often leads to an `O(1)` or `O(log n)` solution.  
> Keep practicing similar “coverage” problems (e.g., “minimum number of lights to cover a hallway”) and you’ll be interview‑ready in no time.
