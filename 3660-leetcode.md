## 1. Problem Recap

> **You are given an integer array `nums`.**  
> From any index `i` you can jump to an index `j` according to:

| Direction | Condition | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `j > i`   | `nums[j] < nums[i]` | Jump forward only to a **smaller** element |
| `j < i`   | `nums[j] > nums[i]` | Jump backward only to a **larger** element |

> **Goal:** For each index `i`, find the maximum value you can reach by following any sequence of valid jumps starting at `i`. Return an array `ans` where `ans[i]` is that maximum reachable value.

> **Constraints**
> - `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁵`
> - `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁹`

---

## 2. Naïve Approach (Why It Fails)

A brute‑force DFS/BFS from every index would explore an exponential number of paths:  
`O(n²)` in the worst case (each index could reach many others).  
With `n = 10⁵`, that is absolutely infeasible.

---

## 3. The Insight – Prefix / Suffix

1. **Prefix Max (`pre[i]`)** – the largest element in the subarray `[0 … i]`.  
   When you jump left, you *always* end up at the maximum value seen so far.

2. **Suffix Min (`suff[i]`)** – the smallest element in the subarray `[i … n‑1]`.  
   When you jump right, you *must* land on a smaller element.  
   Therefore the *first* element you can reach on the right is the smallest value to the right.

3. **Why the comparison `pre[i] > suff[i+1]` matters**  
   - If the largest number on the left (`pre[i]`) is **greater** than the smallest number on the right (`suff[i+1]`), you can *first* jump left to `pre[i]` (gain a larger value) and *then* jump right to some position that eventually reaches `pre[i+1]`.  
   - Otherwise, you cannot benefit from jumping right after a left jump, so the best you can do is simply stay on the left side, giving you `pre[i]`.

With this observation we can compute the answer in a single backward scan.

---

## 4. Final Algorithm (O(n) Time, O(n) Space)

```text
pre[0] = nums[0]
for i = 1 … n-1:
    pre[i] = max(pre[i-1], nums[i])

suff[n-1] = nums[n-1]
for i = n-2 … 0:
    suff[i] = min(suff[i+1], nums[i])

ans[n-1] = pre[n-1]
for i = n-2 … 0:
    ans[i] = pre[i]                 // start with the best on the left
    if pre[i] > suff[i+1]:          // left jump can be followed by a right jump
        ans[i] = ans[i+1]           // inherit the best from the right side
return ans
```

---

## 5. Complexity Analysis

| Complexity | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| **Time**   | `O(n)` – single pass to compute `pre`, single pass for `suff`, single pass for answer. |
| **Space**  | `O(n)` – three integer arrays of length `n`. |

---

## 6. Edge Cases Handled

- Single‑element array → answer is the element itself.  
- All elements strictly increasing → you can only jump right to smaller numbers, so the answer is just the prefix max.  
- All elements strictly decreasing → you can only jump left to larger numbers, so the answer is the prefix max as well.  
- Repeated values → the algorithm still works because the conditions are strict inequalities (`<` / `>`).

## 7. Code Implementations

### 7.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] maxValue(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] pre = new int[n];
        int[] suff = new int[n];
        int[] ans = new int[n];

        pre[0] = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            pre[i] = Math.max(pre[i - 1], nums[i]);
        }

        suff[n - 1] = nums[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            suff[i] = Math.min(suff[i + 1], nums[i]);
        }

        ans[n - 1] = pre[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            ans[i] = pre[i];
            if (pre[i] > suff[i + 1]) {
                ans[i] = ans[i + 1];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

### 7.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def maxValue(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        pre = [0] * n
        suff = [0] * n
        ans = [0] * n

        pre[0] = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            pre[i] = max(pre[i - 1], nums[i])

        suff[n - 1] = nums[n - 1]
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            suff[i] = min(suff[i + 1], nums[i])

        ans[n - 1] = pre[n - 1]
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            ans[i] = pre[i]
            if pre[i] > suff[i + 1]:
                ans[i] = ans[i + 1]
        return ans
```

### 7.3 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> maxValue(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> pre(n), suff(n), ans(n);

        pre[0] = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            pre[i] = max(pre[i-1], nums[i]);

        suff[n-1] = nums[n-1];
        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; --i)
            suff[i] = min(suff[i+1], nums[i]);

        ans[n-1] = pre[n-1];
        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; --i) {
            ans[i] = pre[i];
            if (pre[i] > suff[i+1])
                ans[i] = ans[i+1];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

All three implementations run in **O(n)** time and **O(n)** auxiliary space, matching the optimal solution.

## 8. Blog Article: “The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly” of Jump Game IX

> **Target Audience:** Mid‑level software engineers, interview‑preparing candidates, and anyone who wants to master LeetCode problems for job interviews.

### 8.1 Introduction

> “What if you could leap over numbers in an array as long as you follow a simple rule?”  
> LeetCode 3660 – *Jump Game IX* – takes that question and turns it into a puzzle that blends greedy reasoning, prefix‑suffix tricks, and a touch of intuition. In this post we’ll dissect the problem, walk through the elegant solution, and learn why mastering this challenge gives you a competitive edge in technical interviews.

### 8.2 Problem Statement (Plain English)

- You’re standing at an index in an array of integers.
- If you want to jump **right**, the target must be **smaller** than your current value.
- If you want to jump **left**, the target must be **larger**.
- You can chain jumps arbitrarily long.
- For every starting index, what is the **maximum** number you can end up on?

### 8.3 The Naïve “I‑Will‑DFS” Approach (Why It’s *Bad*)

- **Time complexity:** `O(n²)` (each index explores many others).
- **Space complexity:** `O(n)` recursion stack or queue.
- With `n = 10⁵`, DFS/BFS would blow up fast.  
- Interviewers love to see you think about *time* and *space* upfront.

### 8.4 The “Good” Insight: Prefix Max & Suffix Min

1. **Prefix Max (`pre`)** – the best you can get by jumping only leftwards.  
   Because every left jump needs a larger number, you’ll inevitably end on the leftmost largest value seen so far.

2. **Suffix Min (`suff`)** – the smallest you could encounter if you jump rightwards.  
   A right jump requires a smaller number; the *first* such number you can hit is the minimum on the right side.

3. **Combining Them**  
   If the largest number on the left (`pre[i]`) is greater than the smallest number on the right (`suff[i+1]`), you can *first* take a left jump to `pre[i]` and then a right jump that will lead you to at least `pre[i+1]`.  
   Otherwise, you’re stuck on the left, and `pre[i]` is the answer.

### 8.5 The “Ugly” Edge: Strict Inequalities & Repeated Values

- Conditions are **strict** (`<` / `>`), not `≤` or `≥`.  
- Duplicate numbers don’t help you jump; the algorithm still respects the strict rules because we only use the `max` and `min` comparisons, which naturally discard duplicates.

### 8.6 Full Algorithm in One Sweep

- Compute `pre` in a forward pass.  
- Compute `suff` in a backward pass.  
- Resolve the answer by a backward scan using the comparison trick above.

> **Time:** `O(n)`  
> **Space:** `O(n)` (three auxiliary arrays).  
> This is *optimal* and *compact*, exactly what interviewers expect.

### 8.7 “Show‑Your‑Code” in Multiple Languages

- Java, Python, and C++ snippets demonstrate that the same logic is language‑agnostic.
- Highlight the *use of `Math.max` / `std::max`* and *`Math.min` / `std::min`* as micro‑optimizations.

### 8.8 What Interviewers Are Looking For

- **Problem comprehension** – re‑phrase the rules clearly.
- **Algorithm design** – explain why you need `O(n)` and not `O(n²)`.
- **Code clarity** – readable, well‑commented code.
- **Edge‑case awareness** – demonstrate that the algorithm holds for increasing, decreasing, and duplicate sequences.
- **Time‑space trade‑offs** – talk about auxiliary arrays vs. in‑place updates if you’re mindful of memory.

### 8.9 Take‑Away Tips for Your Next Interview

1. **Start with “What can you guarantee on the left?”** → `pre[i]`.  
2. **Ask “What is the first obstacle on the right?”** → `suff[i]`.  
3. **Compare & decide** – the comparison is the single line that unlocks the optimal path.  
4. **Practice a similar pattern** – many LeetCode problems (e.g., *Maximum Subarray*, *Sliding Window Maximum*) also rely on prefix/suffix precomputation.

### 8.10 Final Words

Jump Game IX isn’t just a single puzzle; it’s a **micro‑course in algorithmic elegance**.  
By turning a potentially exponential search into a linear pass through prefix and suffix arrays, you prove your ability to spot patterns and write efficient code – exactly what recruiters and hiring managers want.

> **Keep practicing**  
> Try to adapt the same prefix/suffix pattern to variations like *“Jump Game VI”* or *“Maximum Subarray with One Deletion”*.  
> The more patterns you internalize, the more confident you’ll feel when the next interview question lands on your desk.
