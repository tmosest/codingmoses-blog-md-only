        # 📌 LeetCode 3663 – “Find The Least Frequent Digit”  
### A Complete Guide, Code in Java / Python / C++, and a SEO‑Optimized Blog Post

---

## 🏁 Problem Summary  
**LeetCode ID:** 3663  
**Difficulty:** Easy  

> **Given an integer `n`, find the digit that occurs the least frequently in its decimal representation.**  
> If multiple digits share the minimal frequency, return the **smallest** of those digits.  

**Example**  
```
Input: n = 1553322
Output: 1          // 1 appears once; all other digits appear twice
```

---

## 📐 Solution Overview  
1. **Count** the occurrences of each digit (`0–9`).  
2. **Determine** the smallest frequency among those counts.  
3. **Select** the smallest digit that has that frequency.  

**Time Complexity:** `O(L)` where `L` is the number of decimal digits in `n` (at most 10 for a 32‑bit integer).  
**Space Complexity:** `O(1)` – we only need an array of length 10.

## 🧩 Code Implementations  

### 1️⃣ Java
```java
public class Solution {
    public int getLeastFrequentDigit(int n) {
        int[] freq = new int[10];                // frequency[0..9]
        int temp = n;

        // Count each digit
        while (temp > 0) {
            freq[temp % 10]++;
            temp /= 10;
        }

        int minFreq = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int f : freq) {
            if (f > 0 && f < minFreq) minFreq = f;
        }

        // Return the smallest digit with minimal frequency
        for (int digit = 0; digit < 10; digit++) {
            if (freq[digit] == minFreq) return digit;
        }
        return -1;   // should never reach here
    }
}
```

> **Why a `while` loop?**  
> It avoids converting the number to a `String` (no extra allocation).  
> The `if (f > 0)` guard ensures we ignore digits that never appear.

---

### 2️⃣ Python
```python
class Solution:
    def getLeastFrequentDigit(self, n: int) -> int:
        freq = [0] * 10
        temp = n

        # Count digits
        while temp:
            freq[temp % 10] += 1
            temp //= 10

        min_freq = min(f for f in freq if f > 0)
        for digit, f in enumerate(freq):
            if f == min_freq:
                return digit
```

> **Pythonic touch** – `min()` over a generator avoids an explicit loop for the minimum.

---

### 3️⃣ C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getLeastFrequentDigit(int n) {
        int freq[10] = {0};
        int temp = n;

        // Count each digit
        while (temp) {
            freq[temp % 10]++;
            temp /= 10;
        }

        int minFreq = INT_MAX;
        for (int f : freq)
            if (f > 0 && f < minFreq) minFreq = f;

        for (int digit = 0; digit < 10; ++digit)
            if (freq[digit] == minFreq) return digit;

        return -1; // unreachable
    }
};
```

## 📈 Complexity Analysis  

| Approach | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| Java | `O(L)` | `O(1)` |
| Python | `O(L)` | `O(1)` |
| C++ | `O(L)` | `O(1)` |

Since `L` ≤ 10 (32‑bit integer), the solution is effectively **constant time**.

---

## ⚖️ The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly  

| Category | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|----------|------|-----|------|
| **Simplicity** | Uses only an array of size 10. | Requires a guard to skip digits that never appear. | If `n` is 0, the loop skips counting and `minFreq` stays `MAX`. (Handled by the fact that `n ≥ 1` in constraints.) |
| **Performance** | Linear in digit count; fastest possible. | Extra loop to find min frequency – still negligible. | No need for hash maps, priority queues, or sorting. |
| **Readability** | Clear variable names (`freq`, `minFreq`). | Slight verbosity for three languages. | None – all versions are clean. |
| **Edge Cases** | Handles numbers with repeated digits, all digits the same, leading zeros not present. | Must ignore zeros that don't appear. | None. |

**Takeaway:** The O(1) array approach is the gold‑standard for this LeetCode problem. Avoid over‑engineering (e.g., using `HashMap`, `PriorityQueue`, or `String` conversions) – they only add complexity and micro‑slower runtime.

### Introduction  

Finding the least frequent digit in an integer may look trivial, but it’s a staple interview question on platforms like **LeetCode**. It tests your ability to:

- Work with integer manipulation
- Build frequency tables
- Handle edge cases cleanly

In this article, we’ll walk through a proven **O(n)** solution in **Java, Python, and C++**. Along the way, we’ll dissect the algorithm, discuss potential pitfalls, and share interview‑ready insights to help you land your next tech job.

### Problem Recap  

> **Given**: An integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 2^31-1`).  
> **Goal**: Return the digit (0‑9) that appears the fewest times in `n`’s decimal representation.  
> **Tie‑Breaker**: Return the smallest digit if multiple digits share the minimal frequency.

---

### Algorithm Deep Dive  

1. **Frequency Counting**  
   - Use a fixed‑size array (`freq[10]`) to hold counts for digits 0‑9.  
   - Iterate over the digits of `n` by repeatedly taking `n % 10` and dividing by 10.

2. **Find Minimum Frequency**  
   - Skip zero counts (digits that never appear).  
   - Track the smallest positive count.

3. **Select the Smallest Digit**  
   - Scan `freq` from 0 to 9 and return the first digit matching the minimal frequency.

Why is this optimal?  
- **Time**: Each digit is processed once – `O(L)` where `L` ≤ 10.  
- **Space**: Constant – array of size 10.

### Code Walkthrough  

(See the code snippets above for Java, Python, C++. Each implementation follows the same logic.)

> **Java Tips:**  
> - Use `while (temp > 0)` to avoid string conversions.  
> - `Integer.MAX_VALUE` safely initializes the minimum search.  

> **Python Tips:**  
> - List comprehension for counting: `[0] * 10`.  
> - `min(f for f in freq if f > 0)` cleanly ignores zeros.

> **C++ Tips:**  
> - `int freq[10] = {0};` initializes all entries to 0.  
> - Use `INT_MAX` from `<climits>`.

### Edge Cases & Testing  

| Test | Input | Output | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| Single digit | `n = 7` | `7` | Only one digit – it’s the least frequent by default. |
| All same digits | `n = 111111` | `0` | No zero digits appear; the smallest digit with minimal frequency is `0` (frequency 0). |
| Multiple minima | `n = 723344511` | `2` | Digits 7, 2, 5 appear once; smallest is 2. |
| Large number | `n = 2147483647` | `8` | Frequency analysis shows 8 appears once, others at least twice. |

Always validate that the algorithm handles numbers up to the 32‑bit max and that the return value is always a digit between 0 and 9.

### The Good, The Bad, The Ugly  

*Good* – O(1) extra space, no extra data structures, clear intent.  
*Bad* – Requires a two‑pass approach (counting then min‑search) which is still trivial but could be merged.  
*Ugly* – Over‑engineering (hash maps, priority queues) adds unnecessary complexity and risk of bugs.

---

### Interview Tips  

- **Explain the constraints**: Emphasize `n` fits in a 32‑bit signed integer → at most 10 digits.  
- **Show time/space complexity**: Highlight `O(L)` and constant space.  
- **Discuss edge cases**: Numbers with repeated digits, missing digits, leading zeros.  
- **Mention possible optimizations**: One‑pass approach by tracking min freq during counting, though not essential.
