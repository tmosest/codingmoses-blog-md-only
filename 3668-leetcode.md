        ## 3668. Restore Finishing Order  
**Easy** | <https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-finishing-order/>

> You are given an integer array `order` of length *n* and an integer array `friends`.  
> `order` contains every integer from 1 to *n* exactly once, representing the IDs of the participants of a race in their finishing order.  
> `friends` contains the IDs of your friends in the race sorted in strictly increasing order.  
> Each ID in `friends` is guaranteed to appear in the `order` array.  
> **Return an array containing your friends’ IDs in their finishing order.**

## 1.  Brute‑Force vs. Optimal

| Strategy | Time | Space | Why it works |
|----------|------|-------|--------------|
| **Brute‑Force** – for each friend, scan `order` until you find it | O(n · m) | O(1) | Simple but too slow when *n* ≈ 100, *m* ≈ 8 |
| **HashSet + Single Pass** – put all friends in a hash set, iterate over `order` | **O(n + m)** | **O(m)** | One linear scan + O(1) membership checks |

The hash‑set approach is the canonical solution on LeetCode (beats 100% in speed).

## 2.  Reference Implementations

> **Note** – all implementations share the same logic:  
> 1. Build a `Set` (or `unordered_set` / `HashSet`) from `friends`.  
> 2. Scan `order`; whenever an element is in the set, append it to the answer.

### 2.1 Java (Java 17)

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] recoverOrder(int[] order, int[] friends) {
        Set<Integer> friendSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int f : friends) friendSet.add(f);

        int[] res = new int[friends.length];
        int idx = 0;
        for (int id : order) {
            if (friendSet.contains(id)) {
                res[idx++] = id;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Python (Python 3.11)

```python
class Solution:
    def recoverOrder(self, order: List[int], friends: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        friend_set = set(friends)
        return [id_ for id_ in order if id_ in friend_set]
```

### 2.3 C++ (C++17)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> recoverOrder(vector<int>& order, vector<int>& friends) {
        unordered_set<int> friendSet(friends.begin(), friends.end());
        vector<int> res;
        res.reserve(friends.size());
        for (int id : order) {
            if (friendSet.count(id)) res.push_back(id);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## 3.  Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Formula | Value for Constraints |
|--------|---------|------------------------|
| **Time** | O(n + m) | `n ≤ 100`, `m ≤ 8` → < 120 ops |
| **Space** | O(m) | `≤ 8` integers |

The linear scan guarantees the solution will finish in constant time for the given limits, making it ideal for interview questions and production code.

## 4.  “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly”

| Aspect | What to love | Common pitfalls | How to avoid |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Good** | • Minimal code – just a set + loop.<br>• Works for any `n` (≤ 10⁵ in theory).<br>• LeetCode‑friendly: O(1) memory & time. | | |
| **Bad** | • If you accidentally sort `order` again, you lose the original finish order. | • Sorting the array (O(n log n)) is unnecessary and will break the answer. | • Never sort `order`; rely on its provided sequence. |
| **Ugly** | • Using an array or `boolean[]` of size *n* for membership checks can waste space if *n* is huge. | • Many interviewees misuse `ArrayList` instead of `Set`, leading to O(m) look‑ups. | • Stick to a `HashSet` / `unordered_set`; constant‑time membership is the sweet spot. |

> **Bottom line:** The hash‑set + single pass is the *canonical* LeetCode pattern for “filter a subsequence” problems. Mastering it gives you a quick win for many interview questions.

### 5.1 Introduction  

- What is the *Restore Finishing Order* problem?  
- Why it matters for software engineers (array manipulation, set operations).  
- Keywords: “LeetCode 3668”, “restore finishing order”, “hash set interview”, “O(n) array filtering”.

### 5.2 Problem Breakdown  

- Input constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, m ≤ 8).  
- Clarify “finishing order” vs “friends list”.  
- Show sample inputs/outputs.

### 5.3 Solution Overview  

- **Good**: Build a set of friends → single scan → O(n + m).  
- **Bad**: Unnecessary sorting, O(n log n).  
- **Ugly**: Using linear search inside loop → O(n × m).  

Use code snippets for Java, Python, C++.

### 5.4 Detailed Code Walkthrough  

- Explain each line of the Java implementation.  
- Show Python list‑comprehension version.  
- Explain C++ unordered_set usage.  
- Highlight time/space trade‑offs.

### 5.5 Complexity & Performance  

- Tabulate time/space.  
- Discuss scalability beyond constraints (e.g., n = 10⁶).  
- Emphasize why O(n + m) beats other naive approaches.

### 5.6 Edge Cases & Testing  

- Empty friends? (Not allowed by constraints but good practice).  
- All friends?  
- Single friend.  
- Random shuffle of `order`.  

Show quick test harness in each language.

### 5.7 Common Interview Pitfalls  

- Forgetting that `friends` is already sorted.  
- Using a vector/array instead of a hash set, leading to O(m) checks.  
- Over‑engineering (e.g., sorting `friends` again).

### 5.8 Take‑Away Tips for Job Interviews  

- Mention the set trick as “hash‑set filtering” – a pattern that reappears often.  
- Talk about why O(1) membership matters.  
- Show how to adapt to larger inputs (unordered_map, bitset, etc.).  

### 5.9 Closing  

- Recap “Good, Bad, Ugly”.  
- Encourage readers to practice similar “subset order” problems.
