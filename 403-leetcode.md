        ## üöÄ LeetCode 403 ‚Äì Frog Jump  
### The ‚ÄúGood, the Bad, and the Ugly‚Äù ‚Äì A Deep‚ÄëDive with Code in Java, Python & C++

> **Problem** ‚Äì *Frog Jump*  
> The river is split into units. A frog starts on the first stone (position‚ÄØ0) and must reach the last stone.  
> The first jump must be exactly **1 unit**. After a jump of `k` units the next jump can be `k-1`, `k`, or `k+1`.  
> **Question** ‚Äì Can the frog reach the last stone?

> **Constraints**  
> - `2¬†‚â§¬†stones.length¬†‚â§¬†2000`  
> - `0¬†‚â§¬†stones[i]¬†<¬†2¬≥¬π`  
> - `stones` is strictly increasing and starts at `0`.

## üéØ Why This Problem Is a Gold‚ÄëMine for Interviews

1. **Dynamic Programming + Hashing** ‚Äì A classic combination that showcases your ability to blend data structures with DP.
2. **Edge‚ÄëCase Handling** ‚Äì First jump rule, jumps that would overshoot, handling missing stones.
3. **Space & Time Trade‚Äëoffs** ‚Äì You can discuss the naive recursive solution, memoization, and the efficient DP/HashMap approach.
4. **Real‚ÄëWorld Relevance** ‚Äì The idea of ‚Äúonly forward movement‚Äù and ‚Äúbounded jump length‚Äù pops up in navigation, game development, and robotics.

## üõ†Ô∏è The ‚ÄúGood‚Äù ‚Äì The Clean, Efficient DP Approach

The idea is to keep track of every *possible jump length* that can reach a particular stone.  
If a stone can be reached with a jump of `k`, then the next stone can be reached with jumps `k-1`, `k`, or `k+1`.

```text
reachable[stone] = set of jump lengths that can land on this stone
```

We iterate through the stones in order and for every stored jump length we try the three possibilities, adding them to the corresponding destination stone if it exists.

### Complexity
- **Time**: `O(n¬≤)` in the worst case (each stone may have up to `O(n)` jump lengths).  
- **Space**: `O(n¬≤)` for the sets in the worst case, but practically far less due to the strict increasing order of stones.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The ‚ÄúBad‚Äù ‚Äì Recursive Backtracking (Too Slow for Large Inputs)

A simple DFS that tries all 3 options at every step will quickly explode, especially when `stones.length` is close to 2000.  
- **Worst‚Äëcase exponential** (`3^n`).  
- **Stack overflow risk** in languages without tail‚Äëcall optimization.

> **Why It‚Äôs Bad**: While conceptually straightforward, it fails to meet LeetCode‚Äôs time limits.

---

## üß® The ‚ÄúUgly‚Äù ‚Äì Over‚ÄëOptimized One‚ÄëLiner HashSet Tricks

Some coders attempt to cram the entire DP into a single line or rely on nested ternary operators, sacrificing readability for brevity.

> **Why It‚Äôs Ugly**:  
> - Hard to maintain.  
> - Prone to bugs because you lose the logical flow.  
> - Difficult for interviewers to follow.

## üñ•Ô∏è Full Code ‚Äì Three Languages

Below you‚Äôll find **clean, production‚Äëready** solutions in **Java, Python, and C++**.  
All use the same DP + HashMap strategy and are ready to paste into the LeetCode editor.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Java ‚Äì Optimal DP with `HashMap<Integer, HashSet<Integer>>`

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean canCross(int[] stones) {
        int n = stones.length;
        // Map from stone position to set of reachable jump lengths
        Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> reachable = new HashMap<>();
        for (int pos : stones) {
            reachable.put(pos, new HashSet<>());
        }
        reachable.get(0).add(1);  // First jump must be 1

        for (int pos : stones) {
            for (int jump : reachable.get(pos)) {
                // Try k-1, k, k+1
                for (int nextJump = jump - 1; nextJump <= jump + 1; nextJump++) {
                    if (nextJump <= 0) continue;           // No backward jumps
                    int nextPos = pos + nextJump;
                    if (reachable.containsKey(nextPos)) {
                        reachable.get(nextPos).add(nextJump);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        // If the last stone has any reachable jump length, we succeeded
        return !reachable.get(stones[n - 1]).isEmpty();
    }
}
```

**Why it‚Äôs good**  
- No global `dp` array ‚Üí uses only the stones that exist.  
- `HashSet` avoids duplicates automatically.  
- Clear separation of concerns.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Python ‚Äì Dictionary of Sets

```python
class Solution:
    def canCross(self, stones: List[int]) -> bool:
        reachable = {pos: set() for pos in stones}
        reachable[0].add(1)                     # First jump

        for pos in stones:
            for jump in reachable[pos]:
                for nxt in (jump - 1, jump, jump + 1):
                    if nxt <= 0:
                        continue
                    nxt_pos = pos + nxt
                    if nxt_pos in reachable:
                        reachable[nxt_pos].add(nxt)

        return bool(reachable[stones[-1]])
```

*Python‚Äôs `dict` + `set` keep the implementation concise yet readable.*

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ C++ ‚Äì `unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>>`

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canCross(vector<int>& stones) {
        unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>> reach;
        for (int s : stones) reach[s] = {};

        reach[0].insert(1);                // First jump

        for (int s : stones) {
            for (int jump : reach[s]) {
                for (int nxt = jump - 1; nxt <= jump + 1; ++nxt) {
                    if (nxt <= 0) continue;
                    int nxtPos = s + nxt;
                    if (reach.count(nxtPos))
                        reach[nxtPos].insert(nxt);
                }
            }
        }
        return !reach[stones.back()].empty();
    }
};
```

## üìö Bonus: Why This Approach Is Interview‚ÄëFriendly

1. **Clear Thought Process** ‚Äì Start with *‚Äúwhat can reach a stone?‚Äù* and build the DP table from that.
2. **Showcase Data Structure Knowledge** ‚Äì Use of hash maps & sets demonstrates an understanding of average‚Äëcase O(1) lookup.
3. **Edge Cases** ‚Äì Handle negative jump lengths, missing stones, and the first‚Äëjump rule ‚Äì interviewers love candidates who anticipate corner cases.
4. **Scalability** ‚Äì Discuss how the algorithm would behave if `stones.length` doubled and why it still fits within typical time limits.
