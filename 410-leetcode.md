## Problem Overview
> **Split Array Largest Sum (LeetCode 410)**  
> *Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, split `nums` into `k` non‑empty contiguous sub‑arrays such that the **largest** sub‑array sum is minimized. Return that minimal largest sum.*

```
Input:  nums = [7,2,5,10,8], k = 2
Output: 18
Explanation: Best split -> [7,2,5] | [10,8]  (max sum = 18)
```

### Constraints
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| `nums.length` | 1 … 1 000 |
| `nums[i]` | 0 … 10⁶ |
| `k` | 1 … min(50, nums.length) |

---

## Brute‑Force Ideas (Why They Fail)
1. **Enumerate all split positions**  
   *Number of ways = C(n‑1, k‑1) → O(2ⁿ) for n≈1 000 – impossible.*

2. **Dynamic programming with O(n²·k)**  
   *Works for small n, but with n=1 000 and k=50 → ≈ 5 × 10⁸ operations → TLE.*

3. **Greedy adding until limit exceeded**  
   *Requires a pre‑chosen limit; we don’t know it a priori.*

The key observation: *the answer lies between the maximum element and the total sum of the array.* This allows us to perform a **binary search** on the answer.

---

## Optimal Approach: Binary Search on the Answer
1. **Lower bound (`left`)** – the largest single element (because each element must belong to some sub‑array).  
2. **Upper bound (`right`)** – the sum of all elements (one sub‑array).  

While `left ≤ right`:
- `mid = (left + right) / 2` – candidate maximum sum per sub‑array.
- **Greedy check**: iterate through `nums` accumulating a running sum; whenever adding the next element would exceed `mid`, start a new sub‑array (increase counter).  
- If the number of sub‑arrays needed ≤ `k`, we can try a smaller `mid` (`right = mid - 1`).
- Otherwise we need a larger `mid` (`left = mid + 1`).

The smallest feasible `mid` is the answer.

> **Why greedy works**  
> For a fixed `mid`, the greedy partitioning produces the **minimum** number of sub‑arrays. If that number is already > k, any smaller `mid` will also fail. Thus binary search is valid.

---

## Time & Space Complexity
| Metric | Complexity |
|--------|------------|
| **Time** | `O(n log S)` where `S = sum(nums)`. For given constraints, `log S` ≤ 30. |
| **Space** | `O(1)` (apart from input array). |

---

## Pitfalls & Edge Cases (The Ugly)

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| **Integer overflow** when summing up to `10⁶ * 10³ = 10⁹` (fits in `int`, but safer to use `long`). | Use `long` for cumulative sums and `mid`. |
| **k == 1** | Binary search will quickly converge to the total sum; greedy check returns 1 sub‑array. |
| **k == n** | Answer is the maximum element; binary search ends immediately. |
| **Zeros in array** | Works fine; greedy just keeps adding zero. |
| **Array of length 1** | `k` must be 1; answer is that element. |
| **Off‑by‑one in binary search** | Use `mid = left + (right - left) / 2` and adjust `right = mid - 1` / `left = mid + 1` accordingly. |

## Good‑Practice Tips for Interviews
1. **Explain the “search the answer” pattern** – many interviewers love seeing this idea.  
2. **Show the greedy helper clearly** – write a separate function `countSubarrays(maxSum)` that returns the number of needed sub‑arrays.  
3. **Discuss edge cases** – mention the `k == 1` and `k == n` special scenarios.  
4. **Time complexity justification** – show that binary search bounds are tight.  
5. **Mention alternative DP** – if asked, talk about the O(n²k) DP solution, then why we avoid it here.  

These points demonstrate both algorithmic insight and communication skills.

### Java
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    /** 
     * Count how many sub‑arrays are needed if we limit each to at most maxSum.
     */
    private int subArraysNeeded(int[] nums, int maxSum) {
        int count = 1;          // at least one sub‑array
        int current = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (current + num > maxSum) {
                count++;           // start new sub‑array
                current = num;     // first element of the new sub‑array
            } else {
                current += num;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public int splitArray(int[] nums, int k) {
        long left = 0, right = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            left = Math.max(left, num);
            right += num;
        }

        int answer = (int) right;          // upper bound fits in int
        while (left <= right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (subArraysNeeded(nums, (int) mid) <= k) {
                answer = (int) mid;      // try to lower the answer
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;          // need a larger allowed sum
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```

### Python 3
```python
class Solution:
    def splitArray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Helper: count sub‑arrays if max allowed sum is limit
        def needed(limit: int) -> int:
            count, cur = 1, 0
            for x in nums:
                if cur + x > limit:
                    count += 1
                    cur = x
                else:
                    cur += x
            return count

        left, right = max(nums), sum(nums)
        answer = right
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if needed(mid) <= k:
                answer = mid
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return answer
```

### C++ (GNU++17)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Count how many subarrays are needed if each subarray sum <= limit
    int subarraysNeeded(const vector<int>& nums, int limit) {
        int count = 1, cur = 0;
        for (int x : nums) {
            if (cur + x > limit) {
                ++count;          // start a new subarray
                cur = x;
            } else {
                cur += x;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    int splitArray(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        long long left = 0, right = 0;
        for (int x : nums) {
            left = max<long long>(left, x);
            right += x;
        }

        int answer = static_cast<int>(right);
        while (left <= right) {
            long long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (subarraysNeeded(nums, static_cast<int>(mid)) <= k) {
                answer = static_cast<int>(mid);
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
};
```

> **Tip:** In C++ you can safely store the bounds in `long long` because `sum(nums)` can reach `10⁹` – still inside `int`, but the long type guarantees no overflow in intermediate calculations.
