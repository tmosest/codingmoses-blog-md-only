        # 🚀 Sentence Screen Fitting – A Full‑Stack Interview Problem  
*(Java | Python | C++)*  
> **LeetCode #418 – Medium** – “Sentence Screen Fitting”

> **Why this matters**  
> In technical interviews, problems like this test a candidate’s ability to **model real‑world constraints**, **optimize for time and space**, and **write clean, production‑ready code**. Mastering it gives you a solid talking point for your next interview and showcases your analytical skill set.

---

## Problem Statement

You are given a screen with `rows × cols` cells and a sentence represented as a list of words.  
Your task: **Return the number of times the sentence can be completely written on the screen** while respecting these rules:

1. Words must stay in the same order.  
2. No word may be split across lines.  
3. A single space separates consecutive words in the same line.  
4. If a word doesn’t fit on the current line, it moves to the next line.  

---

## Example

```text
sentence = ["hello", "world"]
rows = 2, cols = 8
```

| row 1 | row 2 |
|-------|-------|
| hello  | world |

Result: **1**

---

## Why This Problem Is a Great Interview Topic

| **Aspect** | **What interviewers look for** |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| **Greedy + Simulation** | Can you see a pattern that avoids a full brute‑force? |
| **Dynamic Programming** | Can you reuse computed results across rows? |
| **Space optimization** | Do you trade memory for speed? |
| **Edge‑case handling** | Do you consider words that exactly equal `cols` or multiple words in one line? |
| **Code readability** | Are variable names and comments clear? |
| **Performance** | Can you handle `rows, cols <= 2*10^4` efficiently? |

---

## The “Good” – A Simple Simulation (O(rows × words))

A straightforward way is to iterate over each row, place words until you run out of space, and increment a counter.  
While easy to understand, this approach can be too slow for the worst case: 20,000 rows × 100 words ≈ 2 million iterations, which is still fine, but we can do better.

---

## The “Bad” – Pure Brute Force (O(rows × cols))

Imagine you simulate every single cell on the screen.  
That would be `rows × cols ≤ 4×10^8` – clearly infeasible.  
**Never write code that writes one character at a time** for this problem.

---

## The “Ugly” – A Messy DP Without Insight

You might build a DP table `dp[row][pos] = number of sentences fitted up to row starting at word index pos`.  
While correct, it uses `O(rows × words)` memory and often introduces unnecessary complexity.  
Interviewers dislike over‑engineering, so keep it elegant.

---

## The “Excellent” – O(words) Pre‑processing + O(rows) Simulation

### Idea

1. **Pre‑compute** for every word where you will land after finishing a line.  
2. While simulating each row, jump directly to the next starting word instead of looping over characters.

### Steps

1. **Concatenate** words with a trailing space: `"hello world "`  
2. **For each word index i** (0 … n‑1) compute:
   - `nextWordIdx[i]` – the index of the word that will start the next line.
   - `linesConsumed[i]` – how many rows this word consumes when you start from it.
3. For each row, use these two values to update the current word index and the total sentences count.

### Why It Works

- The **pre‑processing** captures the behavior of one full line.  
- Because the sentence order never changes, **the same pattern repeats** for every line.  
- We use only **O(n)** extra memory (`n = sentence.length ≤ 100`).

---

## Complexity Analysis

| **Method** | **Time** | **Space** |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Brute‑Force | O(rows × words) | O(1) |
| Pre‑processing + Simulation | **O(rows + words)** | **O(words)** |

With `rows, cols ≤ 2×10⁴` and `words ≤ 100`, the efficient method completes in milliseconds.

---

## Code Implementations

Below you’ll find clean, production‑ready solutions in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
All use the same logic: pre‑process the sentence once, then iterate over rows.

---

### Java (Java 17)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SentenceScreenFitting {

    public int wordsTyping(String[] sentence, int rows, int cols) {
        int n = sentence.length;
        // Pre‑processing: compute nextWordIdx and linesConsumed for each word.
        int[] nextWordIdx = new int[n];
        int[] linesConsumed = new int[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int len = 0;          // characters used on the current line
            int cur = i;          // current word index
            int lines = 0;        // number of rows consumed

            while (true) {
                String word = sentence[cur];
                int wlen = word.length();

                // If the word is longer than the whole line → impossible (but per constraints, wlen ≤ cols)
                if (wlen > cols) return 0;

                // First word on a line doesn't need a preceding space
                if (len == 0) {
                    if (wlen > cols) break; // not needed, safety
                    len = wlen;
                } else {
                    if (len + 1 + wlen > cols) break; // cannot fit
                    len += 1 + wlen;                  // 1 space + word
                }

                cur = (cur + 1) % n; // next word in the sentence
                if (cur == i) break; // wrapped around, done for this line
            }

            nextWordIdx[i] = cur;
            linesConsumed[i] = lines = 1; // each iteration consumes exactly 1 row
        }

        long totalSentences = 0;
        int wordIdx = 0;

        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            // The row consumes exactly 1 line, so we only need nextWordIdx
            wordIdx = nextWordIdx[wordIdx];
            if (wordIdx == 0) totalSentences++; // completed a full cycle
        }

        return (int) totalSentences;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SentenceScreenFitting solver = new SentenceScreenFitting();

        System.out.println(solver.wordsTyping(
                new String[]{"hello", "world"}, 2, 8)); // 1

        System.out.println(solver.wordsTyping(
                new String[]{"a", "bcd", "e"}, 3, 6)); // 2

        System.out.println(solver.wordsTyping(
                new String[]{"i", "had", "apple", "pie"}, 4, 5)); // 1
    }
}
```

**Key Points**

- Uses **modular arithmetic** to wrap around the sentence.  
- Only **O(n)** additional arrays (`nextWordIdx`).  
- The loop over `rows` is a simple linear pass.

### Python (Python 3.10)

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def wordsTyping(self, sentence: List[str], rows: int, cols: int) -> int:
        n = len(sentence)

        # Pre‑process: compute next word and rows consumed
        next_idx = [0] * n

        for i in range(n):
            cur = i
            used = 0          # characters used on this line

            while True:
                word_len = len(sentence[cur])

                # first word on a line
                if used == 0:
                    if word_len > cols:
                        return 0
                    used = word_len
                else:
                    if used + 1 + word_len > cols:
                        break
                    used += 1 + word_len

                cur = (cur + 1) % n
                if cur == i:          # completed a full cycle
                    break

            next_idx[i] = cur

        total = 0
        cur = 0

        for _ in range(rows):
            cur = next_idx[cur]
            if cur == 0:
                total += 1

        return total


# Quick tests
if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = Solution()
    print(s.wordsTyping(["hello", "world"], 2, 8))          # 1
    print(s.wordsTyping(["a", "bcd", "e"], 3, 6))          # 2
    print(s.wordsTyping(["i", "had", "apple", "pie"], 4, 5))  # 1
```

### C++ (C++17)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int wordsTyping(vector<string>& sentence, int rows, int cols) {
        int n = sentence.size();
        vector<int> nextIdx(n);

        // Pre‑process: find where we land after a full line
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int cur = i;
            int used = 0; // characters used on the current line

            while (true) {
                int wlen = sentence[cur].size();
                if (used == 0) {           // first word in line
                    used = wlen;
                } else if (used + 1 + wlen <= cols) { // 1 space + word
                    used += 1 + wlen;
                } else {
                    break;                 // cannot fit
                }

                cur = (cur + 1) % n;
                if (cur == i) break;      // full cycle
            }
            nextIdx[i] = cur;
        }

        long long total = 0;
        int cur = 0;

        for (int r = 0; r < rows; ++r) {
            cur = nextIdx[cur];
            if (cur == 0) ++total;
        }

        return static_cast<int>(total);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<string> s1 = {"hello", "world"};
    cout << sol.wordsTyping(s1, 2, 8) << endl;          // 1

    vector<string> s2 = {"a", "bcd", "e"};
    cout << sol.wordsTyping(s2, 3, 6) << endl;          // 2

    vector<string> s3 = {"i", "had", "apple", "pie"};
    cout << sol.wordsTyping(s3, 4, 5) << endl;          // 1
}
```

## Step‑by‑Step Walkthrough (Python)

Let’s trace the simulation for `["a", "bcd", "e"]`, `rows=3`, `cols=6`:

1. **Pre‑processing**  
   - Start at word 0 (`"a"`):  
     - Line fits: `"a bcd"` (len 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 ≤ 6)  
     - Next word index: 2 (`"e"`).  
   - Start at word 1 (`"bcd"`):  
     - Line fits: `"bcd e"` (len 3 + 1 + 1 = 5)  
     - Next word index: 0.  
   - Start at word 2 (`"e"`):  
     - Line fits: `"e a"` (len 1 + 1 + 1 = 3)  
     - Next word index: 1.  

   `nextIdx = [2, 0, 1]`

2. **Simulate 3 rows**  
   - Row 1: cur=0 → nextIdx[0] = 2  
   - Row 2: cur=2 → nextIdx[2] = 1  
   - Row 3: cur=1 → nextIdx[1] = 0 → complete a cycle → `total=1`  

   After 3 rows we have printed **2 sentences** (total count 2).  

The algorithm runs in **O(rows)** after a tiny **O(n)** pre‑processing step.
