## 1. Problem Recap  

| ‚úÖ | ‚úîÔ∏è |
|---|---|
| **LeetCode #418** | *Medium* |
| **Signature** | `public int wordsTyping(String[] sentence, int rows, int cols)` (Java)<br>`int wordsTyping(vector<string>& sentence, int rows, int cols)` (C++)<br>`def wordsTyping(sentence: List[str], rows: int, cols: int) -> int` (Python) |
| **Goal** | Count how many full times the sentence can be fitted onto an `rows √ó cols` screen. |
| **Rules** | ‚Ä¢ Words must keep original order.<br>‚Ä¢ No word can be split across lines.<br>‚Ä¢ A single space separates two consecutive words. |

## 2. Why Is This Problem Worth Studying?  

- **Real‚Äëworld vibe**: It‚Äôs essentially a ‚Äúword‚Äëwrapping‚Äù problem you‚Äôll see in UI layout, text editors, and printing engines.  
- **Interview favorite**: LeetCode‚Äôs 418 is a go‚Äëto ‚Äúmedium‚Äù question for front‚Äëend, back‚Äëend, and systems roles.  
- **Multiple solution patterns**: Na√Øve simulation, greedy with caching, and even dynamic programming.  
- **Time complexity insight**: Learn how to turn an **O(rows‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØwords)** routine into **O(rows + sentence length)**.  

---

## 3. The Na√Øve Approach (O(rows‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØsentence length))

```text
for each row
    curCol = 0
    while curCol + len(word) <= cols
        place word, curCol += len(word) + 1
        advance to next word (wrap at end)
```

**Pros**  
- Easy to implement and understand.  

**Cons**  
- Worst‚Äëcase time can be huge (rows = 2‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚Å¥, words = 100).  
- Does not reuse information between rows.

---

## 4. The Optimized Greedy + Caching Approach (O(rows + sentence length))

The key insight: **After a row ends, the next row always starts at the same word index** that the previous row finished with.  

1. **Pre‚Äëcompute the ‚Äúnext word index‚Äù for every starting word.**  
   *Simulate placing words until you exceed `cols`.*  
   This is done only once for each word (max 100).  
2. **Simulate row by row using the cache.**  
   *Start from word 0, repeatedly jump using the cache, increment a counter each time we return to word 0.*  

Because each word index is processed at most once per row, the total work is **O(rows + sentence length)**.

## 5. Corner Cases to Watch

| Case | What Happens? | Why It Matters |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Word longer than `cols` | Impossible, but constraints forbid it. | Still good to guard in code. |
| `rows` or `cols` = 1 | Minimum screen size ‚Äì algorithm still works. | Handles tight memory limits. |
| Sentence length = 1 | Only one word repeats. | Cache table has only one entry. |
| Large `rows` (20‚ÄØ000) | Performance critical. | Our greedy solution stays fast. |

## 6. Code Implementations

### 6.1 Java (O(rows + sentence length))

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int wordsTyping(String[] sentence, int rows, int cols) {
        int n = sentence.length;
        int[] nextWord = new int[n];
        int[] wordsCount = new int[n];   // how many sentences start from word i

        // Pre‚Äëcompute nextWord and wordsCount for each start index
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int col = 0;          // current column position
            int cnt = 0;          // how many full sentences fit
            int idx = i;          // current word index

            while (col + sentence[idx].length() <= cols) {
                col += sentence[idx].length() + 1;   // word + space
                idx = (idx + 1) % n;
                if (idx == 0) cnt++;                 // finished a sentence
            }
            nextWord[i] = idx;
            wordsCount[i] = cnt;
        }

        // Simulate rows
        int wordIndex = 0;
        int totalSentences = 0;
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            totalSentences += wordsCount[wordIndex];
            wordIndex = nextWord[wordIndex];
        }
        return totalSentences;
    }
}
```

### 6.2 Python (O(rows + sentence length))

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def wordsTyping(self, sentence: List[str], rows: int, cols: int) -> int:
        n = len(sentence)
        next_word = [0] * n
        sentences_per_row = [0] * n

        # Pre‚Äëcompute for each start word
        for i in range(n):
            col = 0
            cnt = 0
            idx = i
            while col + len(sentence[idx]) <= cols:
                col += len(sentence[idx]) + 1  # word + space
                idx = (idx + 1) % n
                if idx == 0:
                    cnt += 1
            next_word[i] = idx
            sentences_per_row[i] = cnt

        # Simulate rows
        word_idx = 0
        total = 0
        for _ in range(rows):
            total += sentences_per_row[word_idx]
            word_idx = next_word[word_idx]

        return total
```

### 6.3 C++ (O(rows + sentence length))

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int wordsTyping(std::vector<std::string>& sentence, int rows, int cols) {
        int n = sentence.size();
        std::vector<int> nextWord(n), cntPerRow(n);

        // Pre‚Äëcompute
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int col = 0, cnt = 0, idx = i;
            while (col + sentence[idx].size() <= cols) {
                col += sentence[idx].size() + 1; // word + space
                idx = (idx + 1) % n;
                if (idx == 0) ++cnt;
            }
            nextWord[i] = idx;
            cntPerRow[i] = cnt;
        }

        // Simulate rows
        int wordIdx = 0, total = 0;
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; ++r) {
            total += cntPerRow[wordIdx];
            wordIdx = nextWord[wordIdx];
        }
        return total;
    }
};
```

> **Tip**: In production code, guard against words longer than `cols`.  
> **Testing**: Run the three provided examples and add edge‚Äëcase tests.

## 7. ‚ÄúGood, Bad, & Ugly‚Äù of the Optimized Solution  

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Time Complexity** | `O(rows + sentence length)` ‚Üí fast even for 20‚ÄØk rows | Still linear in `rows`; cannot be sub‚Äëlinear | None (fast enough for constraints) |
| **Space Complexity** | `O(sentence length)` for cache | Requires two arrays of size `n` | None |
| **Readability** | Clear separation: *pre‚Äëcomputation* + *simulation* | Cache logic may be a bit opaque to newcomers | If you skip the cache, you‚Äôll write an O(rows‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØn) loop‚Äîhard to spot inefficiency |
| **Edge‚Äëcase handling** | Handles wrap‚Äëaround elegantly | Must be careful with `idx = (idx + 1) % n` | None |
| **Reusability** | Cache can be reused for multiple test cases on same sentence | Cache invalidates if sentence changes | None |

## 8. Interview‚ÄëReady Tips

1. **Explain the observation**: ‚ÄúAfter a row, we always know which word the next row starts with.‚Äù  
2. **Show the DP / cache idea**: ‚ÄúWe pre‚Äëcompute next word and sentence count for each start word.‚Äù  
3. **Complexity trade‚Äëoff**: ‚ÄúWe only simulate `rows` once; pre‚Äëcomputation is cheap (‚â§ 100 words).‚Äù  
4. **Edge case talk**: ‚ÄúIf a word‚Äôs length > cols, we return 0 (though constraints forbid it).‚Äù  
5. **Discuss alternatives**: ‚ÄúWe could also simulate row by row directly, but that would be O(rows‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØn).‚Äù

## 9. Testing Checklist

| Test | Description | Expected Output |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Example 1 | `["hello","world"]`, rows=2, cols=8 | 1 |
| Example 2 | `["a","bcd","e"]`, rows=3, cols=6 | 2 |
| Example 3 | `["i","had","apple","pie"]`, rows=4, cols=5 | 1 |
| Single word | `["a"]`, rows=10, cols=1 | 10 |
| Max rows | 20‚ÄØ000 rows, 100 words of length 1, cols=10 | 200‚ÄØ000 (if words fit exactly) |
| Long word | `["longword"]`, rows=3, cols=10 | 0 (if length > cols, otherwise 3) |

Run each implementation against this suite to guarantee correctness.

## 10. Closing Thoughts

- **Why you should master this**: It blends greedy logic with caching‚Äîa pattern that appears in many interview problems (e.g., *Text Justification*, *Largest Rectangle in Histogram*).  
- **Career angle**: Demonstrating the ability to turn an `O(n*m)` solution into `O(n+m)` shows *algorithmic maturity*‚Äîexactly what hiring managers look for.  
- **Next steps**: Try implementing a **dynamic programming** variant that stores the exact number of words placed per row; or explore **bit‚Äëmask** optimization for extreme constraints.
