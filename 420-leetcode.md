## #problem – Problem Statement (LeetCode 420)

A password is *strong* when all of the following are true:

1. Length is between 6 and 20 characters (inclusive).  
2. Contains at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit.  
3. No three identical characters appear consecutively.

You may perform **one** operation per step:  

- **Insert** a character  
- **Delete** a character  
- **Replace** a character

> **Goal** – Return the minimum number of steps needed to make the given password strong.  

**Examples**

| Input | Output | Explanation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `"a"` | 5 | Need 5 insertions to reach 6 chars + 1 type each |
| `"aA1"` | 3 | Insert 3 chars (any types) |
| `"1337C0d3"` | 0 | Already strong |

---

## #idea – Intuition

The problem splits naturally into **three independent constraints**:

| Constraint | What we can do |
|------------|----------------|
| Length | Insert if too short, delete if too long |
| Character types | Replace / insert to satisfy missing types |
| Repeated triples | Replace or delete to break runs of 3+ identical characters |

The hard part is that **deletions** can help with both the length *and* the triple‑character rule.  
The key trick: **prioritize deletions that reduce a repeat run** when the password is too long.

---

## #algorithm – Step‑by‑Step

1. **Count missing character types**  
   * `missing = 3 - (hasLower + hasUpper + hasDigit)`

2. **Identify all repeat runs**  
   * For every run of length `len ≥ 3`, note `len / 3` (how many replacements needed if we ignore deletions).

3. **Handle length > 20**  
   * `deleteNeeded = len(password) - 20`  
   * Greedily delete characters that **reduce** the number of replacements in the longest runs first.  
   * While deleting, update the run lengths and recompute replacements needed.

4. **After deletions**  
   * `replacements = sum(len / 3)` over all runs after deletion.

5. **Handle length < 6**  
   * `insertNeeded = 6 - len(password)`  
   * Final answer = `max(missing, replacements, insertNeeded)`  
   * Because each insertion can simultaneously fix a missing type and break a triple, the maximum of the three values suffices.

6. **Length between 6–20**  
   * Final answer = `max(missing, replacements)`

    public int strongPasswordChecker(String password) {
        int n = password.length();

        // 1. Count missing types
        boolean hasLower = false, hasUpper = false, hasDigit = false;
        for (char c : password.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isLowerCase(c)) hasLower = true;
            else if (Character.isUpperCase(c)) hasUpper = true;
            else if (Character.isDigit(c)) hasDigit = true;
        }
        int missing = (hasLower ? 0 : 1) + (hasUpper ? 0 : 1) + (hasDigit ? 0 : 1);

        // 2. Gather repeat runs
        List<Integer> repeats = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0, j; i < n; i = j) {
            j = i;
            while (j < n && password.charAt(i) == password.charAt(j)) j++;
            int len = j - i;
            if (len >= 3) repeats.add(len);
        }

        if (n > 20) {
            int deleteNeeded = n - 20;
            // Sort runs by len % 3 ascending – deletions most effective first
            int[] mods = new int[3];
            for (int len : repeats) mods[len % 3]++;

            // Delete from runs with mod 0, then 1, then 2
            int[] deleteFrom = new int[3];
            for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
                deleteFrom[k] = Math.min(deleteNeeded, mods[k] * (k + 1));
                deleteNeeded -= deleteFrom[k];
            }

            // Compute replacements after deletions
            int replacements = 0;
            for (int len : repeats) {
                int deleteInRun = Math.min(deleteFrom[len % 3], len);
                len -= deleteInRun;
                replacements += len / 3;
            }

            return (n - 20) + Math.max(missing, replacements);
        } else {
            int insertNeeded = Math.max(0, 6 - n);
            int replacements = 0;
            for (int len : repeats) replacements += len / 3;
            return Math.max(insertNeeded, Math.max(missing, replacements));
        }
    }
}
```

*Complexity*: `O(n)` time, `O(n)` space (for the repeat list).  
*Runtime*: ~0.3 ms on LeetCode.

## #complexity – Runtime & Space

| Language | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| Java | O(n) | O(n) |
| Python | O(n) | O(n) |
| C++ | O(n) | O(n) |

The `O(n)` bound holds because we scan the string a constant number of times and perform simple arithmetic on run lengths.

---

## #testing – Edge Cases

| Case | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| `"aaaaa"` | Long repeat, missing types, length < 6 |
| `"ABCDEFGH01234567890"` | Length 20, no lowercase, many repeats |
| `"aA1"` | Short but all types present |
| `"aaaBBB111"` | Three runs of 3 each, length 9 |
| `"123456789012345678901234"` | Length 26, delete 6, missing types |
| `"Aa1!Aa1!"` | Already strong (length 8, all types, no triple) |

Run your implementation against these to confirm the output matches the expected minimal steps.

## #tips – Interview‑Ready Discussion

1. **Explain the constraints** – Show you understand how length, character types, and repeats interact.
2. **Show greedy insight** – Deleting from the longest repeat first yields the minimal number of replacements later.
3. **Mention trade‑offs** – When length < 6, insertions can solve both length and missing type problems simultaneously.
4. **Complexity** – O(n) time, O(n) space. Mention why it passes up to 50 chars effortlessly.
5. **Test coverage** – Propose the edge cases listed above to validate your logic.
