### 1️⃣  Problem Recap

A password is *strong* if it satisfies all of the following:

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Length | 6 ≤ len ≤ 20 |
| Character Types | At least one lowercase, one uppercase, one digit |
| Repeats | No three identical characters in a row (e.g., “aaa” is forbidden) |

You may **insert**, **delete**, or **replace** a character in one step.  
Goal: **Minimum number of steps** to transform a given password into a strong one.

---

### 2️⃣  High‑Level Strategy

| Situation | What we do | Why |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| `len < 6` | Insert or replace | Need more characters; replacements can also fix missing types |
| `6 ≤ len ≤ 20` | Replace | Only replacements are required |
| `len > 20` | Delete + Replace | Must shorten the string; deletions can reduce needed replacements |

Key insight: **Deleting the right characters in long passwords also helps fix the “three‑in‑a‑row” rule**.  
We handle the repeats by grouping runs of identical characters and counting how many replacements each run would need (`floor(len/3)`).  
Then we strategically delete from those runs to lower the replacement count before we finish.

---

### 3️⃣  Detailed Algorithm

1. **Count missing character types**  
   - `missing = 3 – (hasLower + hasUpper + hasDigit)`

2. **Identify all runs of identical characters**  
   - For each run of length `L`, record `L`.  
   - Replacement needed for this run: `rep += L / 3`.

3. **Three cases based on current length**

| `len` | Steps |
|-------|-------|
| `< 6` | `max(missing, 6 – len)` |
| `6 ≤ len ≤ 20` | `max(missing, rep)` |
| `> 20` |  
   *Delete* `del = len – 20` characters.  
   Use deletions to reduce `rep`:

   - Delete from runs where `L % 3 == 0` first (each deletion saves 1 replacement).  
   - Then from runs where `L % 3 == 1` (each 2 deletions save 1 replacement).  
   - Finally from runs where `L % 3 == 2` (each 3 deletions save 1 replacement).  

   After all deletions, recompute `rep` as `sum(L / 3)` for the shortened runs.  
   **Total steps** = `del + max(missing, rep)`.

Complexity: **O(n)** time, **O(1)** auxiliary space (besides the run list which is at most `n/3` long).

### 📜 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int strongPasswordChecker(String password) {
        int n = password.length();
        boolean lower = false, upper = false, digit = false;
        for (char c : password.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isLowerCase(c)) lower = true;
            else if (Character.isUpperCase(c)) upper = true;
            else if (Character.isDigit(c)) digit = true;
        }
        int missing = 3 - (lower ? 1 : 0) - (upper ? 1 : 0) - (digit ? 1 : 0);

        List<Integer> runs = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n;) {
            int j = i;
            while (j < n && password.charAt(j) == password.charAt(i)) j++;
            runs.add(j - i);
            i = j;
        }

        int replace = 0;
        for (int len : runs) replace += len / 3;

        if (n < 6) {
            return Math.max(missing, 6 - n);
        } else if (n <= 20) {
            return Math.max(missing, replace);
        } else {
            int delete = n - 20;
            // Use deletions to reduce replacements
            int[] mods = new int[3];
            for (int len : runs) mods[len % 3]++;

            // delete from len%3==0 first
            int d = Math.min(delete, mods[0]);
            replace -= d;
            delete -= d;

            // delete from len%3==1 next
            d = Math.min(delete, mods[1] * 2);
            replace -= d / 2;
            delete -= d;

            // delete from len%3==2 next
            d = Math.min(delete, mods[2] * 3);
            replace -= d / 3;
            delete -= d;

            return (n - 20) + Math.max(missing, replace);
        }
    }
}
```

### 📜 Python 3

```python
class Solution:
    def strongPasswordChecker(self, password: str) -> int:
        n = len(password)
        lower = any(c.islower() for c in password)
        upper = any(c.isupper() for c in password)
        digit = any(c.isdigit() for c in password)
        missing = 3 - (lower + upper + digit)

        # runs of identical chars
        runs = []
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            j = i
            while j < n and password[j] == password[i]:
                j += 1
            runs.append(j - i)
            i = j

        replace = sum(l // 3 for l in runs)

        if n < 6:
            return max(missing, 6 - n)
        if n <= 20:
            return max(missing, replace)

        delete = n - 20
        # priority: mod 0, then 1, then 2
        mods = [0, 0, 0]
        for l in runs:
            mods[l % 3] += 1

        d = min(delete, mods[0])
        replace -= d
        delete -= d

        d = min(delete, mods[1] * 2)
        replace -= d // 2
        delete -= d

        d = min(delete, mods[2] * 3)
        replace -= d // 3
        delete -= d

        return (n - 20) + max(missing, replace)
```

### 📜 C++ (GNU++17)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int strongPasswordChecker(string password) {
        int n = password.size();
        bool hasLow = false, hasUp = false, hasDig = false;
        for (char c : password) {
            if (islower(c)) hasLow = true;
            else if (isupper(c)) hasUp = true;
            else if (isdigit(c)) hasDig = true;
        }

> **Meta Description:** Learn the complete solution, pitfalls, and interview strategies for LeetCode 420. Get Java, Python, C++ code and interview‑ready insights.

---

### Introduction  

When you see *Strong Password Checker* on LeetCode, you instantly know it’s not just about string length.  
It’s a “Hard” problem that tests:

1. **Greedy optimization** (minimizing steps while deleting and replacing).  
2. **Edge‑case handling** (very short, very long passwords, runs of same char).  
3. **Space–time trade‑offs** (keeping the algorithm linear).  

For recruiters, solving this puzzle demonstrates mastery of:

- **Dynamic programming style reasoning** (though we use greedy, the thought process is similar).  
- **Complexity analysis** – O(n) time is a must.  
- **Problem‑decomposition** – Breaking the problem into *missing types*, *length constraints*, *repeat constraints*.

---

### The Good – Why It’s Beautiful

| Aspect | Why it’s good |
|--------|---------------|
| **Clear sub‑problems** | Missing types, length, repeats – each solvable independently. |
| **Greedy optimality** | Deleting strategically from runs (`%3 == 0` first) guarantees the minimal number of replacements. |
| **Linear time** | Even with nested loops for runs, we scan the string only once. |
| **Compact code** | All three implementations fit under 120 lines, a real interview‑friendly size. |

### The Bad – Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | How to avoid it |
|---------|-----------------|
| Forgetting to **count missing character types** | Always compute `missing` first. |
| Mishandling **short passwords** | For `len < 6`, you must consider that each insertion can simultaneously satisfy a missing type. |
| Over‑deleting **in long passwords** | Deleting more than `len-20` is useless; focus deletions on runs to reduce replacements. |
| **Off‑by‑one errors** when computing `replace` (`len/3`) | Use integer division carefully; test with edge cases like “aaa” and “aaaaaa”. |
| **Mis‑ordering deletions** | Prioritize runs where `len % 3 == 0`, then `1`, then `2`. |

### The Ugly – When Things Break

> *“What if I delete in the wrong order and my solution takes 100 ms or crashes?”*

- **Time limit issues**: O(n) is fast enough, but poorly implemented deletions can blow up if you simulate deletions character‑by‑character.  
- **Memory blow‑up**: Storing the entire string repeatedly or building new strings for each deletion will kill performance.  
- **Edge case “!!!111aaa”**: You need at least one lower case and one upper case – the run logic alone won’t fix this without the missing‑type check.

The fix? Stick to **pre‑computed run lengths** and apply deletions mathematically instead of literally removing characters.  

---

### How to Ace LeetCode 420 in an Interview

1. **Explain the breakdown**: Talk through *missing types*, *length constraints*, and *repeats*.  
2. **Draw a quick diagram** of a long password and mark where deletions save a replacement.  
3. **Write pseudo‑code** before coding – it shows you’re thinking logically.  
4. **Mention complexity**: “I can scan in O(n) and only need constant additional space.”  
5. **Test on the fly**: Try “aA1”, “aaaaaa”, “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA”.  
6. **Optional trick**: If you’re tight on time, you can skip rebuilding the run list after deletions and just adjust counts – the maths still works.

---

### Takeaway  

LeetCode 420 isn’t just a hard problem; it’s a *signature* problem.  
A clean solution, awareness of pitfalls, and a concise implementation signal to hiring managers that you:

- Understand **algorithmic patterns** (greedy, dynamic, etc.).  
- Can **communicate complex logic** in plain English.  
- Are ready for **real‑world systems** where constraints (memory, speed, data integrity) matter.

---

### Conclusion  

With the code snippets above, you can now:

- Submit instantly on LeetCode.  
- Discuss the problem with confidence in an interview.  
- Showcase how to turn a seemingly complicated password policy into a neat, linear solution.
