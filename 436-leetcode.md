## üìå Problem Statement

> **Find Right Interval**  
> You are given an array of intervals, where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]` and each `start_i` is unique.  
> For every interval `i` find the interval `j` whose start is **‚â•** `end_i` and whose start is minimal.  
> Return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the index of that right interval, or `-1` if none exists.

**Examples**

| Input | Output | Explanation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `[[1,2]]` | `[-1]` | Only one interval ‚Üí no right interval |
| `[[3,4],[2,3],[1,2]]` | `[-1,0,1]` | The interval `[2,3]` (index 1) has `[3,4]` (index 0) as the minimal right interval. |
| `[[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]` | `[-1,2,-1]` | Only `[2,3]` (index 1) has `[3,4]` (index 2) as its right interval. |

**Constraints**

- `1 ‚â§ intervals.length ‚â§ 2 * 10‚Å¥`
- `-10‚Å∂ ‚â§ start_i ‚â§ end_i ‚â§ 10‚Å∂`
- All `start_i` are distinct.

## üîß Solution Idea

The classic way to solve this problem is to:

1. **Record each interval‚Äôs start together with its original index.**  
   Example: `[(start, index), ‚Ä¶]`.

2. **Sort the list by start values.**  
   After sorting, a binary search on the sorted starts gives the *smallest start that is ‚â• a given end*.

3. **For each original interval**  
   - Binary search the sorted list for `end_i`.  
   - If found, return the stored original index; otherwise return `-1`.

The overall complexity is dominated by the sort: `O(n log n)`.  
The binary searches are `O(log n)` each, for a total of `O(n log n)`.

This approach is succinct, uses only standard library containers, and works for all given constraints.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code ‚Äì Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] findRightInterval(int[][] intervals) {
        int n = intervals.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        // 1. Pair start with original index
        int[][] starts = new int[n][2];          // [start, index]
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            starts[i][0] = intervals[i][0];
            starts[i][1] = i;
        }

        // 2. Sort by start
        Arrays.sort(starts, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));

        // 3. For each interval, binary search for its right interval
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int end = intervals[i][1];
            int idx = binarySearch(starts, end);
            result[i] = idx;            // idx is -1 if not found
        }
        return result;
    }

    /** Binary search on sorted starts to find minimal start >= target. */
    private int binarySearch(int[][] starts, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = starts.length - 1;
        int answer = -1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (starts[mid][0] >= target) {
                answer = starts[mid][1];   // store original index
                right = mid - 1;           // keep searching left part
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```

from bisect import bisect_left
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findRightInterval(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(intervals)

        starts = [(intervals[i][0], i) for i in range(n)]
        starts.sort()                      # sort by start

## üìö Good, Bad & Ugly

| Aspect | What Worked | What Didn‚Äôt Work | Improvements |
|--------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Good** | ‚Ä¢ Using a sorted list of starts + binary search gives optimal `O(n log n)` performance.<br>‚Ä¢ Clear separation of concerns: build data structure ‚Üí query. | | |
| **Bad** | ‚Ä¢ Some solutions use an unordered map to store start‚Üíindex, but then use a priority queue or two heaps; that‚Äôs unnecessary complexity for this problem. | | Avoid extra data structures unless required. |
| **Ugly** | ‚Ä¢ Implementing a custom binary search by hand and missing the edge case `start >= end` can lead to off‚Äëby‚Äëone bugs.<br>‚Ä¢ Forgetting that `start` values are unique allows you to avoid ties but you must still handle negative numbers correctly. | ‚Ä¢ Use library functions (`bisect`, `lower_bound`) to prevent such bugs.<br>‚Ä¢ Always test on edge cases: one interval, all overlapping, no overlaps. | |

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Using `> end` instead of `>= end`** ‚Äì the problem explicitly requires `start >= end`.  
2. **Assuming `start` values are sorted** ‚Äì they are unique but not sorted in the input.  
3. **Not handling negative numbers** ‚Äì the range is `-10‚Å∂` to `10‚Å∂`.  
4. **Time‚Äëlimit exceed** ‚Äì sorting `O(n log n)` is fine, but nested loops (`O(n¬≤)`) will fail for `n = 20,000`.

## üíº Interview Takeaways

| Topic | How to discuss it |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Problem restatement** | ‚ÄúGiven intervals with unique starts, for each find the smallest starting interval that begins at or after its end.‚Äù |
| **Edge cases** | ‚ÄúI‚Äôll check single‚Äëinterval, fully overlapping, and disjoint scenarios.‚Äù |
| **Algorithm** | ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pair each start with its original index, sort the pairs, and binary‚Äësearch for each end value.‚Äù |
| **Complexity** | ‚ÄúSorting takes `O(n log n)`, and each binary search is `O(log n)`, giving overall `O(n log n)`.‚Äù |
| **Alternative** | ‚ÄúA hash map plus two‚Äëheap solution exists but is overkill; the sorted list approach is simplest and fastest.‚Äù |
| **Code structure** | ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep the algorithm concise, use built‚Äëin binary search, and document each step.‚Äù |

> **Tip:** When explaining your solution, walk through a small example on paper or a whiteboard. This demonstrates clarity and helps interviewers see you‚Äôre thinking through edge cases.
