        ## 1.  Problem Recap – LeetCode 439 “Ternary Expression Parser”

| Name | LeetCode ID | Difficulty | Tags |
|------|------------|------------|------|
| Ternary Expression Parser | 439 | Medium | String, Stack, Recursion |

**Input** – A string `expression` that contains only digits `0–9`, the letters `T` (true) and `F` (false), and the ternary delimiters `?` and `:`.  
**Guarantee** – `expression` is syntactically correct and each digit is a single‑character number.  
**Output** – The value of the expression: a single character that is either a digit, `T` or `F`.

The ternary operator groups **right‑to‑left**:

```
T?2:3          →  (T?2:3)          →  2
F?1:T?4:5      →  (F?1:(T?4:5))   →  4
T?T?F:5:3      →  (T?(T?F:5):3)   →  F
```

The classic way to evaluate it is to process the expression from the **rightmost** end and keep a stack of the “results” of sub‑expressions.

---

## 2.  Algorithm Overview

1. **Start at the rightmost character** – this is guaranteed to be a “value” (`0‑9`, `T`, or `F`).
2. **Scan leftwards**.  
   * Whenever we see a `?`, the character to its **right** is the *true* branch and the character two positions to the right (after skipping the `:`) is the *false* branch.  
   * Pick the branch based on the character that **immediately precedes** the `?`.
3. **Repeat** until we have processed the whole string – the last remaining character is the final answer.

The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** auxiliary space (no real stack is needed – we only keep the current position).

Below you’ll find clean, idiomatic implementations in **Java**, **Python** and **C++**.

## 3.  Code Solutions

> **Tip for Interviews** – explain the right‑to‑left property before diving into code; it shows you understand the semantics of the ternary operator.

---

### 3.1  Java – Iterative, Right‑to‑Left

```java
public class Solution {
    public String parseTernary(String expression) {
        int i = expression.length() - 1;          // start at last char
        char result = expression.charAt(i);       // current result
        i--;                                      // move left to the preceding char

        while (i >= 0) {
            if (expression.charAt(i) == '?') {
                // The value before '?' decides which branch to keep
                if (expression.charAt(i - 1) == 'T') {
                    // keep the true branch: character after '?'
                    result = expression.charAt(i + 1);
                } else {
                    // keep the false branch: skip over ':' and the value after it
                    result = expression.charAt(i + 3);
                }
                i -= 2;  // skip over the '?' and the chosen branch
            } else {
                i--;     // skip ordinary characters
            }
        }
        return String.valueOf(result);
    }
}
```

**Why it works** – By walking from the right, we always know the *value* that follows a `?`. The character *before* that `?` tells us which side to take. Because we process inner expressions first, the outer ternary operators are evaluated correctly.

---

### 3.2  Python – Recursion (Elegant but O(n) space)

```python
class Solution:
    def parseTernary(self, expression: str) -> str:
        def helper(i: int) -> (str, int):
            # Return the value at position i and the index of the next token
            if expression[i].isdigit() or expression[i] in 'TF':
                return expression[i], i

            # expression[i] == '?'
            true_val, next_i = helper(i + 1)
            false_val, _ = helper(next_i + 2)  # skip over ':'
            return true_val if expression[i - 1] == 'T' else false_val, next_i

        val, _ = helper(len(expression) - 1)
        return val
```

> **Trade‑off** – recursion is readable but uses **O(n)** stack space. For `n ≤ 10^4` this is fine in Python, but in interviews you might want the iterative version.

---

### 3.3  C++ – Iterative, Stackless

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string parseTernary(string expression) {
        int i = expression.size() - 1;          // index of current value
        char result = expression[i];            // current result
        i--;                                    // move left to the preceding char

        while (i >= 0) {
            if (expression[i] == '?') {
                if (expression[i - 1] == 'T')
                    result = expression[i + 1];      // true branch
                else
                    result = expression[i + 3];      // false branch
                i -= 2;                              // skip processed parts
            } else {
                i--;                                 // skip non‑operator char
            }
        }
        return string(1, result);
    }
};
```

> **Why C++?** The logic is identical to Java; just keep an eye on 0‑based indexing and string construction.

## 4.  “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly”

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Concept** | Straightforward right‑to‑left scan. | Must remember that ternary is right‑to‑left, which is counter‑intuitive. | Forgetting the right‑to‑left rule leads to incorrect branch selection. |
| **Implementation** | O(n) time, O(1) space. | Requires careful index arithmetic; off‑by‑one errors are common. | Recursive version can blow the stack for deep nesting (`n = 10^4`). |
| **Readability** | Iterative solution is concise. | Stack‑based solution (push/pop) can be verbose. | Mixing recursion with string slicing in Python may obscure logic. |
| **Performance** | Fast – single pass. | No big‑O penalties. | None – the stackless solution is optimal. |
| **Edge Cases** | Handles `T`, `F`, and digits uniformly. | Needs to correctly skip `:` when taking false branch. | Accidentally treating the `:` as part of the value can produce wrong output. |

### 5.1  Introduction

If you’re hunting for a **software engineer** position, you’ve probably seen LeetCode’s “Ternary Expression Parser” (ID 439). It’s a surprisingly subtle problem that tests your understanding of *right‑to‑left evaluation* and your ability to write clean, efficient code in **Java, Python, or C++**.

This article walks you through:

1. **The problem statement** – what we’re solving and why it matters.
2. **The core algorithm** – why a right‑to‑left scan is the magic trick.
3. **Three language‑specific solutions** – ready‑to‑paste code you can use in interviews.
4. **Common pitfalls** – the good, the bad, and the ugly.
5. **How to talk about it on your resume and in interviews** – turning a coding exercise into a career advantage.

### 5.2  Problem Recap

> *Given a string that represents a ternary expression with digits, `T` (true), `F` (false), `?`, and `:` – evaluate the expression and return the final result.*

Key constraints:

- Expression length: 5–10,000 characters.
- Each digit is one‑character (`0–9`).
- The expression is **valid** and **right‑to‑left** grouped.

---

### 5.3  Why the Right‑to‑Left Scan Works

When you read a ternary expression from the rightmost character, you already know the *value* that belongs to the *true* or *false* branch of the nearest `?`. The character just before that `?` tells you which side to take. By repeatedly stripping the innermost expression, you collapse the entire expression to a single value.

This observation removes the need for an explicit stack or recursion (although those are great ways to think about the problem). It also guarantees **O(n)** time and **O(1)** auxiliary space.

---

### 5.4  Language‑Specific Implementations

> **Tip** – In interviews, start with the *iterative* solution (Java/C++) and mention that you can easily convert it to Python. Highlight the right‑to‑left rationale.

#### 5.4.1 Java – Iterative, Stackless

```java
public class Solution {
    public String parseTernary(String expression) {
        int i = expression.length() - 1;          // rightmost index
        char result = expression.charAt(i);       // current value
        i--;

        while (i >= 0) {
            if (expression.charAt(i) == '?') {
                // 'T' or 'F' is just before '?'
                if (expression.charAt(i - 1) == 'T')
                    result = expression.charAt(i + 1);      // true branch
                else
                    result = expression.charAt(i + 3);      // false branch
                i -= 2;                                 // skip processed part
            } else {
                i--;                                    // skip non‑operator
            }
        }
        return String.valueOf(result);
    }
}
```

#### 5.4.2 Python – Recursive (Elegant)

```python
class Solution:
    def parseTernary(self, expression: str) -> str:
        def helper(i: int) -> (str, int):
            # If current char is a value, return it
            if expression[i].isdigit() or expression[i] in 'TF':
                return expression[i], i

            # Expression[i] == '?'
            true_val, next_i = helper(i + 1)
            false_val, _ = helper(next_i + 2)      # skip over ':'
            return true_val if expression[i - 1] == 'T' else false_val, next_i

        val, _ = helper(len(expression) - 1)
        return val
```

#### 5.4.3 C++ – Iterative, Stackless

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string parseTernary(string expression) {
        int i = expression.size() - 1;          // rightmost
        char result = expression[i];
        i--;

        while (i >= 0) {
            if (expression[i] == '?') {
                if (expression[i - 1] == 'T')
                    result = expression[i + 1];
                else
                    result = expression[i + 3];
                i -= 2;
            } else {
                i--;
            }
        }
        return string(1, result);
    }
};
```

> **Performance note** – All three run in a single pass and are ready for large inputs.

### 5.5  Common Pitfalls & Interview “Soft” Talking

| Pitfall | How to Avoid | Interview Talking Point |
|---------|--------------|------------------------|
| Misreading the operator order | Remind yourself: **ternary is right‑to‑left**. | “I started from the right to guarantee inner expressions are resolved first.” |
| Off‑by‑one errors | Use `i - 1` and `i + 3` carefully. | “I validate indices before accessing them to avoid `IndexError`.” |
| Stack overflow in recursion | Use iterative version or add tail‑call optimization. | “I can switch to an iterative solution to stay O(1) in space.” |
| Forgetting to skip `:` in false branch | Explicitly move two indices beyond `:`. | “When taking the false branch, I jump over the colon to get the correct value.” |
