        # Jump Game‚ÄØII ‚Äì LeetCode #45  
**A Complete, Job‚ÄëReady Guide (Java / Python / C++)**

> *‚ÄúThe good, the bad, and the ugly‚Äù* ‚Äì how to solve the problem, what to avoid, and how to impress interviewers.

## 1. Problem Recap (LeetCode #45)

> **Jump Game‚ÄØII**  
> **Difficulty:** Medium  
> **Signature (Java):** `public int jump(int[] nums);`

You‚Äôre standing at index‚ÄØ0 of an array `nums`.  
`nums[i]` is the *maximum* distance you can jump forward from that index.  
Your goal is to reach the last index (`n‚Äë1`) using the **fewest jumps possible**.  
The problem guarantees that the last index is always reachable.

---

## 2. Brute‚ÄëForce vs. Optimal

| Approach | Time | Space | Why It‚Äôs Not Ideal |
|----------|------|-------|--------------------|
| DFS / Recursion with memo | **O(2‚Åø)** | O(n) recursion | Exponential blow‚Äëup; fails on 10‚Å¥ length |
| Dynamic Programming (DP) | **O(n¬≤)** | O(n) | Nested loops; still too slow for 10‚Å¥ |
| Greedy (optimal) | **O(n)** | O(1) | One pass, constant memory |

The greedy strategy is the only one that scales to the maximum constraints (`n ‚â§ 10‚Å¥`).  

---

## 3. Greedy Insight

Think of the array as a ‚Äúroad‚Äù and each index as a ‚Äúcheckpoint‚Äù.  
From any checkpoint you can drive at most `nums[i]` units ahead.  
The key observation: **If you know the furthest position you can reach with `k` jumps, you can decide the optimal `k+1`‚Äëth jump without looking at future jumps.**

Algorithm steps:

1. **Maintain** three variables:  
   * `currentEnd` ‚Äì the furthest index we can reach with the current number of jumps.  
   * `farthest` ‚Äì the furthest index we can reach from all indices **up to** `currentEnd`.  
   * `jumps` ‚Äì number of jumps taken so far.
2. Iterate over each index `i` (except the last one).  
3. Update `farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i])`.  
4. When `i` reaches `currentEnd`, we must make another jump:  
   * `jumps++`  
   * `currentEnd = farthest`
5. Stop once `currentEnd` reaches or surpasses the last index.

Why it works: Every time we finish the current ‚Äúreachable segment‚Äù (`currentEnd`), we‚Äôre forced to jump to the best possible spot within that segment (`farthest`). This is guaranteed to be optimal because any other choice would not let us reach further with the same number of jumps.

## 4. Code

Below are **three** full, ready‚Äëto‚Äëpaste solutions ‚Äì one for each of the most common interview languages.

### 4.1 Java (LeetCode‚Äëstyle)

```java
/**
 * 45. Jump Game II ‚Äì Greedy solution
 * Time   : O(n)
 * Space  : O(1)
 */
public class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        int jumps = 0;          // number of jumps taken
        int currentEnd = 0;     // furthest index reachable with current jumps
        int farthest = 0;       // furthest index reachable with one more jump

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) { // no need to jump from last index
            farthest = Math.max(farthest, i + nums[i]);

            // If we have reached the end of the current jump range,
            // we must make another jump.
            if (i == currentEnd) {
                jumps++;
                currentEnd = farthest;

                // Early exit: if we can already reach the last index.
                if (currentEnd >= nums.length - 1) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return jumps;
    }
}
```

> **Tips for Interviewers**  
> ‚Ä¢ Mention that the loop stops before the last index because the job is done when you reach it.  
> ‚Ä¢ Emphasize the O(1) space usage ‚Äì a strong point for large inputs.

### 4.2 Python (3.x)

```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        """Greedy O(n) solution for Jump Game II."""
        jumps, current_end, farthest = 0, 0, 0

        for i, jump in enumerate(nums[:-1]):   # last index needs no jump
            farthest = max(farthest, i + jump)

            if i == current_end:               # must extend the jump
                jumps += 1
                current_end = farthest
                if current_end >= len(nums) - 1:
                    break

        return jumps
```

> **Why Python?**  
> ‚Ä¢ Clear readability ‚Äì `enumerate` hides the index tracking.  
> ‚Ä¢ Type hints (`list[int]`) help static analysis tools.

---

### 4.3 C++ (Modern, GNU++17)

```cpp
/**
 * 45. Jump Game II ‚Äì Greedy
 * Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int jumps = 0, currentEnd = 0, farthest = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
            farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i]);

            if (i == currentEnd) {          // need to jump
                ++jumps;
                currentEnd = farthest;

                if (currentEnd >= nums.size() - 1)
                    break;
            }
        }
        return jumps;
    }
};
```

> **Key C++ Highlights**  
> ‚Ä¢ `vector<int>& nums` ‚Äì avoid unnecessary copies.  
> ‚Ä¢ Use `size_t` if you want to avoid signed‚Äëunsigned warnings (optional).

## 5. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Algorithm** | Greedy is *optimal*, O(n) | Brute‚Äëforce DP is *O(n¬≤)* | Over‚Äëengineering with recursion + memo, hard to read |
| **Space** | O(1) | O(n) for DP arrays | Recursion stack blowing up |
| **Edge Cases** | Handles `nums[i] == 0` gracefully | DP may mis‚Äëcount if not careful | Forgetting to exclude the last element from the loop |
| **Readability** | Clear variable names (`currentEnd`, `farthest`) | Confusing names (`reach`, `maxReach`) | Mixing loops and `if` conditions without comments |
| **Performance** | Fast on 10‚Å¥ inputs | Slow on large tests | Timeout or MLE in contests |
| **Interview Talk** | Explain greedy intuition; mention ‚Äúreachability segments‚Äù | Avoid just saying ‚ÄúI used DP‚Äù | Skip explaining why you‚Äôre not re‚Äëjumping from the same index |

### 6.1 Introduction

If you‚Äôre prepping for a software engineering interview, you‚Äôll soon encounter **Jump Game‚ÄØII** ‚Äì a classic problem that tests both your algorithmic thinking and coding skill. In this article, we break down the greedy solution that runs in linear time, provide full implementations in Java, Python, and C++, and highlight the pitfalls interviewers love to ask about.

---

### 6.2 Problem Summary

* **Goal:** Minimum jumps to reach the last array index.  
* **Input:** Array `nums` where `nums[i]` is the max jump length from `i`.  
* **Guarantee:** Last index is always reachable.

---

### 6.3 Why Greedy is the Winning Strategy

- **Linear Pass:** We only iterate once (`O(n)`), perfect for `n ‚â§ 10‚Å¥`.  
- **Constant Space:** No extra arrays ‚Äì just a handful of integers.  
- **Intuition:** Treat each index as a ‚Äúcheckpoint.‚Äù Once you‚Äôve explored all positions up to the current checkpoint, you‚Äôre forced to jump to the farthest reachable point. This is the only choice that keeps the jump count minimal.

---

### 6.4 Code Walkthrough (Java)

```java
public int jump(int[] nums) {
    int jumps = 0, currentEnd = 0, farthest = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        farthest = Math.max(farthest, i + nums[i]);
        if (i == currentEnd) {
            jumps++;
            currentEnd = farthest;
            if (currentEnd >= nums.length - 1) break;
        }
    }
    return jumps;
}
```

- `farthest`: furthest index reachable from the current segment.  
- `currentEnd`: boundary of the current jump.  
- When `i == currentEnd`, we ‚Äúcommit‚Äù a new jump.

> The logic is identical; only syntax changes.

---

### 6.6 Common Interview Questions

1. **Why does the algorithm not revisit indices?**  
   Because once we finish the current reach, we must jump forward ‚Äì revisiting would waste jumps.

2. **What if `nums[i]` is zero?**  
   The algorithm naturally handles it; `farthest` won‚Äôt change, and the next `i == currentEnd` triggers a new jump (or the guarantee ensures we never get stuck).

3. **Can you prove optimality?**  
   By induction on the jump count: the farthest reachable position after `k` jumps is the best we can do with `k` jumps; thus the greedy jump is optimal.

---

### 6.7 How to Nail the Interview

- **Explain the intuition** before writing code.  
- **Use comments** to annotate `currentEnd` vs. `farthest`.  
- **Highlight edge cases** (zeros, single‚Äëelement arrays).  
- **Mention complexity**: *O(n)* time, *O(1)* space ‚Äì a key selling point.

### 6.8 Takeaway

Jump Game‚ÄØII is a showcase problem: a short description, a clever greedy solution, and clean code in three popular languages. Master it, and you‚Äôll have a conversation starter that demonstrates problem‚Äësolving, coding proficiency, and an eye for efficiency ‚Äì exactly what interviewers want.

Happy coding and good luck with your job hunt! üöÄ
