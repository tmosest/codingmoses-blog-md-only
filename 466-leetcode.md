### üìå Problem Recap (LeetCode 466)

> You‚Äôre given two strings `s1` & `s2` and two integers `n1`, `n2`.  
> Define `str1 = [s1, n1]` as the string created by concatenating `s1` `n1` times,  
> and `str2 = [s2, n2]` similarly.  
>  
> **Goal:** Return the maximum integer `m` such that `str2` repeated `m` times (`[str2, m]`) can be obtained from `str1` by deleting characters.  
>  
> **Constraints**  
> - `1 ‚â§ s1.length, s2.length ‚â§ 100`  
> - `1 ‚â§ n1, n2 ‚â§ 10^6`  
> - All letters are lowercase English.

## ‚úÖ Optimal Approach ‚Äì Cycle Detection

1. **Traverse `str1` once** while counting how many full `s2` blocks we can match.  
2. Keep track of two arrays:  
   * `indexR[i]` ‚Äì the position inside `s2` after processing the `i‚Äëth` block of `s1`.  
   * `countR[i]` ‚Äì the number of complete `s2` blocks matched up to that point.  
3. If the same `indexR` value re‚Äëappears, a cycle is found.  
4. Use the cycle to skip many `s1` blocks in constant time:  
   * `prevCount` ‚Äì matches before the cycle.  
   * `patternCount` ‚Äì matches per cycle * number of cycles left.  
   * `remainCount` ‚Äì matches in the leftover part of the cycle.  
5. Finally, `answer = (prevCount + patternCount + remainCount) / n2`.

Time Complexity: **O(n1 + n2)**  
Space Complexity: **O(n2)** (small, ‚â§ 101)

# The Good, The Bad & The Ugly of Counting Repetitions

> *SEO keywords: LeetCode 466, Count The Repetitions, coding interview, Java solution, Python solution, C++ solution, algorithm design, string manipulation, cycle detection, interview preparation, software engineering interview.*

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

> **‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòCount The Repetitions‚Äô problem is one of the trickiest string‚Äëmanipulation challenges on LeetCode.**  
> It‚Äôs a classic interview question for senior‚Äëlevel roles, especially at FAANG‚Äëtype companies, because it tests your ability to spot hidden cycles, optimize for O(10‚Å∂) operations, and write clean, bug‚Äëfree code.  

### Why It Matters

| **Job Role** | **Why You‚Äôll Face It** |
|--------------|------------------------|
| **Software Engineer** | String DP, interview standard |
| **Systems Engineer** | Needs to think about state‚Äëspace reduction |
| **Data‚ÄëEngineer** | Handles huge concatenated strings |

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement (Simplified)

> Given `s1`, `n1`, `s2`, `n2`, compute the maximum `m` such that `[s2, m]` is a subsequence of `[s1, n1]`.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Na√Øve & Inefficient Approaches

| Approach | Complexity | Practicality |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Brute Force** (enumerate all deletions) | Exponential | Impossible for `n1, n2 ‚â§ 10‚Å∂` |
| **Dynamic Programming over `s1` & `s2`** | O(n1 * n2) | Still far too slow for 10‚Å∂ |
| **Recursive + Memoization** | O(n1 * n2) | Memory blow‚Äëup, stack depth issues |

> **The bad part:** Even the DP solution gets timeouts on the upper bounds.  
> **The ugly part:** Many candidates write over 200 lines of code just to hit O(n1 * n2).

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Optimal Solution ‚Äì Cycle Detection (The Good)

### How It Works

1. **Single Pass over `str1`:**  
   * Keep an `index` inside `s2`.  
   * When `index == s2.length`, we finished a `s2` block ‚Äì reset `index` and increment `count`.  

2. **Store State Per `s1` Block:**  
   * `indexR[i]` ‚Äì where we‚Äôre in `s2` after processing the *i‚Äëth* block of `s1`.  
   * `countR[i]` ‚Äì how many full `s2` blocks have been matched so far.  

3. **Detect a Cycle:**  
   * If `indexR[i]` repeats, we‚Äôre back at a state we‚Äôve seen before.  
   * The sequence of `countR` between two identical `indexR` values is a cycle.  

4. **Jump Ahead:**  
   * `prevCount` ‚Äì matches before the cycle starts.  
   * `cycleLen` & `cycleCnt` ‚Äì length & matches per cycle.  
   * Compute how many full cycles fit into the remaining blocks and add the leftover matches.  

5. **Final Answer:**  
   * `answer = totalMatches / n2`  

> **Why It‚Äôs Awesome:**  
> * Handles the worst case (`10‚Å∂`) in just ~10‚Å¥ operations.  
> * Uses only a few integer arrays (‚â§ 101 elements).  
> * Clear logical flow that you can explain in an interview.

### Complexity

| Metric | Formula | Result |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Time** | `O(n1 + n2)` | ‚âà 2‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚Å¥ operations for max input |
| **Space** | `O(n2)` | ‚â§ 101 integers |

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Edge‚ÄëCase Checklist

| Edge Case | What to Watch For |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `s1` contains no letters from `s2` | `index` never advances ‚Üí answer is 0 |
| `s2` is longer than `str1` | `countR` stays 0 |
| `n1` or `n2` is 1 | Works seamlessly |
| `s1 == s2` | Cycle detection still works |
| Large `n1`, small `n2` | The cycle logic skips almost all work |

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Interview‚ÄëReady Tips

1. **Explain the idea of a ‚Äústate‚Äù inside `s2`.**  
   * Use the `index` variable and why resetting it after a match matters.  
2. **Talk about cycle detection.**  
   * Mention ‚Äúlooking for the same state twice‚Äù ‚Üí O(1) skip.  
3. **Show the formula for total matches** (prev + cycle √ó loops + remainder).  
4. **Highlight Big‚ÄëO numbers** ‚Äì Interviewers love seeing you can quantify performance.  

> **Sample Interview Answer**  
> ‚ÄúI iterate through each block of `s1`, keep track of where we are inside `s2`. When I encounter the same position again, I know the process will repeat, so I compute how many full cycles of `s1` I can skip and adjust the count accordingly. This reduces the complexity from `O(n1 * n2)` to `O(n1 + n2)`, which is crucial for the given constraints.‚Äù
