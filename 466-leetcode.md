        ## 1.  Problem Recap (LeetCode 466 – “Count The Repetitions”)

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `str = [s, n]` | the string `s` concatenated `n` times |
| `s1, n1` | the first block string and its repeat count |
| `s2, n2` | the second block string and its repeat count |

**Goal**  
Return the maximum integer `m` such that `str2 = [s2, m]` can be obtained from `str1 = [s1, n1]` by deleting zero or more characters from `str1`.

`n1` and `n2` can be as large as `10⁶`, so a naive simulation that expands the strings is impossible.

---

## 2.  Core Insight

While walking through `str1` we keep a pointer `index` into `s2` (the next character we’re looking for).  
Every time we hit the end of `s2` we have completed **one occurrence** of `s2`.

If we track

* `index` after finishing each block of `s1`
* how many complete `s2` occurrences we have found

then a **cycle** will eventually appear: the same `index` value will be reached again after some number of `s1` blocks.  
When a cycle is detected we can compute the number of `s2` occurrences inside the cycle and “fast‑forward” the remaining blocks instead of iterating them one‑by‑one.

This technique is a classic “**loop detection + fast‑forward**” strategy used in many LeetCode hard problems.

---

## 3.  Algorithm (pseudocode)

```
if n1 == 0: return 0

# Map from index in s2 to (block_number, count_of_s2_done)
record = {}

index = 0          # position inside s2
count = 0          # number of s2 completed so far

for block in 0 .. n1-1:
    for ch in s1:
        if ch == s2[index]:
            index += 1
            if index == len(s2):     # finished one s2
                index = 0
                count += 1

    # cycle detection
    if index in record:
        prev_block, prev_count = record[index]

        # numbers before the cycle
        prefix_count = prev_count

        # numbers inside one cycle
        cycle_len   = block - prev_block          # blocks in one cycle
        cycle_count = count - prev_count          # s2 completed in one cycle

        # how many full cycles fit in the remaining blocks
        remaining_blocks = n1 - 1 - block
        full_cycles = remaining_blocks // cycle_len

        total = prefix_count + full_cycles * cycle_count

        # remainder after the last full cycle
        rest_blocks = remaining_blocks % cycle_len
        for i in range(rest_blocks):
            for ch in s1:
                if ch == s2[index]:
                    index += 1
                    if index == len(s2):
                        index = 0
                        total += 1

        return total // n2

    # remember this state
    record[index] = (block, count)

# No cycle found – just finish
return count // n2
```

The algorithm runs in `O(n1 * |s1|)` time but because we fast‑forward once a cycle appears it effectively runs in `O(|s2| * |s1|)` – far below the limits.

## 4.  Code

Below are clean, idiomatic implementations in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.

### 4.1 Java

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int getMaxRepetitions(String s1, int n1, String s2, int n2) {
        if (n1 == 0) return 0;

        // state : index in s2 -> (block number, count of s2 found)
        Map<Integer, int[]> record = new HashMap<>();

        int index = 0;        // current position in s2
        int count = 0;        // number of complete s2 strings found

        for (int block = 0; block < n1; block++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
                if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(index)) {
                    index++;
                    if (index == s2.length()) {
                        index = 0;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }

            if (record.containsKey(index)) {
                int[] prev = record.get(index);
                int prevBlock = prev[0];
                int prevCount = prev[1];

                int prefixCount = prevCount;

                int cycleLen   = block - prevBlock;
                int cycleCount = count - prevCount;

                int remainingBlocks = n1 - 1 - block;
                int fullCycles = remainingBlocks / cycleLen;
                int total = prefixCount + fullCycles * cycleCount;

                int restBlocks = remainingBlocks % cycleLen;
                for (int r = 0; r < restBlocks; r++) {
                    for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
                        if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(index)) {
                            index++;
                            if (index == s2.length()) {
                                index = 0;
                                total++;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
                return total / n2;
            }

            record.put(index, new int[]{block, count});
        }

        return count / n2;
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Python

```python
from typing import Dict, Tuple

class Solution:
    def getMaxRepetitions(self, s1: str, n1: int, s2: str, n2: int) -> int:
        if n1 == 0:
            return 0

        record: Dict[int, Tuple[int, int]] = {}
        index, count = 0, 0

        for block in range(n1):
            for ch in s1:
                if ch == s2[index]:
                    index += 1
                    if index == len(s2):
                        index = 0
                        count += 1

            if index in record:
                prev_block, prev_count = record[index]

                prefix_count = prev_count
                cycle_len = block - prev_block
                cycle_count = count - prev_count

                remaining = n1 - 1 - block
                full_cycles = remaining // cycle_len
                total = prefix_count + full_cycles * cycle_count

                rest_blocks = remaining % cycle_len
                for _ in range(rest_blocks):
                    for ch in s1:
                        if ch == s2[index]:
                            index += 1
                            if index == len(s2):
                                index = 0
                                total += 1

                return total // n2

            record[index] = (block, count)

        return count // n2
```

### 4.3 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getMaxRepetitions(string s1, int n1, string s2, int n2) {
        if (n1 == 0) return 0;

        unordered_map<int, pair<int, int>> record; // index -> {block, count}
        int index = 0, count = 0;

        for (int block = 0; block < n1; ++block) {
            for (char ch : s1) {
                if (ch == s2[index]) {
                    ++index;
                    if (index == (int)s2.size()) {
                        index = 0;
                        ++count;
                    }
                }
            }

            if (record.count(index)) {
                auto [prevBlock, prevCount] = record[index];

                int prefix = prevCount;
                int cycleLen   = block - prevBlock;
                int cycleCnt   = count - prevCount;

                int remaining = n1 - 1 - block;
                int fullCycles = remaining / cycleLen;
                int total = prefix + fullCycles * cycleCnt;

                int rest = remaining % cycleLen;
                for (int r = 0; r < rest; ++r) {
                    for (char ch : s1) {
                        if (ch == s2[index]) {
                            ++index;
                            if (index == (int)s2.size()) {
                                index = 0;
                                ++total;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
                return total / n2;
            }

            record[index] = {block, count};
        }

        return count / n2;
    }
};
```

All three solutions share the same logic, only the syntax differs.

> **Title**  
> *Count The Repetitions: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly – A LeetCode 466 Deep‑Dive (Why It Helps You Nail Your Next Coding Interview)*

> **Meta‑Description**  
> A detailed, interview‑ready explanation of LeetCode 466. Learn the cycle‑fast‑forward trick, common pitfalls, and performance tricks. Boost your interview prep and impress hiring managers.

---

### 5.1 Introduction

> **Count The Repetitions** (LeetCode 466) is one of the most talked‑about “Hard” interview questions.  
> It tests your ability to observe hidden patterns, build a cycle‑based simulation, and write clean, fast code.  
> Mastering it not only gives you an A‑grade on LeetCode but also showcases skills that recruiters look for: algorithmic thinking, data‑structure knowledge, and real‑world performance engineering.

---

### 5.2 The Good – What Makes This Problem Elegant

| Why it’s good | Practical takeaway |
|---------------|--------------------|
| **Simple state machine** – `index` inside `s2` captures everything you need. | Shows you can reduce a seemingly huge search space to a tiny state graph. |
| **Cycle detection** – a hash map stores `index → (block, count)` and lets you fast‑forward. | Demonstrates a powerful trick that appears in many coding‑interview questions (e.g., “Count the Subsequence” variants, “K‑Sum” problems). |
| **Linear time after fast‑forward** – the loop runs only once per `s1` block, but the remainder is O(1). | Proves you can stay within LeetCode time limits even with `n1, n2 = 10⁶`. |
| **Clear, language‑agnostic logic** – works equally well in Java, Python, and C++. | Highlights your ability to translate algorithmic ideas across languages, a common interview requirement. |

> *Result:* O(|s1|·|s2|) time, O(|s2|) memory – comfortably below the 1 second limit.

---

### 5.3 The Bad – Things That Can Go Wrong

1. **Missing the cycle** – Without fast‑forward you’ll get `O(n1·|s1|)` and TLE.  
   *Fix:* Remember every `index` value; when you hit a repeat, you can fast‑forward.
2. **Incorrect remainder handling** – After the last full cycle you must simulate the **exact** remaining blocks, not just assume a linear pattern.  
   *Fix:* Simulate `restBlocks` *once* after computing the number of full cycles.
3. **Off‑by‑one errors** – Off‑by‑one mistakes in block counting (e.g., `n1-1` vs `n1`) are frequent.  
   *Fix:* Use clear variable names (`prevBlock`, `currentBlock`) and test with the official LeetCode samples.
4. **Large `n1` but small `s2`** – Some people mistakenly pre‑allocate large arrays of size `n1`.  
   *Fix:* Only store the map `record`, whose keys are at most `|s2|`.

---

### 5.4 The Ugly – Edge Cases & Common Pitfalls

| Edge Case | Why it matters | Quick check |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| `s2` contains a character not in `s1` | No `s2` can ever finish → answer is 0 | `if (!s1.containsAll(s2)) return 0;` |
| `|s2| > |s1| * n1` | Impossible to finish even one `s2` | The algorithm will naturally return 0 |
| `s1` and `s2` are identical | Cycle detection happens after the first block | Works fine because `index` will become 0 again |
| Very long strings (`|s1|, |s2| = 100`) | Map size stays ≤100, memory fine | No issue |

---

### 5.5 Performance Discussion

| Implementation | Worst‑case Runtime | Memory |
|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Java | O(|s1|·|s2|) | O(|s2|) |
| Python | O(|s1|·|s2|) | O(|s2|) |
| C++ | O(|s1|·|s2|) | O(|s2|) |

*Why it matters for hiring*  
Interviewers love candidates who recognize when an algorithm is “linear in the input length” but can still be **fast‑forwarded** to handle huge repetition counts.  
This problem forces you to:

* Model the problem as a **state machine**.
* Use a **hash map** for cycle detection – a classic interview trick.
* Write **robust, clean code** that passes all edge cases.

These are exactly the kinds of skills recruiters look for in senior software engineers, system designers, and algorithm specialists.

---

### 5.6 Conclusion

- **Good**: Elegant cycle detection, linear‑time after fast‑forward, language‑agnostic logic.
- **Bad**: A handful of subtle off‑by‑one errors and the need to handle remainders correctly.
- **Ugly**: The temptation to expand strings and a misunderstanding that you can simply loop `n1` times naively.

Mastering this problem gives you a **strong talking point** for any algorithm interview. It demonstrates deep understanding of state machines, memory‑time trade‑offs, and the importance of clean coding practices.

Happy coding – and good luck landing that dream job!
