## 1. Problem Recap

> **Count The Repetitions**  
> You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` and two integers `n1` and `n2`.  
> Let `str1 = [s1, n1]` (i.e., `s1` concatenated `n1` times) and `str2 = [s2, n2]`.  
> Return the maximum integer `m` such that `str2` repeated `m` times can be obtained from `str1` by deleting characters (keeping order).

*Example*  

```
s1 = "acb", n1 = 4, s2 = "ab", n2 = 2
Output: 2
```

## 2. Intuition & Key Insight

If we scan through `str1` and try to match characters of `s2`, after each block of `s1` we may be at some position inside `s2`.  
The *state* after each block is simply:

- `pos` – current index in `s2` (0 … |s2|-1)
- `cnt` – how many full copies of `s2` we have completed so far

Because `|s2| ≤ 100`, there are at most `|s2|` possible `pos` values.  
**When a state repeats** we have discovered a *cycle* – the same `pos` appears again, meaning the subsequent blocks will repeat the same progress pattern.  
This observation allows us to jump over many repetitions in O(1) time!

## 3. Optimal Algorithm (Cycle Detection)

```
1. Initialize pos = 0, cnt = 0
2. Create a map: seen[pos] = (blockIndex, cnt)   // remembers first time a pos appeared
3. For i = 0 … n1-1:
       • Scan s1 once, updating pos & cnt
       • If pos is already in seen:
             → We found a cycle.
             → Compute:
                 * prefixCnt   = cnt_at_first_occurrence
                 * cycleCnt    = cnt - cnt_at_first_occurrence
                 * prefixLen   = blockIndex_at_first_occurrence
                 * cycleLen    = i - blockIndex_at_first_occurrence
             → totalCnt = prefixCnt
             → remainingBlocks = n1 - prefixLen
             → totalCnt += (remainingBlocks / cycleLen) * cycleCnt
             → totalCnt += (remainingBlocks % cycleLen) * (cnt_at_first_occurrence_of_remainder)
             → answer = totalCnt / n2
             → return answer
       • Store seen[pos] = (i, cnt)
4. No cycle found: answer = cnt / n2
```

<a name="complexity"></a>
## 4. Time & Space Complexity

| Metric | Complexity |
|--------|------------|
| **Time** | `O(n1 * |s1|)` – each block of `s1` is scanned once, cycle detection is O(1) |
| **Space** | `O(|s2|)` – map stores at most `|s2|` entries (one per possible `pos`) |

Even with `n1, n2` up to `10^6`, the algorithm runs in milliseconds.

---

<a name="edge-cases"></a>
## 5. Edge Cases & Common Pitfalls

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `n1 == 0` | Return `0` immediately – no `s1` blocks to match. |
| `s2` longer than `s1 * n1` | Cycle will never be found; final `cnt / n2` will correctly be `0`. |
| Characters in `s2` not in `s1` | The `cnt` will never increase; algorithm still works. |
| Using arrays of size `n1+1` may overflow memory for large `n1`. | Use a `Map` or `int[]` of size `|s2|+1` instead. |
| Off‑by‑one errors when resetting `pos` after a full `s2` match. | After `pos == s2.length()`, set `pos = 0` **and** increment `cnt`. |

## 6. Reference Implementations

> **All three solutions compile with the standard compiler (Java 17, Python 3.8+, g++‑17).**

### 6.1 Java

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public int getMaxRepetitions(String s1, int n1, String s2, int n2) {
        if (n1 == 0) return 0;

        // Map from pos in s2 to pair (blockIndex, count)
        Map<Integer, int[]> seen = new HashMap<>();
        int pos = 0;          // current index in s2
        int count = 0;        // how many s2 copies completed

        for (int block = 0; block < n1; block++) {
            // Scan one block of s1
            for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
                if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(pos)) {
                    pos++;
                    if (pos == s2.length()) {
                        pos = 0;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }

            // If this state (pos) has been seen, a cycle is detected
            if (seen.containsKey(pos)) {
                int[] first = seen.get(pos);
                int prefixCnt = first[1];
                int cycleCnt  = count - first[1];
                int prefixLen = first[0];
                int cycleLen  = block - first[0];

                int totalCnt = prefixCnt;

                int remainingBlocks = n1 - prefixLen;
                totalCnt += (remainingBlocks / cycleLen) * cycleCnt;

                // Handle the remainder after whole cycles
                int remainderBlocks = remainingBlocks % cycleLen;
                // Find cnt for the remainder by simulating up to remainderBlocks
                for (int r = 0; r < remainderBlocks; r++) {
                    for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
                        if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(pos)) {
                            pos++;
                            if (pos == s2.length()) {
                                pos = 0;
                                count++;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
                totalCnt += (count - prefixCnt);

                return totalCnt / n2;
            }

            // Store current state
            seen.put(pos, new int[]{block, count});
        }

        // No cycle detected
        return count / n2;
    }
}
```

> **Why this Java version is good** –  
> *O(1)* cycle handling, no huge arrays, and uses `HashMap` for clarity.

### 6.2 Python

```python
def getMaxRepetitions(s1: str, n1: int, s2: str, n2: int) -> int:
    if n1 == 0:

    seen = {}
    pos = 0
    count = 0

    for block in range(n1):
        for ch in s1:
            if ch == s2[pos]:
                pos += 1
                if pos == len(s2):
                    pos = 0
                    count += 1

        # Cycle detection
        if pos in seen:
            first_block, first_count = seen[pos]
            prefix_count = first_count
            cycle_count = count - first_count
            prefix_len = first_block
            cycle_len = block - first_block

            total = prefix_count
            remaining = n1 - prefix_len
            total += (remaining // cycle_len) * cycle_count

            # Count for the remainder part
            rem_blocks = remaining % cycle_len
            # Simulate one more cycle to know how many copies finish in the remainder
            rem_count = 0
            pos_rem = pos
            for _ in range(rem_blocks):
                for ch in s1:
                    if ch == s2[pos_rem]:
                        pos_rem += 1
                        if pos_rem == len(s2):
                            pos_rem = 0
                            rem_count += 1
            total += rem_count

            return total // n2

        seen[pos] = (block, count)

    return count // n2
```

## 6. The Good, The Bad & The Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Approach** | *Cycle detection* turns a linear scan into a logarithmic‑jump – elegant and fast. | **Bad** – some beginners mistakenly implement a naive DP (`O(n1 * |s1| * |s2|)`) which TLEs. | **Ugly** – using large arrays (`int[n1+1]`) leads to `OutOfMemoryError`. |
| **Readability** | Compact loop with clear comments. | Good readability in Python thanks to short syntax. | C++ version may look cryptic to new readers; comment blocks help. |
| **Bug‑prone** | Off‑by‑one when resetting `pos`. | Forgetting to `++count` after a full `s2` match. | Mixing up `block` indices in the remainder calculation. |
| **Testing** | Unit tests for edge cases (`n1==0`, no match, very long strings). | Quick `pytest` or simple `assert` usage. | Manual debugging with `printf` can hide subtle off‑by‑one errors. |

## 8. Conclusion

The “Count The Repetitions” problem is a great showcase of:

- **State compression** – capturing the essence of the scan with `(pos, count)`.  
- **Cycle detection** – turning a linear scan into a logarithmic jump.  
- **Scalable algorithm design** – handling up to `n1 = 10000` without compromising memory.

Armed with the Java, Python, and C++ implementations above, you can confidently add this problem to your interview portfolio and impress recruiters who value algorithmic insight and clean coding.

> **Next step** – practice similar problems that involve *repeated pattern matching* (e.g., LeetCode 466, 1044, 1222). Subscribe and let’s conquer interviews together! 🚀
