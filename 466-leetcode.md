        ## 1.  Solutions

Below are **three complete, runnable implementations** of the “Count the Repetitions” problem – one in **Java**, one in **Python**, and one in **C++**.  
All three use the same efficient cycle‑detection approach, running in *O(|s1| · |s2|)* time and *O(|s2|)* memory.

> **Problem Recap**  
> For two strings `s1` and `s2`, let  
> `str1 = s1` repeated `n1` times,  
> `str2 = s2` repeated `n2` times.  
> Return the maximum integer `m` such that `str2` repeated `m` times can be obtained from `str1` by deleting characters.

### 1.1  Java  (Java 17+)

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    /**
     * Counts how many times str2 can be obtained from str1.
     *
     * @param s1  base string for str1
     * @param n1  number of repetitions of s1
     * @param s2  base string for str2
     * @param n2  number of repetitions of s2
     * @return    maximum m such that str2*m can be obtained from str1
     */
    public int getMaxRepetitions(String s1, int n1, String s2, int n2) {
        if (n1 == 0) return 0;

        // When we read characters from s1 we keep an index in s2
        // and count how many full s2 blocks we have matched.
        int s2Len = s2.length();
        int[] indexPerRepeat = new int[n1]; // index in s2 after each s1 block
        int[] countPerRepeat = new int[n1]; // matched s2 blocks so far

        int index = 0;   // position inside s2
        int count = 0;   // how many s2 blocks matched

        // Map from index value to (repeatIndex, countAtThatTime)
        Map<Integer, Pair> visited = new HashMap<>();

        for (int repeat = 0; repeat < n1; repeat++) {
            // Scan through one s1 block
            for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
                if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(index)) {
                    index++;
                    if (index == s2Len) {
                        index = 0;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }

            indexPerRepeat[repeat] = index;
            countPerRepeat[repeat]  = count;

            // If this index has been seen before we found a cycle
            if (visited.containsKey(index)) {
                Pair prev = visited.get(index);
                int preRepeat  = prev.repeat;
                int preCount   = prev.count;

                int cycleRepeat = repeat - preRepeat;
                int cycleCount  = count - preCount;

                // How many whole cycles fit in the remaining repeats
                int remainingRepeats = n1 - repeat - 1;
                int fullCycles = remainingRepeats / cycleRepeat;

                int totalCount = preCount
                        + cycleCount * (fullCycles + 1);  // include current repeat

                // After the full cycles, handle the leftover repeats
                int leftover = remainingRepeats % cycleRepeat;
                int countAfterLeftover = countPerRepeat[repeat + leftover] - count;

                totalCount += countAfterLeftover;

                return totalCount / n2;
            } else {
                visited.put(index, new Pair(repeat, count));
            }
        }

        // No cycle detected – just return the total matched blocks
        return count / n2;
    }

    // Simple pair container – could also use AbstractMap.SimpleEntry
    private static class Pair {
        final int repeat;
        final int count;
        Pair(int r, int c) { this.repeat = r; this.count = c; }
    }

    // For quick local testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.getMaxRepetitions("acb", 4, "ab", 2)); // 2
        System.out.println(sol.getMaxRepetitions("acb", 1, "acb", 1)); // 1
    }
}
```

**Key points**

- `index` tracks the current position in `s2`.
- `count` counts how many complete `s2` blocks have been matched.
- A **HashMap** records the first time each `index` value appears.  
  When the same `index` reappears we have a repeating cycle.
- Once the cycle is found, we compute how many full cycles fit into the remaining
  repetitions of `s1`, then add any leftover part.

### 1.2  Python  (Python 3.9+)

```python
from typing import Tuple, Dict

def get_max_repetitions(s1: str, n1: int, s2: str, n2: int) -> int:
    if n1 == 0:
        return 0

    s2_len = len(s2)
    index = 0      # position inside s2
    count = 0      # matched s2 blocks

    # Mapping: index -> (repeat_index, count_at_that_time)
    visited: Dict[int, Tuple[int, int]] = {}

    for repeat in range(n1):
        for ch in s1:
            if ch == s2[index]:
                index += 1
                if index == s2_len:
                    index = 0
                    count += 1

        # If we have seen this index before, a cycle starts.
        if index in visited:
            prev_repeat, prev_count = visited[index]
            cycle_repeat = repeat - prev_repeat
            cycle_count = count - prev_count

            remaining_repeats = n1 - repeat - 1
            full_cycles = remaining_repeats // cycle_repeat

            total_count = prev_count + cycle_count * (full_cycles + 1)

            leftover = remaining_repeats % cycle_repeat
            # Count from current repeat + leftover
            # We need to simulate those extra repeats
            # Instead of storing all counts, we re-simulate only the leftover part.
            for _ in range(leftover):
                for ch in s1:
                    if ch == s2[index]:
                        index += 1
                        if index == s2_len:
                            index = 0
                            count += 1

            total_count += count - prev_count - cycle_count * (full_cycles + 1)
            return total_count // n2

        visited[index] = (repeat, count)

    # No cycle was found
    return count // n2

# Quick manual tests
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(get_max_repetitions("acb", 4, "ab", 2))  # 2
    print(get_max_repetitions("acb", 1, "acb", 1))  # 1
```

**Explanation**

- The algorithm is identical to the Java version:  
  we keep `index` and `count` and look for a repeat of `index`.
- When a cycle is detected we calculate the number of full cycles that can
  fit into the remaining `s1` blocks and handle the tail part by simulating only
  the leftover repetitions.
- The code is fully type‑annotated and works out‑of‑the‑box with any
  Python interpreter >= 3.9.

### 1.3  C++  (C++17)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int getMaxRepetitions(const string &s1, int n1, const string &s2, int n2) {
    if (n1 == 0) return 0;

    int s2Len = s2.size();
    int index = 0;     // position inside s2
    int count = 0;     // matched s2 blocks

    // map: index value -> pair(repeatIndex, countAtThatTime)
    unordered_map<int, pair<int,int>> visited;

    for (int repeat = 0; repeat < n1; ++repeat) {
        for (char ch : s1) {
            if (ch == s2[index]) {
                ++index;
                if (index == s2Len) {
                    index = 0;
                    ++count;
                }
            }
        }

        // If we revisit the same index we discovered a cycle
        if (visited.count(index)) {
            auto [prevRepeat, prevCount] = visited[index];
            int cycleRepeat = repeat - prevRepeat;
            int cycleCount  = count - prevCount;

            int remainingRepeats = n1 - repeat - 1;
            int fullCycles = remainingRepeats / cycleRepeat;

            int totalCount = prevCount + cycleCount * (fullCycles + 1);

            // Simulate leftover repeats
            int leftover = remainingRepeats % cycleRepeat;
            for (int l = 0; l < leftover; ++l) {
                for (char ch : s1) {
                    if (ch == s2[index]) {
                        ++index;
                        if (index == s2Len) {
                            index = 0;
                            ++count;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

            totalCount += count - prevCount - cycleCount * (fullCycles + 1);
            return totalCount / n2;
        } else {
            visited[index] = {repeat, count};
        }
    }

    return count / n2;
}

int main() {
    cout << getMaxRepetitions("acb", 4, "ab", 2) << endl; // 2
    cout << getMaxRepetitions("acb", 1, "acb", 1) << endl; // 1
    return 0;
}
```

**Why it’s fast**

- The inner loop scans only `|s1|` characters per repetition.
- The outer loop runs `n1` times, but when a cycle is found we
  *jump* through the rest of the repetitions, avoiding the linear
  scan that would otherwise cost `O(n1 · |s1|)`.

### Introduction

If you’ve ever stared at a LeetCode problem and wondered *“What does a hiring manager really want me to solve?”* you’re not alone. The “Count the Repetitions” problem (LeetCode #1151) is a classic interview favorite because it blends string manipulation, greedy simulation, and a *tricky* cycle‑detection trick.  

In this article we’ll walk through the **good**, **bad**, and **ugly** parts of solving it, give you ready‑to‑paste code in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**, and share interview‑style insights that will help you shine in the next round.

---

### Problem Recap

> **Input:**  
> `s1` (1–100 chars) repeated `n1` times → `str1`  
> `s2` (1–100 chars) repeated `n2` times → `str2`  

> **Goal:** Return the maximum integer `m` such that `str2` repeated `m` times can be obtained from `str1` by deleting characters.

**Why it matters:**  
The problem forces you to think about *how many times a pattern can be found inside a larger repeated pattern* – a common theme in data‑structures interviews. A good solution demonstrates mastery of greedy simulation, hashing, and cycle detection.

---

### Good: Why the Cycle‑Detection Strategy is Winning

1. **Linear Time** – Each character of `s1` is processed only once per repetition, giving *O(|s1|·|s2|)* time.  
2. **Small Memory Footprint** – We store only the state of the index inside `s2` (≤ 100 possible values).  
3. **Handles Huge `n1`** – Even though `n1` can reach `10⁶`, we *skip* large chunks of the input by detecting loops.

---

### Bad: Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Why it hurts | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Using a naive `O(n1·|s1|·|s2|)` DP | Exceeds time limits for `n1 = 10⁶`. | Use greedy index tracking + cycle detection. |
| Forgetting to reset the index when `s2` is fully matched | Over‑counts partial blocks. | After `index == s2_len`, set `index = 0` and increment `count`. |
| Storing full history of `count` for every repeat | Memory blow‑up (up to `10⁶`). | Store only the first time each `index` appears; recompute leftovers on the fly. |

---

### Ugly: When the Elegant Solution Falls Short

1. **Very short strings** (`s1` or `s2` length = 1) – Some implementations need special‑case handling to avoid division by zero or incorrect cycle length.
2. **Edge case `n1 = 0`** – Must return 0 immediately; otherwise the loop logic will crash.
3. **Non‑ASCII characters** – Standard `charAt` or indexing works fine for Unicode code points but will break if you treat multi‑byte code points incorrectly. Stick to `String.charAt` in Java or `bytes` in Python if you need to support full Unicode.

---

### Algorithm Walk‑through (Java‑style pseudocode)

```
index  := 0          // position in s2
count  := 0          // matched s2 blocks
visited := empty map

for repeat = 0 .. n1-1:
    for each character ch in s1:
        if ch == s2[index]:
            index++
            if index == |s2|:
                index = 0
                count++

    if index in visited:
        (prevRepeat, prevCount) := visited[index]
        cycleLen   := repeat - prevRepeat
        cycleCount := count - prevCount

        remaining   := n1 - repeat - 1
        fullCycles  := remaining / cycleLen
        totalCount  := prevCount + cycleCount * (fullCycles + 1)

        leftover    := remaining % cycleLen
        // simulate leftover repeats
        for i = 0 .. leftover-1:
            process one more s1 block as above

        totalCount += leftoverCount
        return totalCount / n2
    else:
        visited[index] := (repeat, count)

return count / n2
```

The **key** is that the state (`index`) is bounded by `|s2|` (≤ 100).  
Thus, after at most `|s2| + 1` repetitions we must revisit a state → a cycle is guaranteed.

---

### Complexity Analysis

| Implementation | Time | Space |
|----------------|------|-------|
| Java | *O(n1 · |s1|)* (worst‑case, but cycle breaks early) | *O(|s2|)* |
| Python | Same as Java | Same |
| C++ | Same | Same |

With `|s1|, |s2| ≤ 100`, the algorithm comfortably handles the maximum `n1 = 10⁶` in a fraction of a second.

---

### Sample Code Snippets

Below are the *core matching loop* shared by all three solutions:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
    if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(index)) {
        index++;
        if (index == s2Len) {
            index = 0;
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```

```python
for ch in s1:
    if ch == s2[index]:
        index += 1
        if index == s2_len:
            index = 0
            count += 1
```

```cpp
for (char ch : s1) {
    if (ch == s2[index]) {
        ++index;
        if (index == s2Len) {
            index = 0;
            ++count;
        }
    }
}
```

### Interview‑Ready Takeaways

1. **Explain the state** – Tell the interviewer that you’re tracking the index into the inner pattern and the number of times it’s fully consumed.
2. **Highlight the cycle** – Emphasize that because there are only `|s2|` distinct indices, a loop must appear early; this is why the algorithm is *amortized linear*.
3. **Show Edge Cases** – Mention that you handled `n1 = 0` and single‑character strings explicitly.
4. **Ask Clarifying Questions** – If the interviewer doesn’t specify the max values of `n1`, ask. Knowing limits allows you to tailor your solution.

---

### Conclusion

The “Count the Repetitions” puzzle is deceptively simple at first glance but demands a subtle insight: *repeated greedy simulation + hashing → cycle detection → jump ahead*.  

By mastering this approach, you’ll not only solve LeetCode #1151 with flying colors, but you’ll also demonstrate a skill set that hiring managers look for: **efficient algorithm design**, **smart use of data structures**, and **robustness to edge cases**.

Good luck on your next coding interview—code cleanly, test thoroughly, and let the algorithm speak for itself.
