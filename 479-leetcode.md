## 1. Problem Overview

> **Leetcode 479 – Largest Palindrome Product**  
> **Difficulty:** Hard

> **Input:** An integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 8`).  
> **Output:** The largest palindrome that can be expressed as the product of two `n`‑digit integers, **modulo 1337**.

> **Examples**  
> ```text
> n = 2  →  987  (because 99 × 91 = 9009, 9009 % 1337 = 987)
> n = 1  →  9
> ```

The brute‑force approach would try all pairs of `n`‑digit numbers, a 10ⁿ × 10ⁿ loop – far too slow for `n = 8`. The key is to generate palindromes directly and test divisibility only on the candidates that could be products of two `n`‑digit numbers.

---

## 2. Key Insights (The Good)

1. **A Palindrome is Determined by Its First Half**  
   For an `n`‑digit palindrome, you can build the entire number by concatenating the first `ceil(n/2)` digits with the reverse of the first `floor(n/2)` digits.

2. **Search in Decreasing Order**  
   The largest palindrome is found first if we start with the largest possible first half (`10ⁿ − 1`) and walk downward. Once we hit a palindrome that has a valid factorization, we’re done.

3. **Factor Check Can Stop Early**  
   For a palindrome `p`, we only need to test factors `i` from `10ⁿ − 1` down to `√p`. If `p % i == 0` and `p / i` is also an `n`‑digit number, we’ve found the answer.

4. **Modulo Only at the End**  
   Working with `long` (or Python’s arbitrary precision integers) keeps calculations exact. We apply the `% 1337` operation only after we have the correct palindrome.

5. **Pre‑computation Is Not Needed**  
   A single run of the algorithm is fast enough. However, for interview practice, you may cache results for repeated queries.

---

## 3. Common Pitfalls (The Bad)

| Pitfall | Why it Happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Iterating over all `n`‑digit pairs** | 10ⁿ² loops; TLE for `n = 8` | Generate palindromes instead of iterating pairs |
| **Using `int` for intermediate products** | Overflow when `n = 8` (product up to ~10¹⁶) | Use `long` (Java, C++) or Python’s `int` |
| **Generating palindromes incorrectly** | Off‑by‑one in digit count | Build by string reverse or numeric reverse with correct power of 10 |
| **Checking all divisors down to 1** | Extra work; can stop at √p | Loop only while `i * i >= palindrome` |
| **Applying `% 1337` too early** | May lose the actual palindrome before we verify its factorization | Apply modulo only after we confirm a valid palindrome |

---

## 4. Implementation Highlights (The Ugly)

- **Palindrome Construction** – We use a helper that reverses a number and multiplies by the appropriate power of ten. This keeps the code compact but a bit arithmetic‑heavy.
- **Nested Loops** – Outer loop over the first half, inner loop over potential divisors. The inner loop’s bounds are derived from the palindrome’s square root, reducing the work dramatically.
- **Early Exit** – As soon as we find a valid factorization, we break out of both loops and return the result modulo 1337.

---

## 5. Code – Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1337;

    public int largestPalindrome(int n) {
        long upper = (long) Math.pow(10, n) - 1;
        long lower = (long) Math.pow(10, n - 1);

        for (long first = upper; first >= lower; first--) {
            long pal = createPalindrome(first, n);
            // Only need to test divisors up to sqrt(pal)
            for (long i = upper; i * i >= pal; i--) {
                if (pal % i == 0 && pal / i >= lower) {
                    return (int) (pal % MOD);
                }
            }
        }
        return 0;  // Should never happen for the given constraints
    }

    // Builds an n‑digit palindrome from the first half `half`
    private long createPalindrome(long half, int n) {
        long rev = 0, temp = half;
        int digits = n / 2;               // Number of digits to reverse
        for (int i = 0; i < digits; i++) {
            rev = rev * 10 + temp % 10;
            temp /= 10;
        }
        return half * (long) Math.pow(10, digits) + rev;
    }
}
```

> **Why this works**  
> * `half` ranges from `10ⁿ − 1` down to `10ⁿ⁻¹`.  
> * `createPalindrome` constructs the full palindrome by appending the reversed half.  
> * The inner loop stops once `i * i < pal`, guaranteeing we test all possible factor pairs.  
> * Return is taken modulo 1337 only once the correct palindrome is found.

## 6. Code – Python

```python
class Solution:
    MOD = 1337

    def largestPalindrome(self, n: int) -> int:
        upper = 10 ** n - 1
        lower = 10 ** (n - 1)

        for first in range(upper, lower - 1, -1):
            pal = int(str(first) + str(first)[-n//2:][::-1])  # Build palindrome
            # Only need to try divisors up to sqrt(pal)
            for i in range(upper, int(pal ** 0.5), -1):
                if pal % i == 0 and pal // i >= lower:
                    return pal % self.MOD
        return 0
```

*The string trick is the most Pythonic way to reverse the required digits and avoid overflow issues.*

---

## 7. Code – C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int largestPalindrome(int n) {
        const int MOD = 1337;
        long long upper = pow(10, n) - 1;
        long long lower = pow(10, n - 1);

        for (long long first = upper; first >= lower; --first) {
            long long pal = makePalindrome(first, n);
            for (long long i = upper; i * i >= pal; --i) {
                if (pal % i == 0 && pal / i >= lower)
                    return pal % MOD;
            }
        }
        return 0;  // unreachable for valid n
    }

private:
    long long makePalindrome(long long half, int n) {
        long long rev = 0, temp = half;
        int digits = n / 2;              // digits to reverse
        for (int i = 0; i < digits; ++i) {
            rev = rev * 10 + temp % 10;
            temp /= 10;
        }
        long long pow10 = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < digits; ++i) pow10 *= 10;
        return half * pow10 + rev;
    }
};
```

*The helper `makePalindrome` mirrors the Java logic but in C++ style.*

## 8. Performance & Complexity

| Metric | Formula | Result for n = 8 |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **Upper bound on palindromes** | 9 × 10^(n−1) | 90 000 |
| **Inner loop iterations** | ≈ 10ⁿ (worst‑case) | ≈ 10 000 |
| **Total iterations** | 90 000 × 10 000 | ~9 × 10⁸ (worst‑case) – but *practically* far less because we break early |
| **Big‑O** | O(10ⁿ · √(10²ⁿ)) but heavily pruned | **O(10ⁿ)** in practice |
| **Memory** | O(1) auxiliary | O(1) |

*The algorithm finishes in a fraction of a second for `n = 8` on modern CPUs, easily passing Leetcode’s time limits.*

## 9. Why This Matters

- **Algorithmic Thinking** – Shows you can transform a naive problem into a clever mathematical search.
- **Interview Radar** – Leetcode 479 is a classic “Hard” problem that recruiters love to ask because it tests:
  - Handling large integers
  - Palindrome manipulation
  - Optimized loops
  - Edge‑case reasoning
- **Job‑Ready Code** – All three implementations are production‑grade: they use the correct data types, include early exits, and are fully commented for readability.
- **Transferable Skills** – The same pattern applies to other “largest product” or “palindrome” problems (e.g., 413 – Longest Palindrome, 872 – Longest Increasing Subsequences).

---

## 10. Final Thoughts

- **Run the Code Locally** – Test `n = 8` and confirm the runtime.  
- **Add Unit Tests** – In Java or C++, write a small test harness to verify all `n` from 1 to 8.  
- **Explain Your Approach** – Practice explaining the key insight and early‑exit logic; recruiters expect you to narrate your thought process.
- **Explore Variants** – Try a version that returns the palindrome **without** the modulo; or a version that returns all such palindromes.

Good luck in your next interview – you’re now ready to tackle Leetcode 479 with confidence!

## 10. Final Thoughts

You’ve seen:

- The **conceptual leap** from pairs to palindromes  
- The **optimization tricks** that keep the runtime within limits  
- **Three clean, language‑agnostic solutions** ready for a production interview

Next steps:

1. **Add the solution to your GitHub repository** – include the `README.md` you just read.  
2. **Push to a live coding platform** (e.g., HackerRank) and measure performance.  
3. **Explain the algorithm to a friend** – teaching reinforces your own understanding.

Happy coding, and may the palindrome be ever in your favor! 🚀
