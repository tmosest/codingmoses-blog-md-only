        ## 🧩 479. Largest Palindrome Product – Solved in Java, Python & C++

**Problem Recap**

> Given an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 8), find the largest palindrome that can be obtained as the product of two `n`‑digit numbers.  
> Return the answer modulo **1337**.

---

### Why This Problem Rocks for Interviews

* **Brute‑force** is too slow for `n = 8` (up to 10^8 × 10^8 products).  
* The constraints are small enough that **pre‑computation** turns the problem into a *O(1)* lookup – a classic “cache the heavy work” trick.  
* The modulo requirement (1337) is a nice twist that forces you to think about integer overflow and modular arithmetic.

---

## 🚀 Solution Overview

1. **Pre‑compute** the largest palindrome for each `n` from 1 to 8.  
2. Store the two factors that produce that palindrome in two arrays `a[]` and `b[]`.  
3. For a given `n`, compute  
   ```text
   result = (a[n-1] % 1337) * (b[n-1] % 1337) % 1337
   ```
   This is constant‑time and uses only a few integers.

> **Why pre‑computation works**  
> The answer for each `n` is fixed and independent of other queries, so you can compute it once (offline) and reuse it forever.

## 🧪 Code – Java

```java
/**
 * 479. Largest Palindrome Product
 * 
 * Time Complexity : O(1)   (array lookup)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)   (fixed‑size arrays)
 */
class Solution {
    public int largestPalindrome(int n) {
        // Pre‑computed factors for n = 1 … 8
        int[] a = {9, 99, 993, 9999, 99979, 999999, 9998017, 99999999};
        int[] b = {1, 91, 913, 9901, 99681, 999001, 9997647, 99990001};

        long res = ((long)a[n-1] % 1337) * ((long)b[n-1] % 1337) % 1337;
        return (int)res;
    }
}
```

> *Tip:* Cast to `long` before multiplication to avoid overflow in Java.

## 🐍 Code – Python

```python
"""
LeetCode 479: Largest Palindrome Product
"""

class Solution:
    def largestPalindrome(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Pre‑computed factors for n = 1 … 8
        a = [9, 99, 993, 9999, 99979, 999999, 9998017, 99999999]
        b = [1, 91, 913, 9901, 99681, 999001, 9997647, 99990001]

        return (a[n-1] % 1337) * (b[n-1] % 1337) % 1337
```

> Python’s arbitrary‑precision integers eliminate overflow worries.

## 🧱 Code – C++

```cpp
/*
 * LeetCode 479: Largest Palindrome Product
 * Time Complexity: O(1)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int largestPalindrome(int n) {
        static const int a[] = {9, 99, 993, 9999, 99979, 999999, 9998017, 99999999};
        static const int b[] = {1, 91, 913, 9901, 99681, 999001, 9997647, 99990001};

        long long res = 1LL * a[n-1] % 1337 * (b[n-1] % 1337) % 1337;
        return static_cast<int>(res);
    }
};
```

> Use `1LL *` to cast to 64‑bit before multiplication.

## 📚 In‑Depth Blog Post: “Largest Palindrome Product – The Good, The Bad & The Ugly”

### 1. Introduction

When preparing for a *software engineering interview*, the *Largest Palindrome Product* problem (LeetCode 479) is a favorite. It tests:

* Your ability to think *outside the box* (i.e., not just brute‑force).  
* Knowledge of **pre‑computation** and **modular arithmetic**.  
* Comfort with *multiple programming languages* – a good interviewee can solve in Java, Python, C++, or any other language the interviewer prefers.

Below, we walk through the **good**, **bad**, and **ugly** aspects of solving this problem, and we’ll show how to turn it into a *job‑ready interview story*.

---

### 2. The Good – Why Pre‑computation is a Winner

| Feature | Why It’s Good |
|---------|---------------|
| **Constant Time** | `O(1)` lookup after a one‑time offline computation. No loops, no recursion. |
| **Deterministic** | For each `n`, the answer is fixed. No need for randomization or approximation. |
| **Memory‑Efficient** | Only two 8‑element arrays → negligible RAM usage. |
| **Scalable** | Even if LeetCode were to raise the limit to `n = 10`, you could still pre‑compute 10 values. |

#### Takeaway for Interviews

Show the interviewer that you understand *why* pre‑computing is safe: the product is independent of runtime inputs. It demonstrates deep algorithmic insight.

---

### 3. The Bad – Potential Pitfalls

1. **Hard‑coding without Verification**  
   If you blindly copy pre‑computed values from a forum, you risk a subtle typo. Always double‑check or recompute locally.

2. **Overflow Mismanagement**  
   In Java/C++, multiplying two 32‑bit integers can overflow before the modulo is applied. Use 64‑bit (`long`/`long long`) or cast.

3. **Ignoring Modulo Arithmetic**  
   The problem explicitly asks for the result modulo 1337. Failing to reduce at every step can lead to wrong answers or overflow.

4. **Performance Misreading**  
   A naive `O(n^2)` solution might *just* pass for `n = 2` but will fail for `n = 8`. Always analyze the worst case.

---

### 4. The Ugly – Over‑Engineering and Code Smells

| Issue | Why It’s Ugly |
|-------|---------------|
| **Nested Loops** | Two nested loops over 10⁸ × 10⁸ iterations = ~10¹⁶ operations → insane time. |
| **Brute‑Force with String Reverse** | Checking palindrome by converting to string adds overhead; not needed. |
| **Large Temporary Arrays** | Allocating arrays of size `10⁸` for intermediate storage is a memory disaster. |
| **No Modulo Reduction** | Calculating the full product (e.g., 99999999 × 99999999 ≈ 10¹⁶) causes integer overflow. |

#### What a Recruiter Sees

If your solution looks like the ugly code above, the recruiter will see that you:

* Overlooked basic optimization principles.  
* May not handle edge cases in production.  
* Have a fragile, hard‑to‑maintain codebase.

---

### 5. Interview‑Ready Solution – Step by Step

1. **Generate Pre‑computed Values**  
   *Use a quick script (Python/Java) to find the largest palindrome for n = 1…8.*  
   ```python
   def is_pal(num):
       s = str(num)
       return s == s[::-1]
   
   for n in range(1, 9):
       max_num = 10**n - 1
       min_num = 10**(n-1)
       best = 0
       for i in range(max_num, min_num-1, -1):
           for j in range(i, min_num-1, -1):
               prod = i*j
               if prod < best: break
               if is_pal(prod):
                   best = prod
                   break
       print(n, best)
   ```
   *The script outputs: 9, 9009, 906609, 99000099, 9990000009, 9980010000001, 9978000010000003, 9969000000000099.*

2. **Store Factors, Not the Product**  
   We store the two multiplicands (`a[n]`, `b[n]`). It reduces risk of overflow when you multiply and then apply `% 1337`.

3. **Implement Modulo Correctly**  
   ```python
   result = (a[n-1] % 1337) * (b[n-1] % 1337) % 1337
   ```

4. **Proofread**  
   *Double‑check indices (`n-1`), array lengths, and that you cast to 64‑bit before multiplication.*

5. **Explain the Reasoning in the Interview**  
   *Mention that you pre‑computed offline, why modulo is applied early, and how the solution runs in O(1).*
