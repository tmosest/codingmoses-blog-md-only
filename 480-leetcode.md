        ## 1.  The Problem Recap

> **Sliding Window Median**  
> You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.  
> A sliding window of size `k` moves from the left of the array to the right, one step at a time.  
> For every window, output the median of the `k` numbers inside the window.  
> If `k` is odd the median is the middle number in the sorted window.  
> If `k` is even the median is the *average* of the two middle numbers.  

Typical constraints:  
* `1 ≤ k ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^5`  
* `-2^31 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 2^31 – 1`  

The required precision is 1e‑5.

> **Why is this a “hard” LeetCode question?**  
> It tests your knowledge of balanced data‑structures, sliding‑window techniques, and careful handling of duplicate values.

## 2.  The “Good” Solution – Two Heaps + Lazy Deletion

The cleanest way to maintain a dynamic median is to keep two heaps:

| Heap | Keeps | Invariant |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `maxHeap` (a max‑heap) | lower half (<= median) | top = largest of the lower half |
| `minHeap` (a min‑heap) | upper half (>= median) | top = smallest of the upper half |

**Key Idea**  
* The median is either `maxHeap.top()` (odd `k`) or the average of `maxHeap.top()` and `minHeap.top()` (even `k`).  
* When inserting a new element we put it in the correct heap and then rebalance.  
* Removing an element that has *slid out* of the window is the hard part because Java / Python heaps have no `remove(element)` in O(log n).  
  We solve it with a *lazy‑deletion* map (`delayed`) that records how many instances of a value must be ignored when it appears on a heap top.

### 2.1  Java Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SlidingWindowMedian {
    public double[] medianSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Max-heap for lower half
        PriorityQueue<Integer> low = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        // Min-heap for upper half
        PriorityQueue<Integer> high = new PriorityQueue<>();

        // Map to remember counts of delayed deletions
        Map<Integer, Integer> delayed = new HashMap<>();

        int lowSize = 0, highSize = 0;   // logical sizes (ignore delayed)
        double[] ans = new double[nums.length - k + 1];
        int ansIdx = 0;

        // Helper: prune top of a heap if it's scheduled for deletion
        BiConsumer<PriorityQueue<Integer>, Integer> prune = (heap, sign) -> {
            while (!heap.isEmpty()) {
                int num = heap.peek();
                Integer d = delayed.get(num);
                if (d != null && d > 0) {
                    // delete this occurrence
                    delayed.put(num, d - 1);
                    if (delayed.get(num) == 0) delayed.remove(num);
                    heap.poll();
                    if (sign == 1) lowSize--; else highSize--;
                } else break;
            }
        };

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int num = nums[i];

            // 1. Insert new element
            if (low.isEmpty() || num <= low.peek()) {
                low.offer(num);
                lowSize++;
            } else {
                high.offer(num);
                highSize++;
            }

            // 2. Balance heaps so that |lowSize - highSize| <= 1
            if (lowSize > highSize + 1) {
                high.offer(low.poll());
                lowSize--; highSize++;
            } else if (highSize > lowSize) {
                low.offer(high.poll());
                highSize--; lowSize++;
            }

            // 3. Slide window out if we already have k elements
            if (i >= k) {
                int out = nums[i - k];
                // Mark for delayed deletion
                delayed.merge(out, 1, Integer::sum);
                if (out <= low.peek()) lowSize--; else highSize--;

                // Prune tops if necessary
                prune.accept(low, 1);
                prune.accept(high, -1);

                // Rebalance after deletion
                if (lowSize > highSize + 1) {
                    high.offer(low.poll());
                    lowSize--; highSize++;
                } else if (highSize > lowSize) {
                    low.offer(high.poll());
                    highSize--; lowSize++;
                }
            }

            // 4. Record median once we have a full window
            if (i >= k - 1) {
                if ((k & 1) == 1) { // odd
                    ans[ansIdx++] = low.peek();
                } else { // even
                    ans[ansIdx++] = (low.peek() + high.peek()) / 2.0;
                }
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

**Why is this “good”?**

* **O(n log k)** time – each insertion, deletion, or balance is O(log k).  
* **O(k)** extra space – two heaps + delayed map.  
* Handles duplicates correctly thanks to delayed deletion.  
* No need for a balanced binary search tree (e.g., `TreeSet`) – easier to understand for most interviewers.

### 2.2  Python Implementation

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def medianSlidingWindow(self, nums, k):
        low, high = [], []              # max-heap (as negatives), min-heap
        delayed = defaultdict(int)      # lazy deletion map
        ans = []
        lowSize = highSize = 0

        def prune(heap, sign):
            # sign = 1 for low, -1 for high
            while heap:
                num = -heap[0] if heap is low else heap[0]
                if delayed[num]:
                    heapq.heappop(heap)
                    delayed[num] -= 1
                    if sign == 1: lowSize -= 1
                    else: highSize -= 1
                else:
                    break

        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            # insert
            if not low or num <= -low[0]:
                heapq.heappush(low, -num)
                lowSize += 1
            else:
                heapq.heappush(high, num)
                highSize += 1

            # balance
            if lowSize > highSize + 1:
                heapq.heappush(high, -heapq.heappop(low))
                lowSize -= 1
                highSize += 1
            elif highSize > lowSize:
                heapq.heappush(low, -heapq.heappop(high))
                highSize -= 1
                lowSize += 1

            # slide
            if i >= k:
                out = nums[i - k]
                delayed[out] += 1
                if out <= -low[0]:
                    lowSize -= 1
                else:
                    highSize -= 1
                prune(low, 1)
                prune(high, -1)
                if lowSize > highSize + 1:
                    heapq.heappush(high, -heapq.heappop(low))
                    lowSize -= 1
                    highSize += 1
                elif highSize > lowSize:
                    heapq.heappush(low, -heapq.heappop(high))
                    highSize -= 1
                    lowSize += 1

            # median
            if i >= k - 1:
                if k % 2:
                    ans.append(-low[0])
                else:
                    ans.append((-low[0] + high[0]) / 2.0)

        return ans
```

### 2.3  C++ Implementation

C++’s `multiset` already gives us a balanced BST with ordered iteration, so we can maintain a *single* multiset and keep an iterator to the median. This approach is concise and perfectly O(n log k).

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<double> medianSlidingWindow(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        vector<double> res;
        multiset<int> window(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + k);
        auto mid = next(window.begin(), k/2);          // iterator to median

        for (int i = k; i <= nums.size(); ++i) {
            // add the new element (when i == k we already have one)
            if (i == k) {
                // nothing to do – we are at first full window
            } else {
                window.erase(window.find(nums[i - k])); // element leaves
                window.insert(nums[i]);                 // new element

                // move mid to keep it pointing at the median
                if (nums[i] < *mid) {
                    if (k % 2 == 0) ++mid;   // new element is on the left
                } else {
                    if (k % 2 == 1) --mid;   // new element on the right
                }

                if (nums[i - k] <= *mid) {
                    if (k % 2 == 0) --mid;   // removed element was on the left
                } else {
                    if (k % 2 == 1) ++mid;   // removed element was on the right
                }
            }

            // compute median
            if (k % 2) { // odd
                res.push_back(*mid);
            } else {     // even
                auto nextMid = next(mid);
                res.push_back((static_cast<double>(*mid) + *nextMid) / 2.0);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

**Why is this “good”?**

* Uses the STL’s balanced tree; no hand‑rolled heap balancing.  
* Keeps the iterator to the median so we can query in O(1).  
* Still **O(n log k)** – each erase/insert into the multiset is O(log k).

## 3.  The “Bad” (Simpler) Approach – Sorting Every Window

```python
def bad(nums, k):
    res = []
    for i in range(len(nums) - k + 1):
        win = sorted(nums[i:i+k])
        mid = len(win)//2
        if k % 2: res.append(win[mid])
        else:     res.append((win[mid-1]+win[mid])/2)
    return res
```

* **O(n k log k)** – far too slow for `k = 10^5`.  
* Works only on toy inputs; interviewers will immediately flag the inefficiency.  

This is the *bad* baseline that demonstrates the “why you can’t just re‑sort”.

---

## 4.  The “Ugly” Corner Cases

| Scenario | What can go wrong? | How to avoid it |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Duplicate numbers** | A naive `TreeSet` will collapse duplicates into one element, losing counts. | Use `multiset` (C++), or `TreeMap<Integer, Integer>` + iterator (Java), or delayed‑deletion maps (heap approach). |
| **Sliding window deletion** | Removing an arbitrary element from a heap is O(n). | Lazy‑deletion, or use a BST that supports delete in O(log n). |
| **Even `k` precision** | Integer division in some languages truncates. | Explicitly cast to `double` or `float` before division. |
| **Iterator invalidation** | In C++ `multiset::erase(it)` invalidates only `it`. | Keep the iterator and update it manually with `++` / `--`. |
| **Large negative numbers** | In Java max‑heap with `PriorityQueue<Integer>` works fine; in Python you need negative numbers for a max‑heap. | Stick to language‑specific idioms. |
| **Overflow when averaging** | `maxHeap.top() + minHeap.top()` might overflow 32‑bit int. | Convert to `long long` or `double` before summing. |

---

## 5.  Complexity Summary

| Approach | Time | Extra Space |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Two‑heap + lazy deletion | **O(n log k)** | **O(k)** |
| `multiset` + median iterator (C++) | **O(n log k)** | **O(k)** |
| Sorting each window (bad) | **O(n k log k)** | **O(k)** |

All solutions are acceptable for the official LeetCode solution, but the two‑heap approach is *the* most interview‑friendly.

### Sliding‑Window Median: Masterclass for Interviews

> **TL;DR** – Keep two heaps (max‑heap for the lower half, min‑heap for the upper half). Use lazy deletion to remove out‑of‑window elements in *O(log k)*. Complexity: **O(n log k)** time, **O(k)** space.

---

#### 1️⃣ Problem Deep‑Dive

In the real world you’ll often need to compute a statistic over a sliding window – think *rolling average*, *moving median*, or *online outlier detection*. The median is the *center* of the data and is robust to extreme values – that’s why it’s used in finance, sensor fusion, and anomaly detection.

Given the constraints (`n = 10^5`), any solution that re‑sorts each window (`O(n k log k)`) will time‑out. You need a data‑structure that supports **insertion, deletion, and retrieving the k/2‑th element** all in logarithmic time.

---

#### 2️⃣ Why Heaps Win

* A **max‑heap** lets you always know the largest element in the *lower* half.  
* A **min‑heap** gives you the smallest element in the *upper* half.  
* The median is either the top of the max‑heap (odd window) or the average of the two tops (even window).  

When the window slides, you remove an element that may be anywhere in the heaps. Removing an arbitrary element directly from a heap is expensive, but we can **delay** the deletion:

```
lazy[num]++   // mark that one instance of 'num' must be ignored
```

When an element surfaces at the top of a heap, we check if it’s marked for deletion; if yes, we pop it and decrement the lazy counter. This keeps each heap top clean and maintains O(log k) operations.

---

#### 3️⃣ Code Walk‑through

> **Java**

```java
public double[] medianSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
    // two heaps + delayed deletion map
    PriorityQueue<Integer> low  = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder()); // max‑heap
    PriorityQueue<Integer> high = new PriorityQueue<>();                           // min‑heap
    Map<Integer, Integer> delayed = new HashMap<>();
    int lowSize = 0, highSize = 0;

    double[] ans = new double[nums.length - k + 1];
    int idx = 0;

    // ... helper functions prune(), balance(), slide() ...
}
```

> **Python**

```python
class Solution:
    def medianSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[float]:
        # two heaps + Counter for lazy deletion
        low, high = [], []          # max‑heap (negatives)
        delayed = defaultdict(int)
        # ... rest of the code ...
```

> **C++**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<double> medianSlidingWindow(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        multiset<int> window(nums.begin(), nums.begin()+k);
        auto mid = next(window.begin(), k/2);
        // ... slide, prune, balance ...
    }
};
```

All three snippets share the same **invariants** and **time/space complexities**.

#### 4️⃣ Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Java/Python (Heap) | C++ (multiset) |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------|
| Insertion | `O(log k)` | `O(log k)` |
| Deletion  | `O(log k)` | `O(log k)` |
| Median   | `O(1)` | `O(1)` |
| **Total** | **O(n log k)** | **O(n log k)** |
| Memory | **O(k)** | **O(k)** | **O(k)** |

The **lazy deletion** ensures that you never pay more than `O(log k)` to remove an element, even though the actual element might be deep inside a heap.

---

#### 5️⃣ Handling Edge Cases

| Edge | Common Mistake | Fix |
|------|----------------|-----|
| Duplicate values | `TreeSet` collapses them | `multiset` (C++), `TreeMap` + counts (Java) |
| Even window size | Integer division truncates | Convert to `double` before dividing |
| Negative numbers | Max‑heap needs negatives in Python | Use `-value` for the heap |
| Overflow on sum | `max + min` may overflow 32‑bit | Convert to `long long` or `double` first |

---

#### 5️⃣ Interview Presentation

* **Start with a diagram** – draw two heaps and show how the median sits in the middle.  
* **State the invariants**:  
  * `low.size() == high.size()` or `low.size() == high.size() + 1` (depending on `k` parity).  
  * All elements in `low` ≤ all elements in `high`.  
* **Explain lazy deletion** in a sentence: “We’ll keep a counter of elements that need to be removed, and clean them when they reach the top.”  
* **Show pseudo‑code**: O(n log k) is the headline.  
* **Address “why it’s robust”**: median is less affected by outliers than mean, a good discussion point for finance/analytics roles.

Interviewers appreciate code that is *clear* and *testable*, so include unit tests for odd/even windows, duplicates, and negative numbers.

---

#### 6️⃣ Take‑away

1. **Two‑heap + lazy deletion** is the gold‑standard for sliding‑window median.  
2. For C++ users, a `multiset` with a median iterator can be even simpler.  
3. Always verify edge cases: duplicates, negative numbers, and even `k`.  
4. In an interview, articulate the *why* behind each operation, not just the *how*.  
5. Practice coding in all three languages – each company may test you on your preferred stack.

#### 7️⃣ Further Resources

* **Order Statistic Tree** – maintain the k/2‑th element in O(log n).  
* **Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick)** with two pointers – a neat offline solution for static arrays.  
* **Segment Trees with lazy propagation** – for range updates and queries.

---

#### 8️⃣ Wrap‑up

Sliding‑window median is more than a coding exercise; it’s a *real‑world data‑analysis* tool. Mastering it demonstrates your ability to:

* Choose the right data‑structure (heaps, BST).  
* Optimize for time/space under large inputs.  
* Think ahead about deletions and stale data.  

With the provided Java, Python, and C++ implementations, you’re ready to nail the LeetCode hard problem *and* ace the interview.
