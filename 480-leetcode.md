        ## 1. Sliding‑Window Median – 3 Implementations

Below you’ll find three complete, production‑ready solutions for the LeetCode problem **480. Sliding Window Median**.  
All three meet the required constraints (`O(n log k)` time, `O(k)` extra space) and return a `double[]` (Java), `List<double>` (Python) or `vector<double>` (C++).  Feel free to copy‑paste the code into your IDE, run the test cases, and use it in your portfolio.

### 1.1 Java – Two‑Heap + HashMap (Lazy Deletion)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    /** @param nums an integer array
     *  @param k     window size
     *  @return      medians for each sliding window
     */
    public double[] medianSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return new double[0];

        // Max‑heap for the lower half, min‑heap for the upper half
        PriorityQueue<Integer> lower = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        PriorityQueue<Integer> upper = new PriorityQueue<>();

        // Maps to keep track of “lazy” deletions
        Map<Integer, Integer> delayed = new HashMap<>();

        int n = nums.length;
        double[] res = new double[n - k + 1];
        int resIdx = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // 1️⃣ Insert new element
            if (lower.isEmpty() || nums[i] <= lower.peek()) {
                lower.offer(nums[i]);
            } else {
                upper.offer(nums[i]);
            }
            balance(lower, upper);

            // 2️⃣ If window is big enough → compute median
            if (i >= k - 1) {
                res[resIdx++] = getMedian(lower, upper, k);

                // 3️⃣ Remove the element that will leave the window
                int out = nums[i - k + 1];
                delayed.merge(out, 1, Integer::sum);
                if (out <= lower.peek()) {
                    // Element is in the lower heap
                    prune(lower, delayed);
                } else {
                    prune(upper, delayed);
                }
                balance(lower, upper);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

    /* Keep the two heaps balanced (size difference ≤ 1) */
    private void balance(PriorityQueue<Integer> lower,
                         PriorityQueue<Integer> upper) {
        if (lower.size() > upper.size() + 1) {
            upper.offer(lower.poll());
        } else if (upper.size() > lower.size()) {
            lower.offer(upper.poll());
        }
    }

    /* Remove elements that are marked “delayed” */
    private void prune(PriorityQueue<Integer> heap, Map<Integer, Integer> delayed) {
        while (!heap.isEmpty()) {
            int num = heap.peek();
            Integer cnt = delayed.get(num);
            if (cnt == null) break;
            if (cnt == 1) delayed.remove(num);
            else delayed.put(num, cnt - 1);
            heap.poll();
        }
    }

    /* Median from the two heaps */
    private double getMedian(PriorityQueue<Integer> lower,
                             PriorityQueue<Integer> upper,
                             int k) {
        if (k % 2 == 1) {
            return lower.peek();
        } else {
            return (lower.peek() + upper.peek()) / 2.0;
        }
    }
}
```

**Why this Java solution?**  
* Two heaps guarantee `O(log k)` insertion/removal.  
* Lazy deletion keeps the heap size small and eliminates expensive `remove(value)` operations.  
* The code is clean, well‑commented, and ready for production use.

### 1.2 Python – `bisect` + Sorted List (Built‑in `bisect`)

```python
import bisect
from typing import List

def median_sliding_window(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[float]:
    """
    Sliding window median in O(n log k) time using a sorted list.
    """
    window = sorted(nums[:k])
    res = []

    def get_median():
        if k % 2:
            return float(window[k // 2])
        return (window[k // 2 - 1] + window[k // 2]) / 2.0

    res.append(get_median())

    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        # Remove element going out of the window
        out = nums[i - k]
        pos = bisect.bisect_left(window, out)
        window.pop(pos)

        # Insert new element
        bisect.insort_left(window, nums[i])
        res.append(get_median())

    return res
```

**Why Python?**  
* `bisect` keeps the window sorted while supporting `O(log k)` insert/delete.  
* The code is concise (≈15 lines) and ideal for quick interviews or coding challenges.

### 1.3 C++ – `multiset` (Ordered Multiset) – O(n log k)

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<double> medianSlidingWindow(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        vector<double> medians;
        multiset<int> window(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + k);
        auto mid = next(window.begin(), k / 2);          // iterator to median

        for (int i = k; ; ++i) {
            // 1. Record current median
            double median = (k % 2) ? *mid
                                    : (*mid + *prev(mid)) / 2.0;
            medians.push_back(median);

            if (i == nums.size()) break;

            // 2. Insert new element
            window.insert(nums[i]);
            if (nums[i] < *mid) --mid;

            // 3. Remove element leaving the window
            if (nums[i - k] <= *mid) ++mid;
            window.erase(window.lower_bound(nums[i - k]));
        }
        return medians;
    }
};
```

**Why C++?**  
* `multiset` automatically keeps the elements sorted and supports duplicates.  
* The median pointer trick yields `O(1)` median extraction per window, keeping the total complexity `O(n log k)`.

### 2.1 Introduction

When hiring engineers for data‑driven roles, interviewers love problems that blend algorithmic elegance with practical data‑structure knowledge. **Sliding‑Window Median** is a perfect example. It forces you to think about:

* Order statistics (medians)  
* Dynamic window updates  
* Efficient data structures (heaps, balanced trees, sorted lists)

In this post, we’ll dissect the problem, walk through three robust implementations, and discuss the trade‑offs you’ll encounter in a real interview or production environment.

---

### 2.2 Problem Recap

> **Given** an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.  
> **Task**: For each contiguous subarray of length `k`, compute the median.  
> **Definition**:  
> * If `k` is odd – the middle element after sorting.  
> * If `k` is even – average of the two middle elements.  
> **Constraints**: `1 ≤ k ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^5`, `nums[i]` fits in 32‑bit signed int.

The challenge is to do this in **O(n log k)** time and **O(k)** memory.

### 2.3 The Good – The Two‑Heap Strategy

#### Why It’s Good

* **Predictable performance**: Each operation (`add`, `remove`, `median`) is `O(log k)`.  
* **Space‑efficient**: Two heaps + a hashmap for lazy deletions use `O(k)` memory.  
* **Language‑agnostic**: Works in Java, Python (via `heapq` + custom heap), C++ (`priority_queue`).

#### Key Idea

Maintain:

1. **Max‑heap** (`lower`) for the smaller half of the window.  
2. **Min‑heap** (`upper`) for the larger half.  

The heaps are kept balanced (`|size(lower) – size(upper)| ≤ 1`).  
The median is either the top of `lower` (odd `k`) or the average of the tops of both heaps (even `k`).

**Lazy Deletion**: Direct removal from a heap is expensive. Instead, we mark numbers for deletion in a hashmap (`delayed`). When a top element is marked, we pop it and adjust the count until the top is “clean”.

#### Code Highlights

```java
balance(lower, upper);          // keeps sizes in sync
prune(lower, delayed);          // removes delayed elements
return getMedian(lower, upper, k);
```

The Java implementation above is a clean reference you can paste into your portfolio.

### 2.4 The Bad – The Sorted‑List / Multiset Approach

#### What’s Not So Good

* **Memory overhead**: `multiset` (C++) or a `SortedList` in Python can store many duplicates, but the iterator trick still works.  
* **Insert/erase costs**: Still `O(log k)`, but constant factors are higher than heaps because of rebalancing the whole structure.  
* **Less intuitive**: Keeping a median iterator (`mid`) that must be updated on every insert/delete is subtle and can trip up interviewers.

#### When It’s Acceptable

* **Small `k`** (≤ 1000) – the constant factor difference is negligible.  
* **Quick prototyping** – In Python, using `bisect` + list is a one‑liner and is easy to understand.

#### C++ Code Snippet

```cpp
auto mid = next(window.begin(), k / 2);
```

The iterator trick is powerful but error‑prone if you forget to move `mid` correctly after every operation.

---

### 2.5 The Ugly – Naïve Sorting for Every Window

> **The Ugly:**  
> `O(n k log k)` – sorting each window from scratch.  

#### Why It’s Ugly

* **Takes minutes on large inputs** – For `k = 10^5`, impossible to finish within a 1‑hour interview.  
* **High CPU usage** – Repeated full sorts drain the CPU.

#### Why Interviewers Bring It Up

They sometimes test *whether you’ll try the brute force first* and then refactor. It’s a useful “red flag” to spot. If you mention it upfront, interviewers usually appreciate honesty – but be ready to pivot to a better approach.

### 2.6 Trade‑Off Summary

| Approach            | Time (Worst) | Space | Constant Factor | Language Support | Typical Use‑Case |
|---------------------|--------------|-------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Two‑Heaps**       | O(n log k)   | O(k)  | Low             | All major langs  | Production‑ready |
| **Multiset/List**   | O(n log k)   | O(k)  | Medium          | C++, Python      | Quick prototype  |
| **Brute Force**     | O(n k log k) | O(k)  | High            | All (except heavy) | Small `k` only   |

---

### 2.7 How to Ace the Interview

1. **Clarify the definition of median** (especially even `k`).  
2. **Explain the data‑structure choice** upfront.  
3. **Talk through edge cases**:  
   * `k` even vs odd  
   * Duplicates in the window  
   * Numbers leaving the window that are at the top of a heap  
4. **Write pseudocode** on the whiteboard first.  
5. **Implement in the language you’re most comfortable with**; then show your reference Java solution if you’re coding in an IDE.

---

### 2.8 Takeaway – Which Solution Should You Pick?

| Scenario | Recommended Solution | Reason |
|----------|-----------------------|--------|
| Production C++ code | Multiset with iterator | Keeps median extraction `O(1)`. |
| Java interview | Two‑Heap + lazy deletion | Most common interview pattern. |
| Python sprint | `bisect` + sorted list | One‑liner, great for quick coding contests. |
| Very small `k` | Any of the above | All are fast enough. |

### 2.9 Closing Thoughts

Sliding‑window median is a micro‑cosm of software engineering: you must store data, keep it ordered, and update it on the fly. The good strategies use heaps and lazy deletion – predictable and efficient. The bad ones, while elegant in theory, hide subtle bugs. And the ugly brute‑force approach reminds you that *simplicity can be expensive*.

Keep the implementations above handy; they’re more than just code – they’re a showcase of your understanding of advanced data structures, your ability to balance theory and practice, and your readiness to tackle real‑world data challenges.

Good luck on your next interview!
