### 1. Problem Recap

A **magical string** is a sequence of `1`s and `2`s such that the *lengths of consecutive blocks* reproduce the string itself.

```
s = 1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ‚Ä¶
          ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^  ^  ^  ^  ^   block lengths
lengths = 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ‚Ä¶
```

The task:  
Given an integer `n` (`1‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØn‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ10‚Åµ`), return how many `1`s appear in the first `n` characters of `s`.

---

### 2. Intuition

The string is generated **on the fly**:

1. Start with the known prefix: `1 2 2`.
2. Read the next length from the string itself (`idx` pointer).
3. Append a block of that length using the *other* digit (toggle between `1` and `2`).
4. Move to the next length.

Because each appended block is determined by the *already known* part of the string, we never need to know the whole sequence upfront. This allows an **O(n)** algorithm with a small constant memory footprint.

---

### 3. Core Algorithm (Pseudo)

```text
if n <= 3: return n == 1 ? 1 : 2  // the first 3 characters are 122

arr[0] = 1, arr[1] = 2, arr[2] = 2          // prefix
pos   = 3                                 // next free index
idx   = 0                                 // read pointer
curr  = 1                                 // next block digit (toggle 1‚Üî2)

while pos < n:
    len = arr[idx]                        // length to append
    for i in 0 .. len-1 and pos < n:
        arr[pos] = curr
        pos += 1
    curr = 3 - curr                       // toggle 1<->2
    idx += 1

count  = number of 1's in arr[0 ‚Ä¶ n-1]
return count
```

**Why it works**

- The first three elements (`122`) already encode the lengths of the first three blocks.
- Each subsequent block length is read from the already built part (`arr[idx]`).
- The `curr` variable alternates the digit (`1` then `2` then `1` ‚Ä¶), exactly matching the definition of a magical string.

The loop stops as soon as we reach `n` characters, so the algorithm is **linear** in `n`.

### 4. Code

Below are clean, production‚Äëready implementations in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.

#### Java (‚â§‚ÄØJava‚ÄØ11)

```java
public class Solution {
    public int magicalString(int n) {
        if (n <= 3) return n == 1 ? 1 : 2;   // 1 ‚Üí 1, 2‚Üí 2, 3‚Üí 2

        int[] arr = new int[n];
        arr[0] = 1; arr[1] = 2; arr[2] = 2;
        int pos = 3;      // next free index
        int idx = 0;      // read pointer
        int curr = 1;     // next block digit

        while (pos < n) {
            int len = arr[idx];
            for (int i = 0; i < len && pos < n; i++) {
                arr[pos++] = curr;
            }
            curr = 3 - curr; // toggle 1 <-> 2
            idx++;
        }

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == 1) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### Python‚ÄØ3

```python
class Solution:
    def magicalString(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 3:
            return 1 if n == 1 else 2

        s = [1, 2, 2]
        pos, idx, cur = 3, 0, 1

        while pos < n:
            length = s[idx]
            for _ in range(length):
                if pos == n:
                    break
                s.append(cur)
                pos += 1
            cur = 3 - cur      # toggle 1 <-> 2
            idx += 1

        return s[:n].count(1)
```

---

#### C++17

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int magicalString(int n) {
        if (n <= 3) return n == 1 ? 1 : 2;   // 1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 2

        vector<int> s(n);
        s[0] = 1; s[1] = 2; s[2] = 2;
        int pos = 3;       // next free index
        int idx = 0;       // read pointer
        int cur = 1;       // next block digit

        while (pos < n) {
            int len = s[idx];
            for (int i = 0; i < len && pos < n; ++i) {
                s[pos++] = cur;
            }
            cur = 3 - cur; // toggle 1 <-> 2
            ++idx;
        }

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (s[i] == 1) ++count;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### 5. Good, Bad, and Ugly

| **Aspect** | **Good** | **Bad** | **Ugly** |
|------------|----------|---------|----------|
| **Time Complexity** | **O(n)** ‚Äì linear, no nested loops. | *None* | Over‚Äëengineering with recursion or linked lists adds unnecessary overhead. |
| **Space Complexity** | **O(n)** array ‚Äì acceptable for `n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`. | Using a `String` to build the sequence can be *O(n¬≤)* due to string concatenation. | Holding the entire string in memory and then parsing again is wasteful. |
| **Readability** | Clear separation of *generation* and *count* phases. | Mixed logic (generation + counting in same loop) can obscure intent. | Hard‚Äëto‚Äëread code, e.g., toggling `curr` via `3 - curr` without explanation. |
| **Bug Prone** | Proper bounds checks (`pos < n`). | Forgetting the `if (pos == n) break` guard in the inner loop. | Using the *last element* of the array as the length (off‚Äëby‚Äëone). |

> **Tip:** Keep the two phases (building and counting) separate or at least clearly documented. This prevents subtle bugs when tweaking the algorithm.

# Mastering LeetCode‚ÄØ481 ‚Äì Magical String

**TL;DR**  
A *magical string* is a sequence of `1`s and `2`s where the lengths of its consecutive blocks reproduce the string itself.  
For any `n` (‚â§‚ÄØ100‚ÄØ000), you can count the `1`s in the first `n` characters in **O(n)** time with a tiny, language‚Äëagnostic algorithm.

## 1. Problem Overview

> *Given `n`, return how many `1`s appear in the first `n` elements of the magical string.*

- **String starts**: `1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ‚Ä¶`
- **Block lengths**: `1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ‚Ä¶` ‚Äì exactly the string itself.

> Why is this a good interview question?  
> It tests your ability to translate a *self‚Äëreferential definition* into an efficient iterative algorithm ‚Äì a classic ‚Äúbuild‚Äëand‚Äëread‚Äù pattern that shows up in many coding interviews.

## 2. Core Insight

The magical string can be generated **on the fly**:

1. **Prefix**: `122` is the seed.
2. **Read pointer** (`idx`) scans the string to get the next block length.
3. **Toggle** (`curr`) switches between `1` and `2` for each new block.
4. **Stop** when you have `n` characters.

This eliminates the need to know the entire sequence beforehand, giving an **O(n)** solution.

## 3. Implementation Details

### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public int magicalString(int n) {
        if (n <= 3) return n == 1 ? 1 : 2;
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        arr[0] = 1; arr[1] = 2; arr[2] = 2;
        int pos = 3, idx = 0, curr = 1;
        while (pos < n) {
            int len = arr[idx];
            for (int i = 0; i < len && pos < n; i++) arr[pos++] = curr;
            curr = 3 - curr;  // toggle 1‚Üî2
            idx++;
        }
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) if (arr[i] == 1) count++;
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def magicalString(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 3:
            return 1 if n == 1 else 2
        s = [1, 2, 2]
        pos, idx, cur = 3, 0, 1
        while pos < n:
            length = s[idx]
            for _ in range(length):
                if pos == n: break
                s.append(cur)
                pos += 1
            cur = 3 - cur
            idx += 1
        return s[:n].count(1)
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int magicalString(int n) {
        if (n <= 3) return n == 1 ? 1 : 2;
        vector<int> s(n);
        s[0] = 1; s[1] = 2; s[2] = 2;
        int pos = 3, idx = 0, cur = 1;
        while (pos < n) {
            int len = s[idx];
            for (int i = 0; i < len && pos < n; ++i) s[pos++] = cur;
            cur = 3 - cur;
            ++idx;
        }
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) if (s[i] == 1) ++cnt;
        return cnt;
    }
};
```

## 4. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Using a `StringBuilder` and concatenating each character | Build with an `int[]` or `List<int>` to keep O(n) |
| Forgetting bounds (`pos < n`) in the inner loop | Add a guard or break after reaching `n` |
| Mixing generation and counting logic | Separate the two phases for clarity |

## 5. How This Helps Your Interview

- **Demonstrate iterative thinking**: The algorithm shows you can transform a recursive or formulaic description into a loop.
- **Showcase language strengths**: Provide the same solution in Java, Python, and C++ ‚Äì a great way to impress recruiters who value multi‚Äëlanguage fluency.
- **Practice ‚Äúbuild‚Äëand‚Äëread‚Äù patterns**: These are prevalent in questions about *zig‚Äëzag sequences*, *self‚Äësimilar strings*, and even *run‚Äëlength encoded data*.

## 5. Takeaway

- **Algorithm**: Build the magical string incrementally, stopping at `n`.
- **Complexity**: **O(n)** time, **O(n)** space (acceptable for `n ‚â§ 100‚ÄØ000`).
- **Interview Edge**: Leverage the *self‚Äëreferential* nature to explain your logic clearly ‚Äì this is what hiring managers look for.

Happy coding, and good luck on your next technical interview!
