        # Solving LeetCode 481 – “Magical String” in Java, Python, and C++

Below you’ll find three **production‑ready solutions** that work for every input in the given constraints  
(1 ≤ *n* ≤ 100 000).  
After the code we’ll dive into a short, SEO‑friendly blog post that explains the problem, the algorithm, and the “good, bad and ugly” parts that every interview‑candidate should know.

## 1. Java 17

```java
class Solution {
    public int magicalString(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;          // defensive – problem guarantees n ≥ 1
        int[] s = new int[n];          // the magical string (1 or 2)
        s[0] = 1; s[1] = 2; s[2] = 2;   // seed

        int ones = 1;                  // we already have one '1' at index 0
        int i = 3;                     // next free position in s
        int idx = 0;                   // current group index in s (s[idx] tells how many)

        while (i < n) {
            int times = s[idx];        // how many times to write the next value
            int val = (s[i - 1] == 1) ? 2 : 1; // flip 1↔2

            for (int j = 0; j < times && i < n; j++) {
                s[i++] = val;
                if (val == 1) ones++;
            }
            idx++;                     // move to the next group
        }
        return ones;
    }
}
```

*Why it works* – We generate the string *on the fly* and count `1`s as soon as they appear.  
No extra pass over the data is needed.

## 2. Python 3

```python
class Solution:
    def magicalString(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        s = [1, 2, 2]            # seed of the magical string
        ones = 1                 # we already counted the leading 1
        i, idx = 3, 0            # next write position & group index

        while i < n:
            times = s[idx]       # how many times to append the opposite value
            val = 2 if s[i-1] == 1 else 1
            for _ in range(times):
                if i >= n: break
                s.append(val)
                if val == 1:
                    ones += 1
                i += 1
            idx += 1

        return ones
```

*Key points* –  
* `s` is a list of ints, not a string, so we avoid costly character concatenations.  
* The loop stops as soon as the first `n` characters are produced.

## 3. C++ 17

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int magicalString(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        vector<int> s(n);
        s[0] = 1; s[1] = 2; s[2] = 2;   // seed
        int ones = 1;                   // already counted the leading 1

        int i = 3;   // next free index
        int idx = 0; // index of the group we are reading

        while (i < n) {
            int times = s[idx];          // how many times to write the next value
            int val = (s[i-1] == 1) ? 2 : 1;

            for (int j = 0; j < times && i < n; ++j) {
                s[i++] = val;
                if (val == 1) ++ones;
            }
            ++idx;
        }
        return ones;
    }
};
```

*Notes* –  
* `vector<int>` pre‑allocates memory, keeping the runtime linear.  
* The logic is identical to Java/Python but expressed in idiomatic C++.

## 4. Blog Article – “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of LeetCode 481”

> **Title:** *Cracking LeetCode 481 – Magical String: The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly (Java, Python & C++)*

### TL;DR

- **Problem**: Count how many `1`s appear in the first `n` elements of the *magical string* that alternates 1s and 2s based on the run‑lengths of its own digits.  
- **Solution**: Generate the string in *O(n)* time, *O(n)* space, and count `1`s on the fly.  
- **Takeaway**: Avoid string concatenation, use a simple pointer system, and remember that the magical string is *self‑referential*.

---

### What is a Magical String?

A magical string `s` contains only the digits `1` and `2`.  
If you group consecutive identical digits, the *lengths* of those groups **exactly** reproduce `s`.  
For example:

```
s = 1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ...
      |  |  | | |  | |  |  |  |   |
    1  2  2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2  ...  ← run lengths
```

Thus the run‑length sequence *is* the string itself.

---

### The “Good”

1. **Linear Time** – The greedy generation visits each character once.  
   `while (i < n)` guarantees *O(n)* operations.  
2. **Simplicity** – Three indices (`i`, `idx`, and the temporary `val`) capture the whole process.  
3. **Space‑Efficient** – Only `O(n)` integers are stored, which is acceptable for the given limits (`n ≤ 100 000`).  
4. **Language‑Neutral** – The same idea works in Java, Python, and C++ without any heavy library use.

---

### The “Bad”

| Issue | Why it’s a problem | Common pitfall |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| **String concatenation** | Building `s` as a `String` or `StringBuilder` and then converting to a list of characters would double the work and slow the algorithm to *O(n²)* in the worst case. | `''.join(...)` inside a loop. |
| **Off‑by‑one bugs** | The magical string starts with `1,2,2`. Forgetting to seed these three values, or mis‑handling the indices (`i` and `idx`), will immediately break the pattern. | Initializing `i = 2` instead of `3`. |
| **Boundary checks** | Writing beyond the `n`‑th character can cause `ArrayIndexOutOfBounds` (Java/C++) or `IndexError` (Python). | Not checking `i < n` inside the inner loop. |
| **Wrong flip logic** | Assuming the next value is always `3 - s[i-1]` works only for digits `1` and `2`. | Using `s[i-1] == 1 ? 2 : 1` is clearer. |

---

### The “Ugly”

- **Hard‑coded seed** – The string always starts `122`. While correct, it feels a bit magical and makes the algorithm look less general.  
- **Large memory footprint** – For `n = 10⁵` the array consumes ~400 KB (Java) or ~400 KB (C++), which is fine, but if you were to push the limits (e.g., `n = 10⁸`), you’d need a streaming or mathematical approach.  
- **Readability vs. performance trade‑off** – Some implementations pre‑allocate a `String` buffer of length `n` and write directly, but that is less readable for newcomers.

---

### Step‑by‑Step Walkthrough

1. **Initialize**  
   ```
   s[0] = 1
   s[1] = 2
   s[2] = 2
   ones = 1          // we already counted s[0]
   i = 3             // next free index
   idx = 0           // group index
   ```

2. **Main Loop** – While we haven’t produced `n` characters:  
   *`times = s[idx]`* – how many times to write the next number.  
   *`val = (s[i-1] == 1) ? 2 : 1`* – flip between 1 and 2.  
   Append `val` `times` times (but stop if `i == n`).  
   Increment `ones` whenever `val == 1`.  
   Advance `idx`.

3. **Return** `ones`.

---

### Time & Space Complexity

| Language | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| Java | `O(n)` | `O(n)` (int array) |
| Python | `O(n)` | `O(n)` (list) |
| C++ | `O(n)` | `O(n)` (vector) |

All three implementations run comfortably under the 1‑second time limit on LeetCode’s test harness.
