        ## üöÄ Smallest Good Base ‚Äì 483 ‚Äì LeetCode  
### TL;DR  
> **Goal:** Find the smallest integer `k (k‚ÄØ‚â•‚ÄØ2)` such that the decimal number `n` can be written entirely as `111‚Ä¶1` in base‚Äë`k`.  
> **Result:** The solution runs in *O(log n)* time, easily handling `n` up to `10^18`.  

Below you‚Äôll find:

| **Java** | ‚úÖ |
| **Python** | ‚úÖ |
| **C++** | ‚úÖ |

And a full **blog‚Äëready article** that covers the *good*, *bad*, and *ugly* of the problem ‚Äì perfect for an interview prep post or a job‚Äëseeking portfolio piece.

## 1. Problem Recap

> **Given**: `n` as a decimal string (`3 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10^18`).  
> **Return**: the smallest base `k` (`k ‚â• 2`) such that  
> ```
> n = 1 + k + k^2 + ‚Ä¶ + k^(m-1)  for some integer m ‚â• 2
> ```
> i.e. the base‚Äë`k` representation of `n` is all ones.

### Examples

| `n` | base | representation | output |
|-----|------|----------------|--------|
| `13` | `3` | `111` | `"3"` |
| `4681` | `8` | `11111` | `"8"` |
| `10^18` | `10^18-1` | `11` | `"999999999999999999"` |

## 2. Intuition & Key Observations

1. **Geometric Series**  
   ```
   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ‚Ä¶ + k^(m-1) = (k^m ‚Äì 1)/(k ‚Äì 1)
   ```
   For a fixed exponent `m`, `k` satisfies a polynomial equation.

2. **Bound on `m`**  
   `k ‚â• 2` ‚Üí `k^m ‚â§ n` ‚Üí `m ‚â§ log‚ÇÇ(n)`.  
   For `n ‚â§ 10^18`, `m` never exceeds `60`. So we only need to check `m = 60 ‚Ä¶ 2`.

3. **Two Cases**  
   - **Case A**: `m > 2`.  We search for `k` by binary search between `2` and `n^(1/(m-1))`.  
   - **Case B**: `m = 2`.  Then `n = k + 1` ‚Üí `k = n ‚Äì 1`. This is the trivial ‚Äú11‚Äù representation.

4. **Overflow Safety**  
   Use `long`/`int64_t` and break early if intermediate multiplication exceeds `n`.  

---

## 3. Algorithm

```
for m from 60 down to 2:
    low = 2
    high = floor(n^(1/(m-1))) + 1   // +1 to cover rounding errors
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        val = 1
        for i in 1 ‚Ä¶ m-1:
            val *= mid
            if val > n: break
        if val == n:
            return mid
        else if val < n:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
return n - 1   // the ‚Äú11‚Äù case
```

The algorithm is **O(log n)**:  
- We try at most 59 exponents (`m`).  
- For each exponent we perform a binary search over `k` (‚âà log‚ÇÇ n iterations).  
- The inner loop runs at most `m` times, but `m` is ‚â§ 60, so it is constant.

            long low = 2;
            // high ‚âà n^(1/(m-1))  -> use double for initial estimate
            long high = (long)Math.pow(n, 1.0 / (m - 1)) + 1;
            while (low <= high) {

### 5.1 Introduction

If you‚Äôve ever stared at the ‚ÄúSmallest Good Base‚Äù problem on LeetCode, you know it‚Äôs a *real* interview‚Äëstyle puzzle. It forces you to think beyond brute force, to see the math that hides in the digits, and to write clean, production‚Äëready code in any of the three most popular languages: Java, Python, or C++.  

This article walks you through the **good** (understanding the math), the **bad** (common pitfalls and over‚Äëengineering), and the **ugly** (performance hacks you should avoid). By the end, you‚Äôll have a polished solution you can proudly drop into your GitHub portfolio and explain in a hiring interview.

---

### 5.2 The Good ‚Äì Why It‚Äôs a Great Interview Question

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Mathematics + Algorithms** | Leverages number theory (geometric series) and algorithm design (binary search). |
| **Scalable Constraints** | Handles `n` up to `10^18`‚Äîforces careful overflow handling and efficient loops. |
| **Language Agnostic** | Solvable in Java, Python, C++ ‚Üí shows your cross‚Äëplatform thinking. |
| **Real‚ÄëWorld Relevance** | Searching for a base is analogous to optimizing data representation, a common systems problem. |

### 5.3 The Bad ‚Äì Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact | How to Avoid |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| **Full brute‚Äëforce** (loop over every base up to n) | `O(n)` ‚Üí 10¬π‚Å∏ iterations ‚Üí impossible. | Use the geometric‚Äëseries bound to reduce `m` to ‚â§60. |
| **Relying on floating‚Äëpoint for power calculation** | Rounding errors can miss the correct base. | Add a safety margin (`+1`) and confirm with integer arithmetic. |
| **Ignoring overflow** | `k^m` quickly overflows 64‚Äëbit, leading to wrong comparisons. | Break early when multiplication exceeds `n`; use 128‚Äëbit integers where available. |
| **Treating `m=2` the same as others** | The ‚Äú11‚Äù case (base `n‚Äë1`) is trivial but often forgotten. | After loop, return `n-1` as fallback. |

### 5.4 The Ugly ‚Äì Performance Hacks You Should Not Use

- **Pre‚Äëcomputing powers with `Math.pow`**: It‚Äôs fast but double‚Äëprecision loses precision for large exponents.
- **Heavy use of BigInteger/BigInt**: Works, but the constant factor is huge and slows Java/Python.
- **Recursive exponentiation without memoization**: Adds recursion depth overhead.

The sweet spot is **binary search + careful multiplication**, as shown in the code snippets. It gives you `O(log n)` time and constant memory.

### 5.6 TL;DR Checklist for Interviewers

1. **Ask** if you can derive the formula `n = (k^m - 1) / (k - 1)`.  
2. **Check** your bound on `m` (`‚â§ log‚ÇÇ n`).  
3. **Expect** a binary search over `k`.  
4. **Look for** overflow handling (early break).  
5. **Confirm** the special case `m=2` ‚Üí `k = n-1`.

If you can walk through these steps smoothly, you‚Äôll impress any hiring manager.
