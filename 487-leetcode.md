## 👋 Introduction

If you’re preparing for a software‑engineering interview, you’ll have run into LeetCode’s “Max Consecutive Ones II” (Problem 487) at least once. It’s a classic sliding‑window challenge that tests your ability to think in linear time while handling a *single* allowed “flip” of a 0 to a 1.

Below you’ll find:

| Language | File name | Complexity |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Java** | `Solution.java` | **O(n)** time, **O(1)** space |
| **Python** | `solution.py` | **O(n)** time, **O(1)** space |
| **C++** | `solution.cpp` | **O(n)** time, **O(1)** space |

And then a deep‑dive blog post that covers *the good, the bad, and the ugly* of this problem – all the while sprinkled with SEO‑friendly content to help you land that interview.

## 🔧 1. Code Solutions

### 1.1 Java

```java
// Solution.java
public class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int maxLen = 0;        // longest sequence found so far
        int left   = 0;        // left bound of the sliding window
        int zeroes = 0;        // number of zeros in the current window

        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            // Expand the window by adding the rightmost element
            if (nums[right] == 0) zeroes++;

            // If we have more than one zero, shrink from the left
            while (zeroes > 1) {
                if (nums[left] == 0) zeroes--;
                left++;
            }

            // Update the best answer
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

### 1.2 Python 3

```python
# solution.py
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max_len = 0
        left = 0
        zeroes = 0

        for right, val in enumerate(nums):
            if val == 0:
                zeroes += 1

            while zeroes > 1:
                if nums[left] == 0:
                    zeroes -= 1
                left += 1

            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

        return max_len
```

### 1.3 C++

```cpp
// solution.cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxLen = 0, left = 0, zeroes = 0;
        for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); ++right) {
            if (nums[right] == 0) ++zeroes;

            while (zeroes > 1) {
                if (nums[left] == 0) --zeroes;
                ++left;
            }
            maxLen = max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
};
```

## 📚 2. The Blog Article – “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly”

> *Why this article?*  
> If you’re looking to **boost your resume** and impress hiring managers, writing a blog post like this demonstrates depth, communication skills, and real‑world problem‑solving—all the traits recruiters love.

> *How does SEO help?*  
> By using keywords such as *“LeetCode 487”*, *“Max Consecutive Ones II”*, *“interview coding”*, and *“sliding window algorithm”*, the article is more likely to surface in searches by hiring managers, recruiters, or fellow candidates preparing for interviews.

### 2.1 Problem Statement (LeetCode 487)

> **Given** a binary array `nums`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`s in the array if you can flip at most one `0`.  
> **Example**  
> ```text
> Input:  [1,0,1,1,0]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: Flip the first 0 → [1,1,1,1,0]
> ```
> **Constraints**  
> * 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁵  
> * nums[i] is either 0 or 1

### 2.2 Why It Matters in Interviews

* **Algorithmic thinking** – Recognizes the classic *sliding window* pattern.  
* **Space optimization** – Highlights how to achieve O(1) memory.  
* **Edge‑case handling** – Handles arrays full of `1`s, all `0`s, or a single element.  

Hiring managers value candidates who can translate a problem description into an efficient, clean solution.

### 2.3 The Good – Sliding Window, O(n) Time

- **Intuition** – Keep a window `[left, right]` that contains at most one `0`.  
- **Why O(n)?**  
  *Each index is visited at most twice:* once when `right` expands, once when `left` contracts.  
- **Space O(1)** – Only counters and pointers.

> *Tip:* In interview, explain the invariants:  
> “The window always holds ≤1 zero. If adding a new element would create a second zero, we slide left until the zero count drops back to 1.”

---

### 2.4 The Bad – Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Explanation | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Off‑by‑one in window length | Using `right - left` instead of `right - left + 1` | Add +1 |
| Forgetting to shrink on the *first* zero | When the first zero appears, we still allow it, but adding a second zero breaks the rule | Use a `while (zeroes > 1)` guard |
| Using `for (int left = 0; left < n; ++left)` | Wrong: we need to contract *inside* the loop, not a separate outer loop | Keep `left` as a moving pointer |

These mistakes often cause time‑limit exceeded (TLE) or wrong answer (WA) in coding platforms.

---

### 2.5 The Ugly – Infinite Stream Variant

**Follow‑up Question**: *“What if the numbers come as an infinite stream? You cannot store all elements.”*

**Solution** – Maintain:

1. `lastZeroIdx` – index of the most recent zero.  
2. `countOnes` – number of consecutive ones seen so far.  
3. `maxLen` – best answer.

When a new `1` arrives, increment `countOnes`.  
When a `0` arrives, update `maxLen` using the distance from `lastZeroIdx` to the current index, then set `lastZeroIdx` to current index and reset `countOnes`.

**Pseudo‑code**:

```text
maxLen = 0
lastZeroIdx = -1
currentLen = 0

for each incoming bit b at position i:
    if b == 1:
        currentLen += 1
    else: // b == 0
        maxLen = max(maxLen, i - lastZeroIdx)   // flip this zero
        lastZeroIdx = i
        currentLen = 0

// After stream ends (if it does)
maxLen = max(maxLen, currentLen)
```

This runs in **O(1)** space and processes each element in **O(1)** time – perfect for streaming data.

### 2.6 Complexity Summary

| Approach | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| Sliding Window (Array) | **O(n)** | **O(1)** |
| DP/Prefix‑Sum | O(n) | O(n) |
| Infinite Stream | O(1) per element | **O(1)** |

### 2.7 Interview Tips

| Tip | Rationale |
|-----|-----------|
| **Explain the invariant** | Shows you understand why the algorithm works. |
| **Talk about edge cases** | Recruiters test candidates on 0‑length, all‑ones, all‑zeros arrays. |
| **Mention time/space trade‑offs** | Demonstrates awareness of efficiency. |
| **Write clean, commented code** | Improves readability and demonstrates professionalism. |
| **Show the infinite‑stream idea** | Even if the interview only asks for the array case, presenting the streaming variant showcases creativity. |
