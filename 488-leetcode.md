        ## 1. 3‑Language Implementation for Leetcode 488 – “Zuma Game”

Below you’ll find a **DFS + memoization** solution (the canonical way to solve this hard problem) in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.  
Each implementation follows the same logic:

1. **State** – A pair `(boardString, handCounts)`  
   * `boardString` is the current board (after all chain reactions).  
   * `handCounts` is a 5‑element array (`R,Y,B,G,W`) counting how many balls of each colour remain in the hand.

2. **Memoization** – Store the minimum insertions required to clear a state in a map (`HashMap` / `unordered_map` / `dict`).  
   The state key is a string representation of the board plus the hand counts.

3. **Recursive DFS** –  
   * If the board is empty → 0 moves needed.  
   * If the hand is empty and board is not → return `INF`.  
   * For every colour that still has a ball in hand, try inserting it at every **possible “gap”** between groups of the same colour (inserting elsewhere can’t create a new group).  
   * After insertion, perform the *collapse* (remove consecutive groups of ≥3).  
   * Recurse on the new state, add 1 for the insertion, and keep the minimum over all possibilities.

The algorithm is exponential in the worst case, but with the board length ≤ 16 and hand length ≤ 5, memoization keeps it well within the limits.

## 2.  Blog Article – “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of Leetcode 488”

### Introduction

In the world of coding interviews, a single problem can decide your fate. **Leetcode 488 – Zuma Game** is one of those hard questions that tests not only your data‑structure knowledge but also your ability to think recursively and optimise a brute‑force search. In this article, we’ll dissect the problem, explore why naïve approaches fail, present a clean DFS‑with‑memo solution (in Java, Python, and C++), and give you a cheat‑sheet for interview success.

---

### The Good – What Makes Zuma Game Manageable

1. **Small Input Size**  
   * Board length ≤ 16, hand length ≤ 5.  
   * These constraints allow exponential solutions if we prune wisely.

2. **Well‑Defined State Space**  
   * A state is fully described by the current board string and the remaining ball counts.  
   * The board string never contains a group of 3+, so its length shrinks rapidly during recursion.

3. **Deterministic Collapse Rule**  
   * After each insertion the board collapses deterministically.  
   * No branching comes from the collapse itself, only from the insertion points.

4. **Memoization Wins**  
   * Many different insertion sequences lead to the same `(board, hand)` pair.  
   * Storing results eliminates repeated work and keeps the runtime practical.

---

### The Bad – Why Brute‑Force Fails

- **Exponential Explosion**:  
  In the worst case, each of the 5 hand balls could be inserted at any of ~16 positions, leading to `O(5^16)` possibilities.

- **Redundant Work**:  
  Two completely different sequences can result in the exact same board and hand state. Without caching, we recompute the same subproblem dozens of times.

- **Unnecessary Insertion Positions**:  
  Inserting a ball where it cannot possibly create a group is wasted effort. A naïve algorithm blindly tries all positions, wasting time on futile paths.

---

### The Ugly – Subtleties That Trip Many Interviewees

1. **Choosing the Right Insertion Points**  
   * You can insert a ball only *between* a pair of the same colour or at the ends.  
   * Missing this optimisation results in unnecessary recursion depth.

2. **Backtracking with Mutable State**  
   * In languages like Java or C++ where arrays or maps are mutated in place, forgetting to backtrack causes subtle bugs.

3. **Hashing the Hand**  
   * A naïve string concatenation can be slow.  
   * Compacting the hand counts into a fixed‑length string (e.g., “21004#”) saves both time and memory.

4. **Collapse Implementation**  
   * The collapse is often written as a loop over the string.  
   * A buggy collapse that misses cascaded removals can lead to infinite recursion or incorrect answers.

---

### The Ugly – Common Pitfalls in Interview Coding

- **Ignoring the “Only Same‑Colour” Rule**:  
  Interviewers expect you to prune positions that can’t create a group. Failing to do so often results in time‑outs.

- **Over‑Simplifying the State**:  
  Using just the board string for memoization (ignoring hand counts) leads to wrong answers because the same board can be reachable with different hand resources.

- **Recursive Stack Overflows**:  
  In languages without automatic tail‑call optimisation, deep recursion may exceed the stack. The provided implementations keep the depth < 16, so they are safe, but always mention “I’d guard against stack overflows in production code”.

---

### The Clean Solution – DFS + Memoisation

#### 1. Recursion + Collapse

We recursively try every *valid* insertion, collapse the board, and call the helper again. The base case is a cleared board.

#### 2. Pruning the Insertion Positions

```text
if (pos > 0 && board[pos-1] != c) continue;   // not the same colour on the left
if (pos < board.size() && board[pos] != c) continue; // not same colour on the right
```

Only these positions can potentially create a group of 3+ and thus change the board.

#### 3. Memoisation Key

`board + "#" + handCounts` (or a tuple/array in Python/C++).  
Storing the best result for this key guarantees **O(number of unique states)** runtime.

#### 4. Collapse Function

A simple loop that deletes any run of 3+ until none remain.  
Because the board shrinks after each collapse, the recursion quickly bottoms out.

### Interview Cheat‑Sheet

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| *Why did you use DFS instead of BFS?* | DFS matches the problem’s recursive nature; we only need the minimal number of steps, not the exact sequence. |
| *How do you avoid exploring the same state twice?* | I use memoisation (`@lru_cache` in Python, `unordered_map` in C++, `lru_cache`‑style map in Java). |
| *What is the worst‑case time complexity?* | With pruning and memoisation it is roughly `O(2^n * 5^k)`, but in practice it runs in < 1 s on Leetcode’s server due to state pruning. |
| *Can you explain the collapse rule in O(n)?* | We scan the board left‑to‑right, delete any group of 3+ immediately, then restart. This is O(length of board) per collapse. |
| *Why do you check only positions adjacent to same‑colour groups?* | Inserting elsewhere can’t reduce the board; it would create a new isolated ball that can never collapse, so it’s wasted effort. |

---

### Code‑Ready Cheat‑Sheet

| Language | Key Functions |
|----------|---------------|
| **Java** | `dfs(board, handCnt)`, `collapse(String)`, `encode(handCnt)` |
| **Python** | `dfs(cur_board, hand_tuple)` with `@lru_cache`, `collapse(s)` |
| **C++** | `dfs(board, hand, memo)`, `collapse(s)` |

> **Tip:** Bring these implementations on a whiteboard – a polished code snippet with clear comments impresses interviewers and shows you truly *understand* the algorithm.

### Final Thoughts

Leetcode 488 is a beautiful example of how constraints can turn an otherwise impossible problem into a solvable one. Master the DFS‑with‑memo pattern, practice the collapse logic, and you’ll feel confident tackling any hard interview question that comes your way.
