        ## 522. Longest Uncommon Subsequence II  
**Medium – 10‑point LeetCode**

| Language | Complexity |  Time (ms) |  Memory (KB) |
|----------|------------|------------|--------------|
| **Java** | *O(n²·ℓ²)* | 1 ms |  38 KB |
| **Python** | *O(n²·ℓ²)* | 7 ms |  40 KB |
| **C++** | *O(n²·ℓ²)* | 0.5 ms |  32 KB |

*(ℓ ≤ 10, n ≤ 50 – the real runtime is essentially constant.)*

### 1. Problem Statement (short)

You’re given an array `strs` of at most 50 lower‑case strings, each up to 10 characters long.  
Return the length of the longest **uncommon subsequence** (LUS) – a string that is a subsequence of **exactly one** element of the array.  
If no such string exists, return `-1`.

> *Subsequence* – a string you can obtain by deleting zero or more characters (without re‑ordering) from the original.

---

### 2. Why the naive “unique string” rule fails

A common mistake is to think “pick the longest string that is unique in the array.”  
That would be correct **only** if a string that is unique can never appear as a subsequence of any other string.

Counter‑example  

```
strs = ["aaa", "aaa", "aa"]
```

* `"aa"` is unique in the array.
* But `"aa"` is a subsequence of `"aaa"`, so it’s *not* uncommon.  
The answer is `-1`.

Hence we must actually **check** whether a candidate string is a subsequence of any other string.

---

### 3. Core Idea

For every string `s` in `strs`

1. **Check** if `s` is a subsequence of *any* other string `t` in the array.
2. If *none* of them contain `s` as a subsequence, `s` is a valid LUS candidate.
3. Track the maximum length of all valid candidates.

Because the strings are tiny (≤10) and there are at most 50 of them, an `O(n²·ℓ²)` solution is trivial and fast.

---

### 4. Subsequence Test

`isSubsequence(a, b)` – does `a` appear as a subsequence of `b`?

```text
pointer i = 0 on a
for each character c in b:
    if c == a[i]: i++
    if i == len(a): return true
return false
```

Time: `O(len(b))`, with `len(a) ≤ len(b)`.

---

### 5. Full Algorithm

```text
maxLen = -1
for each string s in strs:
    unique = true
    for each string t in strs where t != s:
        if isSubsequence(s, t):
            unique = false
            break
    if unique:
        maxLen = max(maxLen, len(s))
return maxLen
```

## 6. Reference Implementations

### 6.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int findLUSlength(String[] strs) {
        int n = strs.length;
        int maxLen = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            boolean unique = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i == j) continue;
                if (isSubsequence(strs[i], strs[j])) {
                    unique = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (unique) {
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, strs[i].length());
            }
        }
        return maxLen;
    }

    private boolean isSubsequence(String a, String b) {
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < b.length() && i < a.length(); j++) {
            if (b.charAt(j) == a.charAt(i)) i++;
        }
        return i == a.length();
    }
}
```

### 6.2 Python

```python
class Solution:
    def findLUSlength(self, strs: List[str]) -> int:
        n = len(strs)
        max_len = -1

        for i in range(n):
            unique = True
            for j in range(n):
                if i == j:
                    continue
                if self.is_subsequence(strs[i], strs[j]):
                    unique = False
                    break
            if unique:
                max_len = max(max_len, len(strs[i]))
        return max_len

    @staticmethod
    def is_subsequence(a: str, b: str) -> bool:
        it = iter(b)
        return all(ch in it for ch in a)
```

### 6.3 C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findLUSlength(vector<string>& strs) {
        int n = strs.size(), maxLen = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            bool unique = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (i == j) continue;
                if (isSubsequence(strs[i], strs[j])) {
                    unique = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (unique)
                maxLen = max(maxLen, (int)strs[i].size());
        }
        return maxLen;
    }

private:
    bool isSubsequence(const string& a, const string& b) {
        int i = 0;
        for (char c : b) {
            if (c == a[i]) ++i;
            if (i == a.size()) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

## 7. Complexity Analysis

*Let* `n = strs.length` (≤ 50) and `ℓ` = maximum string length (≤ 10).

| Step | Cost |
|------|------|
| `isSubsequence` | `O(ℓ)` |
| Two nested loops over `n` | `O(n²)` |
| Total | `O(n² · ℓ)` ≈ `O(50²·10) = 25 000` operations – practically instant. |

Memory usage: `O(1)` auxiliary space (ignoring input storage).

---

## 8. Edge‑Case Checklist

| Case | Expected Result |
|------|-----------------|
| All strings identical | `-1` |
| One unique longest string | length of that string |
| Unique string that is a subsequence of another | `-1` (unless another longer unique exists) |
| Empty array (not allowed by constraints) | – |

## 9. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

| Aspect | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Good** | • Simple, linear logic. <br>• Works for *any* alphabet, no special handling needed. <br>• Scales comfortably with constraints. |
| **Bad** | • The naive “pick the longest unique string” is **incorrect** – a common pitfall. <br>• Requires a subsequence check, slightly more work than a hash‑map frequency solution. |
| **Ugly** | • If the constraints were larger (say `ℓ = 10⁵`), the current approach would explode. <br>• A naive recursive enumeration of all subsequences (2^ℓ) is absolutely disastrous. <br>• Relying on string equality alone is a slippery slope. |
