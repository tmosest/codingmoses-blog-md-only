        ## 1.  Problem Recap – LeetCode 522: **Longest Uncommon Subsequence II**

Given an array of strings `strs`, we must find the length of the **longest uncommon subsequence** among them.  
An *uncommon subsequence* is a string that is a subsequence of **one** string in the array but **not** a subsequence of **any** of the other strings.  
If no such subsequence exists, return `-1`.

> **Examples**  
> *Input:* `["aba","cdc","eae"]` → **Output:** `3`  
> *Input:* `["aaa","aaa","aa"]` → **Output:** `-1`

### Constraints
- `2 ≤ strs.length ≤ 50`
- `1 ≤ strs[i].length ≤ 10`
- All strings contain only lowercase English letters

---

## 2.  Core Insight

If a string appears **more than once** in the array, it cannot be the longest uncommon subsequence – it is a subsequence of the other identical string(s).  
Conversely, if a string appears **exactly once**, it is a subsequence of itself and **cannot** be a subsequence of any *other* string that has a *different* value, because the other string differs in at least one character.  
Hence, the longest uncommon subsequence is simply the **longest string that appears only once**.

So the algorithm reduces to:

1. Count how many times each string appears.
2. Among the strings that appear only once, pick the maximum length.
3. If no such string exists, return `-1`.

This is a **O(n · m)** solution where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the average length – easily fast enough for the given limits.

## 3.  Code Implementations

Below are clean, production‑ready implementations in **Java, Python, and C++**.  
All three use the same logic described above.

### 3.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    /**
     * Returns the length of the longest uncommon subsequence or -1 if none exists.
     *
     * @param strs array of lowercase strings
     * @return length of longest uncommon subsequence or -1
     */
    public int findLUSlength(String[] strs) {
        // Count frequency of each string
        Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        for (String s : strs) {
            freq.put(s, freq.getOrDefault(s, 0) + 1);
        }

        int longest = -1;
        for (String s : strs) {
            if (freq.get(s) == 1) {          // appears only once
                longest = Math.max(longest, s.length());
            }
        }
        return longest;
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Python

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findLUSlength(self, strs: List[str]) -> int:
        """Return length of longest uncommon subsequence or -1."""
        freq = Counter(strs)
        longest = -1
        for s in strs:
            if freq[s] == 1:                # unique string
                longest = max(longest, len(s))
        return longest
```

### 3.3 C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findLUSlength(vector<string>& strs) {
        unordered_map<string, int> freq;
        for (const auto& s : strs)
            ++freq[s];

        int longest = -1;
        for (const auto& s : strs) {
            if (freq[s] == 1)              // unique string
                longest = max<longest>(longest, static_cast<int>(s.size()));
        }
        return longest;
    }
};
```

All three solutions are **O(n · m)** time and **O(n)** auxiliary space.

## 4.  “Good, Bad, & Ugly” – Deep Dive

| Aspect | What’s Good | What’s Bad | What’s Ugly |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Time Complexity** | Linear‑time, fast even for the upper limit of 50 strings. | None | – |
| **Space Complexity** | Only a frequency map – negligible. | None | – |
| **Simplicity** | One pass to build a map, another pass to find the max. | None | – |
| **Edge Cases Handled** | Empty array (not allowed by constraints), duplicates, single‑char strings. | None | – |
| **Scalability** | Works for any realistic `n`, `m`. | If `m` were huge (e.g., 10⁶), the map keys would explode. | – |
| **Brute‑Force Ugly** | Avoided – no `2^m` enumeration of subsequences. | N/A | Brute‑force would be `O(n · 2^m)` and impossible for `m = 10`. |

### Why the “ugly” brute‑force is rarely needed
For very short strings (`m ≤ 10`) a brute‑force DFS or bit‑mask enumeration would still run fast, but it is far less elegant and harder to maintain. The greedy frequency‑count solution is *not* only faster, it is also clearer for interviewers to evaluate.

### 5.1 Article Body

> **Introduction**  
> The “Longest Uncommon Subsequence II” problem is a popular LeetCode interview question (Problem 522). It tests your understanding of subsequences, string manipulation, and clever greedy reasoning. In this article, we’ll walk through an optimal solution, present clean code in three major languages, and analyze the algorithm’s strengths and pitfalls.

> **Problem Overview**  
> You’re given an array of strings, and you need to find the length of the longest string that is a subsequence of **exactly one** string in the array. If no such string exists, return `-1`. The constraints are modest (`n ≤ 50`, `m ≤ 10`), but the key is to avoid brute‑force enumeration of all subsequences.

> **Key Insight – The Frequency Trick**  
> A string that appears multiple times can never be an uncommon subsequence because it will match every identical occurrence. Conversely, a unique string can’t be a subsequence of another different string because the two differ in at least one character. Thus, the answer is simply the longest **unique** string in the array.

> **Algorithm Steps**  
> 1. Count the frequency of each string using a hash map.  
> 2. Iterate again and keep track of the maximum length among strings with frequency = 1.  
> 3. Return that maximum or `-1` if none were found.

> **Complexity**  
> *Time*: O(n · m) – one pass to build the map, another to find the maximum.  
> *Space*: O(n) – the map stores at most `n` entries.

> **Code Implementations**  
> *Java*: [Link to snippet]  
> *Python*: [Link to snippet]  
> *C++*: [Link to snippet]  

> **“Good, Bad, Ugly” Analysis**  
> *Good*: Linear time, minimal memory, easy to read.  
> *Bad*: Assumes that all strings are distinct; if the dataset were huge, hash‑key storage could become a bottleneck (not a concern for LeetCode limits).  
> *Ugly*: A brute‑force DFS would generate 2^m subsequences per string—impractical for `m = 10` and far more verbose.

> **Takeaway for Interviews**  
> The interviewer is looking for two things: correctness and an efficient idea. The frequency‑based greedy solution demonstrates both. If you can explain why a unique string cannot be a subsequence of another different string, you’ll impress any hiring manager.

> **Further Practice**  
> 1. *Longest Common Subsequence* – the counterpart problem.  
> 2. *Longest Repeating Substring* – similar hashing technique.  
> 3. *String Subsequence DP* – for deeper DP practice.

> **Conclusion**  
> Problem 522 is a classic “look‑for‑patterns” question. By focusing on frequency, we bypass unnecessary complexity and produce code that is both fast and easy to maintain. Master this pattern, and you’ll be ready for any string‑based interview question.
