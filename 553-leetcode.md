        ## üöÄ Optimal Division ‚Äì LeetCode¬†553  
*The One‚Äëliner Greedy that Every Interviewer Loves*  

---

### TL;DR
- **Problem** ‚Äì Given an array `nums`, insert parentheses in `nums[0]/nums[1]/‚Ä¶/nums[n‚Äë1]` so the result is maximum.  
- **Insight** ‚Äì For `n ‚â• 3` the best expression is  
  `nums[0] / (nums[1] / nums[2] / ‚Ä¶ / nums[n‚Äë1])`  
  (i.e. the first number divided by the *product* of all the rest).  
- **Why it works** ‚Äì All numbers are ‚â•‚ÄØ2, so you want to divide the first number by the *smallest* possible denominator.  
  Placing the rest in a chain of divisions inside one big set of parentheses turns the whole tail into a single number equal to the product of the tail.  
- **Complexity** ‚Äì O(n) time, O(1) extra space.

> **Result** ‚Äì For any input `[a,b,c,‚Ä¶]`  
> `n==1 ‚Üí "a"`  
> `n==2 ‚Üí "a/b"`  
> `n‚â•3 ‚Üí "a/(b/c/.../z)"`

Below you‚Äôll find clean, production‚Äëready implementations in **Java, Python, and C++**, followed by a short SEO‚Äëfriendly blog post that explains the algorithm and showcases how to ace your next interview.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public String optimalDivision(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n == 1) return Integer.toString(nums[0]);

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(Integer.toString(nums[0]));
        if (n == 2) {
            sb.append("/").append(nums[1]);
        } else {
            sb.append("/(");
            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                sb.append(nums[i]);
                if (i < n - 1) sb.append("/");
            }
            sb.append(")");
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Python

```python
class Solution:
    def optimalDivision(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
        n = len(nums)
        if n == 1:
            return str(nums[0])
        if n == 2:
            return f"{nums[0]}/{nums[1]}"
        # n >= 3
        tail = "/".join(map(str, nums[1:]))
        return f"{nums[0]}/({tail})"
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string optimalDivision(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 1) return to_string(nums[0]);

        ostringstream oss;
        oss << nums[0];
        if (n == 2) {
            oss << '/' << nums[1];
        } else {
            oss << "/(";
            for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
                oss << nums[i];
                if (i < n - 1) oss << '/';
            }
            oss << ')';
        }
        return oss.str();
    }
};
```

> **Note:** All three solutions run in **O(n)** time, use **O(1)** additional memory, and output a string without redundant parentheses ‚Äì exactly what the problem asks for.

### 1. Introduction

When you‚Äôre staring at a LeetCode challenge that looks like a maze of parentheses, the first instinct is to brute‚Äëforce or DP. But sometimes the trick is to look at the **structure of the operations** and spot a pattern.  

LeetCode 553 ‚ÄúOptimal Division‚Äù is a classic example:  
> *Given an integer array `nums`, insert parentheses in the expression `nums[0]/nums[1]/‚Ä¶/nums[n‚Äë1]` so the result is maximized.*

You might think you need to explore all binary tree structures. In fact, the **optimal solution is a single greedy rule** that gives the answer in O(n) time.

### 2. The Good ‚Äì A Beautiful Greedy Insight

| Step | Why it‚Äôs good |
|------|---------------|
| **1. Observe that all `nums[i] ‚â• 2`** | The more you divide a number by another number > 1, the smaller the result becomes. |
| **2. The first number should stay on the ‚Äúoutside‚Äù** | We want the numerator as large as possible. |
| **3. All remaining numbers should be inside one big denominator** | By grouping `nums[1], ‚Ä¶, nums[n-1]` as `nums[1]/nums[2]/‚Ä¶/nums[n-1]`, we effectively turn the whole tail into a *single* number equal to the product of the tail (`nums[1] * nums[2] * ‚Ä¶ * nums[n-1]`). The division chain inside the parentheses evaluates to that product. |
| **4. Result** | For `n‚â•3`: `nums[0] / (nums[1] / nums[2] / ‚Ä¶ / nums[n-1])`. For `n==1,2`, just return the obvious expression. |

> **Why this gives the maximum**  
> The denominator is minimized when the entire tail is treated as a single number. Any other placement of parentheses would create intermediate divisions that **reduce** the denominator, yielding a *smaller* overall value.

### 3. The Bad ‚Äì Why You Might Overthink

1. **Dynamic Programming** ‚Äì Some solutions try to DP over every possible split, which is unnecessary and over‚Äëengineering.  
2. **Parsing / Evaluation** ‚Äì Writing a full parser to evaluate each expression is both slow and error‚Äëprone.  
3. **Redundant Parentheses** ‚Äì Adding parentheses blindly can result in outputs like `1000/((100/10)/2)`. The problem explicitly forbids redundant parentheses, so you must produce a concise form.

These pitfalls distract from the key insight: *the tail should always be fully parenthesized as one group.*

---

### 4. The Ugly ‚Äì Edge Cases & Implementation Traps

| Edge | Tricky Point | Fix |
|------|--------------|-----|
| `nums.length == 1` | No division needed | Return the number as a string |
| `nums.length == 2` | Simple division | Return `"a/b"` |
| `nums.length >= 3` | Forgetting parentheses or missing slashes | Build the string carefully; use a loop to append `"/"` only between elements, not after the last one |
| Large input (`n==10`) | Even though `O(n)` is trivial, avoid building many temporary strings ‚Äì use `StringBuilder`/`ostringstream`/`stringstream` |

---

### 5. Interview Tips

1. **Explain the intuition first** ‚Äì Show that the numerator should stay as large as possible and that the rest should form a product.  
2. **Show the final formula** ‚Äì Write it out: `nums[0] / (nums[1] / nums[2] / ‚Ä¶ / nums[n-1])`.  
3. **Edge‚Äëcase handling** ‚Äì Mention the 1‚Äë and 2‚Äëelement arrays.  
4. **Time / Space Complexity** ‚Äì O(n) time, O(1) space.  
5. **Why no DP** ‚Äì Mention that all numbers are > 1, so you don't need to consider multiple splits.  

> This concise, mathematically‚Äëgrounded answer usually impresses interviewers because it demonstrates clarity of thought and algorithmic efficiency.

### 6. Code Review ‚Äì Java, Python, C++

> **Java**  
> ```java
> public class Solution {
>     public String optimalDivision(int[] nums) { ‚Ä¶ }
> }
> ```
>  
> **Python**  
> ```python
> class Solution:
>     def optimalDivision(self, nums: List[int]) -> str: ‚Ä¶
> ```
>  
> **C++**  
> ```cpp
> class Solution {
> public:
>     string optimalDivision(vector<int>& nums) { ‚Ä¶ }
> };
> ```

All three are **short, readable, and production‚Äëready**. They use simple loops, no recursion, and avoid unnecessary temporary objects.

### 8. Closing Thoughts

LeetCode 553 is a textbook example of how a deep understanding of the *problem domain* can turn a seemingly complex combinatorial challenge into a one‚Äëliner. By keeping the numerator untouched and letting the rest form a single denominator, you guarantee the maximum result.  

**Remember**: Before you dive into brute force or DP, always analyze the constraints and the operation‚Äôs mathematical properties. It saves time, simplifies code, and impresses interviewers.

Good luck, and happy coding! üöÄ
