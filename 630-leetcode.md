## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Recap

> **Course Schedule III**  
> You‚Äôre given `n` courses, each represented by `[duration, lastDay]`.  
> You start on day `1`, can take only one course at a time, and must finish a course on or before its `lastDay`.  
> **Return the maximum number of courses you can finish.**

| Constraints |
|-------------|
| `1 <= courses.length <= 10‚Å¥` |
| `1 <= duration, lastDay <= 10‚Å¥` |

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ The ‚ÄúGood‚Äù ‚Äì Optimal Strategy

The optimal greedy strategy is:

1. **Sort** courses by their deadline (`lastDay`) in ascending order.  
2. **Iterate** through the sorted list.  
3. Keep a **max‚Äëheap** (priority queue) of the durations of the courses we have already taken.  
4. **Keep a running total** `time` of days spent so far.  
5. For each course `c`:
   * If `time + c.duration <= c.lastDay` ‚Üí take it, add its duration to the heap and increment `time`.
   * Else, if the longest course in the heap is longer than `c.duration`, replace it:
     * `time = time - longest + c.duration`
     * Replace in heap (`poll()` the longest, then `offer(c.duration)`).
6. The size of the heap at the end is the answer.

**Why does it work?**  
Sorting by deadline guarantees that we never violate a stricter deadline.  
Whenever a new course cannot be added, we try to *swap* the longest existing course for the shorter one ‚Äì this strictly reduces the total time while keeping the same number of courses. If no swap can help, no future schedule can contain this course without violating its deadline.

**Complexities**

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Sorting | `O(n log n)` | `O(1)` |
| Each course processing | `O(log n)` (heap ops) | `O(n)` (heap) |
| **Overall** | `O(n log n)` | `O(n)` |

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ The ‚ÄúBad‚Äù ‚Äì Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why it fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Using a min‚Äëheap** for durations | Removing the *shortest* duration might increase total time | Use a *max‚Äëheap* instead |
| **Skipping sorting** | Deadlines may be out of order ‚Üí you might miss a feasible schedule | Always sort by `lastDay` |
| **Not swapping when possible** | You may incorrectly discard a shorter course | Replace longest in heap only when it‚Äôs longer than the current course |
| **Overflow** | Summing durations up to `10‚Å¥ * 10‚Å¥ = 10‚Å∏` fits in `int`, but use `long` for safety in Java/C++ | Store `time` as `long` |
| **Assuming all courses fit** | Some courses may have `lastDay` earlier than `duration` ‚Üí skip them | The algorithm handles this automatically (condition fails) |

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ The ‚ÄúUgly‚Äù ‚Äì Edge Cases & Variations

1. **Zero‚Äëduration courses** ‚Äì not allowed by constraints but if they appear, they can be taken anytime.  
2. **Tight deadlines** ‚Äì if many courses share the same `lastDay`, sorting keeps a deterministic order but the greedy still works.  
3. **Large input** ‚Äì ensure your heap implementation is efficient; Java‚Äôs `PriorityQueue`, Python‚Äôs `heapq` (with negative values for max‚Äëheap), and C++‚Äôs `priority_queue` are fine.  
4. **Multiple identical courses** ‚Äì duplicates don‚Äôt affect correctness; they‚Äôre treated individually.  
5. **Memory‚Äëlimited environments** ‚Äì you can keep the heap size at most `n`, but if `n` is very large, consider streaming or external sorting.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Code Snippets

Below are clean, ready‚Äëto‚Äëcopy implementations in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.

### 5.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int scheduleCourse(int[][] courses) {
        // Sort by deadline
        Arrays.sort(courses, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));

        // Max-heap for durations
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        long time = 0;

        for (int[] course : courses) {
            int dur = course[0];
            int last = course[1];

            if (time + dur <= last) {
                maxHeap.offer(dur);
                time += dur;
            } else if (!maxHeap.isEmpty() && maxHeap.peek() > dur) {
                time += dur - maxHeap.poll();
                maxHeap.offer(dur);
            }
        }
        return maxHeap.size();
    }
}
```

> **Complexity**: `O(n log n)` time, `O(n)` space.

---

### 5.2 Python

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def scheduleCourse(self, courses: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Sort by lastDay
        courses.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

        max_heap = []          # max-heap via negative values
        time = 0

        for dur, last in courses:
            if time + dur <= last:
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, -dur)
                time += dur
            elif max_heap and -max_heap[0] > dur:
                time += dur + heapq.heappop(max_heap)  # pop largest (negative)
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, -dur)

        return len(max_heap)
```

> **Complexity**: `O(n log n)` time, `O(n)` space.

### 5.3 C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int scheduleCourse(vector<vector<int>>& courses) {
        // Sort by deadline
        sort(courses.begin(), courses.end(),
             [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
                 return a[1] < b[1];
             });

        priority_queue<int> maxHeap;   // max-heap of durations
        long long time = 0;

        for (const auto& c : courses) {
            int dur = c[0];
            int last = c[1];

            if (time + dur <= last) {
                maxHeap.push(dur);
                time += dur;
            } else if (!maxHeap.empty() && maxHeap.top() > dur) {
                time += dur - maxHeap.top();
                maxHeap.pop();
                maxHeap.push(dur);
            }
        }
        return static_cast<int>(maxHeap.size());
    }
};
```

> **Complexity**: `O(n log n)` time, `O(n)` space.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ How to Test & Validate

| Test Case | Expected Output | Reason |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| `[[100,200],[200,1300],[1000,1250],[2000,3200]]` | `3` | Example from LeetCode |
| `[[1,2]]` | `1` | Only one course fits |
| `[[3,2],[4,3]]` | `0` | No course can finish in time |
| `[[100,100],[200,200],[50,150]]` | `3` | All can be scheduled |
| Random large input (10‚Å¥ courses) | Runs in < 0.5‚ÄØs | Benchmarks |

Use unit tests (JUnit, PyTest, Google Test) to cover edge cases.

# Course Schedule III (LeetCode¬†630) ‚Äì The Ultimate Interview Guide

> **Keywords**: Course Schedule III, LeetCode 630, job interview algorithm, greedy algorithm, priority queue, Java solution, Python solution, C++ solution, coding interview, algorithm interview

## 1. Problem Overview
*You‚Äôre given a list of courses. Each course has a `duration` and a `deadline`.  
You start on day‚ÄØ1, can take one course at a time, and must finish each course no later than its deadline.  
Return the maximum number of courses you can finish.*

---

## 2. The Good ‚Äì Optimal Greedy + Max‚ÄëHeap Solution

**Why Greedy?**  
Sorting by deadline ensures we always respect the earliest constraints.  
Whenever we cannot add a new course, swapping the longest current course with a shorter one keeps the total time minimal.

**Algorithm Steps**

1. **Sort** courses by `lastDay` ascending.  
2. **Traverse** the sorted list.  
3. Maintain a **max‚Äëheap** of durations and a running `time`.  
4. For each course:
   * **If** `time + dur <= lastDay`: take it.  
   * **Else** if the heap‚Äôs largest duration > `dur`: replace it.  
5. Result is `heap.size()`.

**Complexities**  
- Time: `O(n log n)`  
- Space: `O(n)`

---

## 3. The Bad ‚Äì Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Using a **min‚Äëheap** | Use a **max‚Äëheap** to replace the longest course. |
| Skipping sorting | Always sort by deadline first. |
| Not swapping | Replace the longest only when it‚Äôs longer than the current course. |
| Ignoring overflow | Store `time` in `long`/`long long`. |

---

## 4. The Ugly ‚Äì Edge Cases & Variations

- Zero‚Äëduration courses (unlikely per constraints).  
- Tight deadlines or many courses with the same `lastDay`.  
- Extremely large inputs ‚Äì ensure heap operations are efficient.  
- Duplicate courses ‚Äì handled naturally by the algorithm.

## 5. Code Implementations

### 5.1 Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int scheduleCourse(int[][] courses) {

            int last = c[1];
            if (time + dur <= last) {
                maxHeap.offer(dur);
                time += dur;
            } else if (!maxHeap.isEmpty() && maxHeap.peek() > dur) {
