### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Summary

> **LeetCode 673 ‚Äì Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence**  
> **Difficulty:** Medium  
> **Function signature (Java):** `public int findNumberOfLIS(int[] nums);`  

> Given an integer array `nums`, return the **number of longest strictly increasing subsequences**.  
> A *subsequence* is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.  
>  
> **Examples**  
> ```text
> Input:  [1,3,5,4,7]          Output: 2
> Explanation: The two LIS are [1,3,4,7] and [1,3,5,7].
> 
> Input:  [2,2,2,2,2]          Output: 5
> Explanation: The longest LIS length is 1, and every single element is an LIS.
> ```
> **Constraints**  
> - 1¬†‚â§¬†nums.length¬†‚â§¬†2000  
> - ‚Äì10‚Å∂¬†‚â§¬†nums[i]¬†‚â§¬†10‚Å∂  
> The answer fits into a 32‚Äëbit integer.

## üìö Why This Problem is a *Classic* Interview Question

* **Dynamic programming** ‚Äì you learn how to keep state (`dp` + `count` arrays).  
* **Edge‚Äëcase handling** ‚Äì duplicate numbers, decreasing sequences, all‚Äëequal arrays.  
* **Time vs. Space trade‚Äëoffs** ‚Äì O(n¬≤) vs. potential O(n‚ÄØlog‚ÄØn) solutions for LIS length only.

## üîç The ‚ÄúGood‚Äù ‚Äì Simple, Clear, and Correct

| ‚úÖ Feature | Why it‚Äôs great |
|------------|----------------|
| **Two arrays** `dp` and `count` | Keeps length and *count* of LIS ending at each index. |
| **O(n¬≤) time** | 2000¬≤¬†=¬†4‚ÄØmillion iterations ‚Äì easily under 0.1‚ÄØs in Java/Python/C++. |
| **Single pass for result** | After the loops, just sum `count[i]` where `dp[i] == maxLen`. |
| **No external libraries** | Pure Java/CPython/C++ STL ‚Äì easy to copy‚Äëpaste into interviews. |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The ‚ÄúBad‚Äù ‚Äì Performance and Scalability

| ‚ùå Issue | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Quadratic time** | For `n = 2000`, still fine, but larger constraints (e.g., `n = 10‚Åµ`) would break. |
| **Cache‚Äëinefficient inner loop** | Each `i` loops over all previous `j`, causing many memory accesses. |
| **No early exit** | Even when we already found a longer LIS, we still compare all previous elements. |

> *Tip:* If you‚Äôre dealing with `n > 5000`, consider a divide‚Äëand‚Äëconquer or segment‚Äëtree approach, but for LeetCode it‚Äôs unnecessary.

---

## üíî The ‚ÄúUgly‚Äù ‚Äì Edge‚ÄëCase Quirks and Hard‚Äëto‚ÄëRead Code

1. **Off‚Äëby‚Äëone errors** ‚Äì initializing `dp`/`count` to `1` for each index.  
2. **Integer overflow** ‚Äì not an issue here because the result fits in 32‚Äëbit, but be careful when counting very large subsequences.  
3. **In‚Äëplace updates** ‚Äì mixing `dp[i]` updates inside the inner loop can lead to subtle bugs if not handled carefully.  
4. **Lack of comments** ‚Äì many solutions on LeetCode skip explanatory comments, making it hard to understand for newcomers.

> *Solution:* Add a small helper function that returns the maximum of two integers, or use `Math.max()` in Java / `max()` in Python / `std::max()` in C++ to keep code clean.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Implementations

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int findNumberOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        int[] dp    = new int[n];   // LIS length ending at i
        int[] count = new int[n];   // Number of LIS of that length ending at i
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
        Arrays.fill(count, 1);

        int maxLen = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    if (dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]) {
                        dp[i] = dp[j] + 1;
                        count[i] = count[j];

            }
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, dp[i]);
        }

        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (dp[i] == maxLen) result += count[i];

## üìà Complexity Analysis

| | **Time** | **Space** |
|---|---|---|
| **DP (O(n¬≤))** | `O(n¬≤)` ‚Äì 4‚ÄØmillion comparisons for `n = 2000`. | `O(n)` ‚Äì two integer arrays (`dp`, `count`). |

> *Why O(n¬≤) is fine:* LeetCode‚Äôs test suite caps `n` at 2000, making the solution comfortably fast for all inputs.  
> *Potential improvement:* If you only need the LIS length, you can achieve `O(n log n)` with patience sorting. However, counting the number of LIS inherently requires exploring all combinations, which brings us back to quadratic time unless you use more advanced data structures (Fenwick tree + coordinate compression) and handle duplicates carefully.

## üîö Takeaway

*LeetCode 673 is a perfect blend of dynamic programming, edge‚Äëcase nuance, and interview relevance. The classic `O(n¬≤)` DP solution is both **correct** and **efficient** for the constraints. The three language implementations above illustrate clean coding practices that impress hiring managers.*

> **Next steps:**  
> - Try tweaking the solution to use 64‚Äëbit integers (`long long` in C++/Java `long`) and test on random large arrays.  
> - Explore a `Fenwick tree + coordinate compression` approach if you want to challenge yourself further.  

Happy coding, and best of luck in your next interview! üöÄ
