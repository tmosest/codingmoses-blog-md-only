        # 685. Redundant Connection II – Full‑Stack Solution

| Language | File | Function/Method |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| **Java** | `Solution.java` | `public int[] findRedundantDirectedConnection(int[][] edges)` |
| **Python** | `solution.py` | `def findRedundantDirectedConnection(edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]` |
| **C++** | `solution.cpp` | `vector<int> findRedundantDirectedConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges)` |

## 1. Problem Recap (LeetCode 685)

> A *rooted tree* is a directed graph where exactly one node (the root) has no parent and every other node has exactly one parent.  
> We start with a rooted tree of `n` nodes (`1 … n`) and add **one extra directed edge**.  
> The resulting directed graph has `n` edges.  
> **Goal**: Remove one edge so that the graph becomes a rooted tree again.  
> If several edges could be removed, return the one that appears **last** in the input.

---

## 2. Core Idea

1. **Two problems can coexist** in the graph:
   * **Node with two parents** (in‑degree = 2).  
   * **Cycle** (two nodes become mutually reachable).

2. We detect a node with two parents by scanning the edges and recording the first and second incoming edges for each node.

3. Depending on the situation we either:
   * **Remove the second incoming edge** (when only the two‑parent issue exists).
   * **Remove the edge that completes the cycle** (when only the cycle exists).
   * **Remove the *first* incoming edge** (when both problems exist – the second incoming edge is the culprit of the cycle).

4. To test whether an edge causes a cycle we use **Union‑Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU)**, ignoring the suspect edge.

5. The last edge that breaks the cycle (or the first two‑parent edge, if no cycle) is the answer.

---

## 3. Complexity

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Build parent/indegree arrays | **O(n)** | **O(n)** |
| DSU (with path compression & union by rank) | **α(n)** amortized per `union`, total **O(n α(n)) ≈ O(n)** | **O(n)** |

The algorithm runs in linear time, well below the constraints (`n ≤ 1000`).

---

## 4. Edge Cases

| Case | Input | Expected Result |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1. Two parents, no cycle | `[[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]` | `[2,3]` |
| 2. Cycle, no double parent | `[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1]]` | `[4,1]` |
| 3. Both problems | `[[1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[4,1]]` | `[1,2]` |
| 4. Multiple candidates | Return the *last* valid edge in the list | – |
| 5. Minimum nodes | `n = 3` | Works |

## 🚀 Why You Should Master This Problem

- **Graph theory + DSU**: A rare combo recruiters love.  
- **Edge‑case handling**: Shows you can think ahead of test cases.  
- **Full‑stack implementation**: Java, Python, and C++ solutions ready for any tech stack.

---

## 📘 Problem Recap

A rooted tree has one root (no parent) and every other node has exactly one parent.  
Add one *extra* directed edge → graph now has `n` edges.  
Remove the *wrong* edge so the graph becomes a rooted tree again.  
If more than one edge could be removed, return the *last* edge in the input.

---

## 🔧 The “Good” – Union‑Find on a Directed Graph

Union‑Find (DSU) is classically used for **undirected** cycle detection.  
The trick for Redundant Connection II:

1. **Detect a node with two parents** (`indegree == 2`).  
2. **Ignore the suspect edge** (either the second incoming edge or an arbitrary one) and run DSU on the remaining edges.  
3. If `union(u, v)` fails (both belong to the same set), a **cycle** exists.  
4. The cycle‑forming edge is the answer unless a two‑parent conflict also exists, in which case the first incoming edge is the culprit.

Why does this work?  
Because in a rooted tree *every* node has at most one parent, so the graph can be treated as an **undirected forest** when we ignore direction. DSU tells us whether adding a particular edge would merge two previously separate components – that’s exactly what a directed cycle does.

---

## ❌ The “Bad” – Why You Can’t Just Flip the Graph

- **Direction matters**: If you blindly convert to an undirected graph, you miss the *two‑parent* scenario.  
- **Multiple conflicts**: There might be several nodes with indegree = 2. The algorithm stops at the first conflict but keeps the *last* candidate for removal.  
- **Large input**: While `n ≤ 1000` here, for larger constraints the DSU approach remains linear, but naive DFS would blow up.

---

## 👿 The “Ugly” – Hidden Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Skipping only the second conflict edge** | The second edge is *not always* the problematic one; if a cycle exists, the first conflict edge may be the cause. | Detect both conflicts, then during DSU decide which to skip based on whether a cycle is found. |
| **Not using path compression / union by rank** | In worst‑case `union` can become O(n), leading to O(n²) overall. | Implement DSU with path compression and rank/size union. |
| **Ignoring order requirement** | Many solutions return the *first* valid edge, not the *last*. | After detecting conflicts, check the *last* edge that causes the cycle or remove the first conflict edge accordingly. |
| **Assuming indegree 2 always means cycle** | A node can have two parents without creating a cycle (case 1). | Separate checks: two‑parent conflict *or* cycle *or* both. |

---

## 🎯 How the Solution Works – Step‑by‑Step

1. **Scan edges**  
   * Build an `indeg` array.  
   * Record the indices of the first and second incoming edge for the first node that gets two parents.

2. **Run Union‑Find**  
   * Initialize `parent[i] = i` and `rank[i] = 0`.  
   * For each edge `i` (except possibly the second conflict edge), call `find(u)` and `find(v)`.  
   * If `find(u) == find(v)`, a cycle is present.  

3. **Decide the answer**  
   * **Only cycle** → return current edge.  
   * **Only two parents** → return second conflict edge.  
   * **Both issues** → return the *first* conflict edge.  

4. **Return the appropriate edge**.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Sample Test Cases

```bash
$ python - <<'PY'
from solution import Solution
sol = Solution()
print(sol.findRedundantDirectedConnection([[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]))   # [2,3]
print(sol.findRedundantDirectedConnection([[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1]]))   # [4,1]
print(sol.findRedundantDirectedConnection([[1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[4,1]]))   # [1,2]
PY
```

All outputs match the expected results.

## 7. Interview Tips

| Tip | Explanation |
|-----|-------------|
| **Clarify the “last” rule** | Ask if “last” refers to the *input order* or the *last edge that breaks the cycle*.  The problem statement means the former. |
| **Mention DSU’s amortized constant time** | Recruiters appreciate you know that `α(n)` is effectively 1. |
| **Discuss the two‑parent vs cycle conflict** | Demonstrates your ability to reason about multiple simultaneous constraints. |
| **Show your code in the language the interviewer prefers** | LeetCode’s platform usually uses Java/Python/C++, but ask first. |
| **Explain path compression & union by rank** | Even if the interview uses `hash‑maps`, showing you can implement DSU from scratch shows depth. |

---

## 8. TL;DR

- Scan edges → find node with two parents (`firstConflict`, `secondConflict`).  
- Run DSU, skipping the suspect edge, to detect cycles.  
- Depending on which issues exist, return the correct edge:  
  * only cycle → the edge that creates it,  
  * only double parent → the second incoming edge,  
  * both → the first incoming edge.  
- Complexity: `O(n)` time, `O(n)` space.

---

## 9. Take‑away

- **Redundant Connection II** is a textbook example of *“solve a hard problem by reducing it to a simpler one”*.  
- The union‑find trick on a directed graph is a hidden gem that can impress hiring managers.  
- Master the edge‑case analysis, and you’ll be ready for similar LeetCode problems such as *"Network Delay Time"* (743) and *"Minimum Cost to Connect All Points"* (1584).

Good luck crushing that interview, and happy coding! 🚀
