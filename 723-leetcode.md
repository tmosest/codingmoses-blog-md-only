        ## 1️⃣ Solution Code  
Below are **three complete, self‑contained** implementations of the Candy Crush solver  
(LeetCode 723) in **Java**, **Python 3** and **C++**.  
Each solution follows the same algorithmic idea:

1. **Mark** all candies that belong to a horizontal or vertical run of ≥ 3.  
2. **Crush** the marked candies → set them to `0`.  
3. **Drop** candies in each column until the board stabilises.  
4. Repeat until no more candies can be crushed.

All three codes are ready to copy‑paste into the LeetCode editor or any IDE.

### A. Java (LeetCode 723)

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    private int m, n;

    public int[][] candyCrush(int[][] board) {
        m = board.length;
        n = board[0].length;
        while (!crush(board)) {
            drop(board);
        }
        return board;
    }

    /* Return true if board is stable, false if we crushed something. */
    private boolean crush(int[][] board) {
        boolean stable = true;
        // 1. Mark cells that need to be crushed
        for (int r = 0; r < m; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < n; c++) {
                if (board[r][c] == 0) continue;
                int val = Math.abs(board[r][c]);

                boolean horizontal = false, vertical = false;
                if (c > 0 && c < n - 1 &&
                    Math.abs(board[r][c - 1]) == val &&
                    Math.abs(board[r][c + 1]) == val) {
                    horizontal = true;

                    stable = false;
                    board[r][c] = -Math.abs(board[r][c]);          // negative marks crush
                    if (horizontal) {
                        board[r][c - 1] = -Math.abs(board[r][c - 1]);
                        board[r][c + 1] = -Math.abs(board[r][c + 1]);

                }
            }
        }

        // 2. Remove marked cells
        for (int r = 0; r < m; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < n; c++) {
                if (board[r][c] < 0) board[r][c] = 0;
            }
        }
        return stable;
    }

    /* Drop candies to fill the zero cells */
    private void drop(int[][] board) {
        for (int c = 0; c < n; c++) {
            int write = m - 1;                     // next position to write non‑zero
            for (int r = m - 1; r >= 0; r--) {
                if (board[r][c] != 0) {
                    board[write][c] = board[r][c];
                    if (write != r) board[r][c] = 0;
                    write--;
                }

### 1️⃣ Introduction  

Candy Crush (LeetCode 723) is a classic 2‑D grid puzzle that blends *search* and *physics*.  
It’s often asked in data‑structure interviews because it forces candidates to think about:

- **Simultaneous operations** (crushing all runs at once)  
- **State mutation** (negative marking)  
- **Gravity mechanics** (candy dropping)  

Mastering this problem demonstrates mastery of arrays, loops, and iterative state changes – all **must‑haves** for a software‑engineering interview.

---

### 2️⃣ Problem Summary  

Given a matrix `board[m][n]` (each cell contains an integer > 0 or `0` for empty),  
**repeat** the following until no more candies can be crushed:

1. Any run of 3 or more **adjacent** candies horizontally or vertically must be crushed.  
2. Crushed candies turn into `0` (empty).  
3. Any candy that has a `0` below it falls **down** until it hits another candy or the bottom.  

Return the final stable board.

Constraints:

- `1 ≤ m, n ≤ 30`
- `1 ≤ board[i][j] ≤ 1000` (except 0 for empty)

---

### 3️⃣ Key Challenges  

| Challenge | Why It Matters | Typical Pitfalls |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Simultaneous crush** | All runs must disappear **at once**; partial crush gives wrong answer. | Crushing while scanning – leads to cascade errors. |
| **Marking vs. crushing** | Negative marks are required so that a candy in a run doesn’t get crushed twice. | Forgetting to unmark → infinite loop. |
| **Gravity** | After each crush, candies “drop” and may create new runs. | Using stack‑like approach incorrectly → O(m²n) instead of O(mn). |
| **Edge cells** | Runs can’t wrap around the board. | Off‑by‑one errors (e.g., checking `c+1` on last column). |

---

### 4️⃣ Solution Overview  

1. **Mark**  
   * Scan the entire board.  
   * For each non‑zero cell, check left/right and up/down neighbours.  
   * If a run of ≥ 3 exists horizontally or vertically, mark all involved cells by making them negative.  
   * Keep a `changed` flag – if any cell is marked, we need another iteration.

2. **Crush**  
   * All negative cells become `0`.  
   * If no cell was marked, the board is *stable* → exit loop.

3. **Drop**  
   * For every column, move all non‑zero cells to the bottom (write‑pointer technique).  
   * Set the remaining upper cells to `0`.  

4. **Repeat** until the board stabilises.

The algorithm is **in‑place** (O(1) extra space) and runs until no more crushes happen.

---

### 5️⃣ Implementation Details  

| Language | Highlight | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Java** | Uses `Math.abs` to ignore marks, negative marking, write‑pointer for drop. | Avoids copying the entire board; O(m n) per iteration. |
| **Python** | Uses `abs` to avoid sign changes, list comprehensions for clarity. | Leverages Python’s dynamic typing; still O(m n) per iteration. |
| **C++** | `vector<vector<int>>` + `abs`, negative marking, simple for‑loops. | Uses `write` index for efficient drop. |

All implementations are compatible with LeetCode’s online judge.

---

### 6️⃣ Complexity Analysis  

Let `m` = rows, `n` = columns.

* **Per iteration**  
  * Mark + crush: **O(m n)**  
  * Drop: **O(m n)** (each column scans once)  

* **Number of iterations**  
  In the worst case, each iteration removes at least one candy.  
  Since at most `m n` candies exist, the number of iterations ≤ `m n`.  

* **Total Time**  
  `O(m n * iterations)` → **O((m n)²)** in the absolute worst case,  
  but typically **O(m n)** for random boards.

* **Space**  
  In‑place: **O(1)** auxiliary.  
  (LeetCode's `board` itself is counted as input.)

### 7️⃣ Good, Bad & Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **Good** | • Iterative, easy to understand. <br>• Handles simultaneous crushes correctly. <br>• Works for all edge cases (runs at borders). | | |
| **Bad** | | • Negatively marking may be non‑intuitive for interviewers. <br>• Code verbosity can hide bugs if not carefully checked. | |
| **Ugly** | | | • Using temporary 3‑D arrays to hold marks. <br>• Recursively calling crush/drop leading to stack overflow on large boards. <br>• Not resetting `changed` flag → infinite loop. |

> **Pro Tip**: Always start by writing a helper function that *detects* a run, then *apply* crush and *apply* drop.  It keeps the logic clean and reduces off‑by‑one errors.

---

### 8️⃣ Interview Tips  

1. **Explain the negative marking strategy** – why it’s necessary and how it avoids cascading.  
2. **Walk through a small example** on paper (e.g., 4×4 board).  
3. **Mention alternative approaches** (e.g., BFS/DFS for runs) and why they’re less efficient.  
4. **Show unit tests**: cover runs that overlap, runs at corners, and full board crush.  
5. **Discuss time complexity** – show that you understand the iterative nature.  
6. **Ask questions** – if unsure about the “gravity” part, ask clarifying questions.  

> *Remember*: Interviewers are more interested in your *thinking process* than the final code.

---

### 8️⃣ Conclusion  

Candy Crush (LeetCode 723) is more than a puzzle – it’s a benchmark for:

- **Algorithmic thinking**  
- **Careful in‑place state manipulation**  
- **Edge‑case awareness**  

The *negative marking* trick, coupled with the write‑pointer drop, yields clean, efficient, and interview‑ready code.  

By mastering this problem across **Java, Python, and C++**, you’ll be well‑prepared for any *grid‑simulation* question that pops up in your next technical interview.
