## 1. Problem Overview  

> **LeetCode 740 – Delete and Earn**  
> **Difficulty:** Medium  
> **Tags:** Dynamic Programming, Hashmap, Sorting

You’re given an array `nums`.  
You may repeatedly:

1. Pick any element `x` from `nums`.  
2. Earn `x` points.  
3. **Delete every element equal to `x‑1` or `x+1`** (including the picked `x` itself).  

Return the maximum total points you can earn.

## 2. Intuition: Why “House Robber” Works  

If you decide to “take” a particular value `k`, you can’t take `k‑1` or `k+1`.  
This is *exactly* the same restriction as the classic **House Robber** problem:  
“Rob a street of houses, you can’t rob two adjacent houses”.

*Replace houses → distinct numbers in `nums`*  
*Replace robbing a house → taking all copies of a number*  

The only difference is that the houses in House Robber are already sorted and have a fixed “value” (the amount of money in that house).  
In Delete & Earn, the “houses” are the *unique numbers*, and the “value of the house*” is **(value * frequency)**.

Thus, a simple 1‑dimensional DP suffices.

---

<a name="dp-solution"></a>
## 3. Dynamic‑Programming Solution  

1. **Count frequencies**  
   Build a `Map<int, int>` (or array) `freq` where `freq[v]` is the number of times `v` occurs.  
2. **Compute “value” of each number**  
   `value[v] = v * freq[v]` – the total points you would get if you take *all* copies of `v`.  
3. **DP over the value space**  
   Let `dp[i]` be the maximum points achievable considering all numbers `≤ i`.  
   Transition:  

   ```text
   dp[i] = max(dp[i-1],              // skip i
               dp[i-2] + value[i])   // take i
   ```

   Base cases:  
   `dp[0] = 0`  
   `dp[1] = value[1]` (if present).

Because the maximum number in `nums` is at most `10^4`, a linear DP array is trivial.

## 4. Full Code (Java, Python, C++)

> **Note:** All three implementations use `long` for intermediate sums to avoid overflow; the final answer fits in `int`.

### Java

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int deleteAndEarn(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;

        int maxVal = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();

        for (int v : nums) {
            maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, v);
            freq.put(v, freq.getOrDefault(v, 0) + 1);
        }

        long[] dp = new long[maxVal + 1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = (long) freq.getOrDefault(1, 0);

        for (int i = 2; i <= maxVal; i++) {
            long take = dp[i - 2] + (long) i * freq.getOrDefault(i, 0);
            long skip = dp[i - 1];
            dp[i] = Math.max(take, skip);
        }

        return (int) dp[maxVal];
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0

        freq = Counter(nums)
        max_val = max(nums)

        dp = [0] * (max_val + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        dp[1] = freq.get(1, 0)

        for i in range(2, max_val + 1):
            take = dp[i - 2] + i * freq.get(i, 0)
            skip = dp[i - 1]
            dp[i] = max(take, skip)

        return dp[max_val]
```

### C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        int maxVal = 0;
        for (int v : nums) {
            ++freq[v];
            maxVal = max(maxVal, v);
        }
        vector<long long> dp(maxVal + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = freq.count(1) ? freq[1] : 0; // value[1] = 1 * freq[1]
        for (int i = 2; i <= maxVal; ++i) {
            long long take = dp[i - 2] + 1LL * i * (freq.count(i) ? freq[i] : 0);
            long long skip = dp[i - 1];
            dp[i] = max(take, skip);
        }
        return static_cast<int>(dp[maxVal]);
    }
};
```

## 5. Complexity Analysis  

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Frequency counting | **O(N)** | **O(U)** – `U` unique values (≤ 10 000) |
| DP iteration | **O(maxVal)** | **O(maxVal)** – DP array of size `maxVal + 1` |
| Total | **O(N + maxVal)** | **O(maxVal)** |

With constraints `N ≤ 2·10⁴` and `maxVal ≤ 10⁴`, this is far below 1 ms in all three languages.

<a name="bad"></a>
## 6. “Bad” Pitfalls to Avoid  

| Mistake | Why it fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Using `int` for DP values when `N * maxVal` can exceed 2 147 483 647 | Overflow → wrong answer | Use `long`/`long long` for DP, cast back to `int` only at the end |
| Forgetting to handle `nums[0]` or `nums[1]` correctly | Null pointer or array‑index‑out‑of‑bounds | Explicit base cases: `dp[0] = 0; dp[1] = freq[1]` |
| Building DP over the entire range 0…10⁵ regardless of `maxVal` | Unnecessary memory/time | Use the actual maximum value found in input |
| Ignoring that deleting a number also removes *all* equal copies | You may think you can pick a number multiple times → incorrect | Transform into “take all copies at once” via `value[i] = i * freq[i]` |

---

<a name="ugly"></a>
## 7. “Ugly” Scenarios & How to Tackle Them  

* **Very large input arrays (e.g., 2 × 10⁵)** – still fine, O(N) preprocessing.  
* **All numbers equal to 1** – the DP degenerates to a single state. Handle with the base case.  
* **Sparse value space (e.g., numbers 1 and 10⁴ only)** – DP array still O(10⁴). If you want extra optimization, compress the value space and use a map‑based DP, but the gain is negligible for given constraints.

### Introduction  

When I first saw **LeetCode 740 – Delete & Earn**, I thought it looked like a puzzle. The operation rules are simple: pick a number, earn points, and wipe out all neighbors. But the trick lies in *planning* ahead.  
In this article, I’ll walk through the problem, show how it maps to the classic **House Robber** DP, and provide ready‑to‑copy code in **Java, Python, and C++**. I’ll also share “good, bad, and ugly” insights that helped me nail the interview and landed me a software engineer role.

> **TL;DR** – Convert the array into a “value per number” map, then run a 1‑dimensional DP over the value space. The transition is `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + i * freq[i])`.

---

### The Problem, Re‑Stated  

You’re given an integer array `nums`.  
You may do this any number of times:

1. Choose an element `x`.  
2. Gain `x` points.  
3. Delete *every* element equal to `x‑1` or `x+1` (including `x`).

Your goal: **maximize total points**.

---

### Step 1 – Frequency Map  

The first observation: **all copies of the same number behave identically**. If you decide to take number `k`, you’re forced to take *every* `k` present, because leaving any copy would let you pick a neighbor later, which is impossible.  
So, for each distinct value `v`, compute:

```text
points[v] = v * count(v)   // all copies at once
```

In code, a `HashMap` (Java/C++ `unordered_map`) or a simple array (Python `Counter`) does the job.

---

### Step 2 – The House Robber Connection  

Imagine each distinct value as a “house” in a row sorted by value.  
Robbing house `i` earns `points[i]`, but you cannot rob houses `i‑1` or `i+1`.  
That’s literally the House Robber recurrence!  

Let’s define:

* `dp[0] = 0` – no numbers considered.  
* `dp[1] = points[1]` – only the value `1` can be taken.  

Then for every `i ≥ 2`:

```text
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1],          // skip number i
            dp[i-2] + points[i]) // take number i
```

Why `i-2`? Because if you take `i`, you cannot take `i-1`, but you can safely consider `i-2`.

        dp = [0]*(m+1)
        dp[1] = freq.get(1,0)
        for i in range(2,m+1):

    int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {

        unordered_map<int,int> freq;
        int mx=0;
        for (int v: nums) { ++freq[v]; mx=max(mx,v); }
        vector<long long> dp(mx+1,0);
        dp[1] = freq.count(1)?freq[1]:0;
        for (int i=2;i<=mx;i++) {
            long long take = dp[i-2] + 1LL*i*(freq.count(i)?freq[i]:0);
            dp[i] = max(take,dp[i-1]);
        }
        return (int)dp[mx];
    }
};
```</details> |

All three solutions are **O(N + maxVal)** time and **O(maxVal)** space. For `maxVal ≤ 10⁴`, this is practically instant.

### Practical Interview Tips  

1. **Explain the mapping early** – “I see Delete & Earn as a House Robber DP after aggregating frequencies.”  
2. **Mention overflow risk** – “I used 64‑bit integers to be safe.”  
3. **Ask clarifying questions** – “Do we need to pick numbers multiple times?” → “No, once you pick a number, all copies vanish.”  
4. **Show a quick test case** – e.g., `nums = [3,4,2]` → answer `6`.  
5. **Talk about time‑space trade‑offs** – compressed value map vs. array DP.
