        # üéØ LeetCode 829 ‚Äì Consecutive Numbers Sum  
> ‚Äú**How many ways can you write an integer‚ÄØn as the sum of consecutive positive integers?**‚Äù

This problem is a *Hard* one on LeetCode but it can be cracked with a single mathematical insight.  
Below you‚Äôll find clean, production‚Äëready solutions in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**, followed by a full‚Äëblown blog article that explains the trick, the pitfalls, and how to use this knowledge to impress recruiters.

## ‚úÖ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Solution Overview

The sum of `k` consecutive integers starting with `x` is

```
x + (x+1) + ‚Ä¶ + (x+k-1) = k¬∑x + k(k-1)/2
```

We want this to equal `n`.  Hence

```
k¬∑x = n ‚Äì k(k-1)/2
```

* `x` must be a **positive integer** ‚Üí RHS > 0  
* `k` must be a positive integer  

The loop bound comes from the inequality `n > k(k-1)/2` ‚Üí `k < sqrt(2n)`.  
The *only* check needed inside the loop is whether `n ‚Äì k(k-1)/2` is divisible by `k`.

This gives an **O(‚àön)** time algorithm with **O(1)** space.

## üßë‚Äçüíª 2Ô∏è‚É£ Code ‚Äì 3 Languages

| Language | Code |
|----------|------|
| **Java** | ```java <br>class Solution { <br>    public int consecutiveNumbersSum(int n) { <br>        int count = 0; <br>        for (int k = 1; k * k < 2L * n; k++) { <br>            int rhs = n - k * (k - 1) / 2; <br>            if (rhs <= 0) break; <br>            if (rhs % k == 0) count++; <br>        } <br>        return count; <br>    } <br>} ``` |
| **Python** | ```python <br>class Solution: <br>    def consecutiveNumbersSum(self, n: int) -> int: <br>        count = 0 <br>        k = 1 <br>        while k * k < 2 * n: <br>            rhs = n - k * (k - 1) // 2 <br>            if rhs <= 0: <br>                break <br>            if rhs % k == 0: <br>                count += 1 <br>            k += 1 <br>        return count ``` |
| **C++** | ```cpp <br>class Solution { <br>public: <br>    int consecutiveNumbersSum(int n) { <br>        int count = 0; <br>        for (long long k = 1; k * k < 2LL * n; ++k) { <br>            long long rhs = n - k * (k - 1) / 2; <br>            if (rhs <= 0) break; <br>            if (rhs % k == 0) ++count; <br>        } <br>        return count; <br>    } <br>}; ``` |

> **Why `long long` in C++?**  
> `k * k` can overflow `int` when `n` approaches `10^9`. Using `long long` keeps us safe.

### Introduction

LeetCode‚Äôs **829 ‚Äì Consecutive Numbers Sum** is a deceptively hard problem. It appears in many interview prep lists because it tests a candidate‚Äôs ability to combine *math* with *algorithmic thinking*.  
In this article we‚Äôll:

1. Derive the math behind the solution.  
2. Provide clean, production‚Äëgrade code in Java, Python, and C++.  
3. Discuss the *good*, *bad*, and *ugly* parts of typical approaches.  
4. Explain how to frame this problem in an interview to land that job.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Good ‚Äì A One‚ÄëLiner Math Trick

The beauty lies in recognizing that each *sequence length* `k` gives **at most one** starting integer `x`.  
The core equation

```
k¬∑x + k(k-1)/2 = n   ‚Üí   k¬∑x = n ‚Äì k(k-1)/2
```

From here:

* `x` must be positive ‚Üí `n > k(k-1)/2`.  
* The loop bound becomes `k < sqrt(2n)`.  
* The only test: `(n ‚Äì k(k-1)/2) % k == 0`.

All of this is **O(‚àön)**, far faster than brute force.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Bad ‚Äì Brute‚ÄëForce Pitfalls

Many try to simulate all starting points:

```python
for start in range(1, n):
    sum = 0
    length = 0
    while sum < n:
        sum += start + length
        length += 1
        if sum == n:
            count += 1
```

* **Time:** O(n¬≤) ‚Äì infeasible for n = 10‚Åπ.  
* **Space:** trivial, but the loop count is astronomically high.  
* **Maintainability:** Hard to reason about correctness.

The brute‚Äëforce approach quickly turns into a **time‚Äëout nightmare** on LeetCode and is a red flag for recruiters.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Ugly ‚Äì Over‚ÄëEngineering with Data Structures

Some solutions try to pre‚Äëcompute all triangular numbers or use hash maps:

```java
Set<Integer> triangular = new HashSet<>();
for (int k = 1; k < Math.sqrt(2*n); k++) {
    triangular.add(k*(k+1)/2);
}
```

* Adds unnecessary memory overhead.  
* Complexity stays O(‚àön) but constant factors blow up.  
* Not as readable for interviewers.

The takeaway: **Keep it simple.** A single loop with a division check beats a set or map in clarity and speed.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Interview‚ÄëReady Narrative

> **‚ÄúI solved LeetCode 829 by first observing that each length of consecutive numbers yields at most one valid sequence. I derived the formula `k¬∑x + k(k-1)/2 = n`, bounded k by `sqrt(2n)`, and then only checked divisibility. This gives an O(‚àön) algorithm, which runs in milliseconds for `n = 10‚Åπ`. I implemented it cleanly in Java, Python, and C++.‚Äù**

Key points recruiters love:

* **Mathematical insight** ‚Äì shows you can turn a problem into equations.  
* **Complexity awareness** ‚Äì you know why O(‚àön) is fast.  
* **Cross‚Äëlanguage proficiency** ‚Äì you can code in the stack they use.  
* **Clean code** ‚Äì no magic, no over‚Äëengineering.
