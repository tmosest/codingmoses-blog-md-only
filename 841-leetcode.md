### 📚 Problem Recap

> **LeetCode 841 – Keys and Rooms**  
> *Given `n` rooms labeled `0 … n-1`. Room `0` is unlocked; every other room is locked.  
> In each room you may find a set of unique keys that open other rooms.  
> Determine whether you can visit *all* rooms starting from room `0`.*

**Input:**  
```text
rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
```
**Output:**  
```text
true
```

### 🔍 Why Interviewers Love This Question

* **Graph basics** – It’s a classic “reachability” problem.
* **Data‑structure knowledge** – Requires an adjacency‑list interpretation.
* **Algorithmic thinking** – DFS/BFS choice, recursion vs. stack, handling cycles.
* **Edge‑case handling** – Empty rooms, self‑loops, large key sets.

---

## The Good – A Clean DFS Solution

1. **Model the problem as a directed graph.**  
   * Each room is a node.  
   * Each key is a directed edge from the current room to the target room.

2. **Depth‑First Search (DFS).**  
   * Start at node `0`.  
   * Recursively visit every neighbor that hasn’t been visited yet.  
   * Mark rooms as visited to avoid revisiting and infinite loops.

3. **Check reachability.**  
   * After DFS, if all `n` rooms are marked visited, answer `true`; otherwise `false`.

**Why DFS?**  
* Recursion is natural for exploring neighbors.  
* The graph depth is bounded by `n ≤ 1000`, so recursion stack won’t overflow in typical interview environments.  
* Simpler code → fewer bugs.

## The Bad – Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Missing the `visited` flag** | Infinite recursion if a key points back to a visited room. | Use a `boolean[] visited` array and check before recursing. |
| **Assuming all rooms are connected** | Overlooking that some rooms might be isolated or locked forever. | Verify after DFS that every element of `visited` is `true`. |
| **Stack overflow on deep recursion** | For very deep graphs, the JVM/CPython stack may exceed limits. | Use an iterative DFS or BFS when `n` is large (e.g., > 10^5). |
| **Mutable data structures** | Accidentally modifying input lists while iterating. | Iterate over a copy or simply avoid modifications. |
| **Time complexity miscalculation** | Thinking it’s O(n²) unnecessarily. | It’s O(n + E) where `E` is total number of keys. |

## The Ugly – Edge Cases & Hidden Traps

* **Self‑loops:** `rooms[i] = [i]` – should still be considered visited.  
* **Duplicate keys:** Problem guarantees unique keys per room, but defensive code is always safer.  
* **Circular dependencies:** `0 → 1 → 2 → 0` – DFS handles this as long as the `visited` flag works.  
* **Large key sets in a single room:** `rooms[i]` can have up to `1000` keys; avoid nested loops that could hit O(n²) in practice.  
* **Empty `rooms`:** According to constraints, `n ≥ 2`, but guard against `n = 0` in generic code.

## 🛠️ Multi‑Language Implementations

Below are three succinct, production‑ready solutions: Java, Python, and C++.

> **Tip:** If you’re applying for a role that lists any of these languages, copy‑paste the relevant code into your portfolio or GitHub README. Demonstrate that you understand the algorithm and can adapt it to your stack.

### Java – Recursive DFS

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private void dfs(List<List<Integer>> rooms, boolean[] visited, int room) {
        visited[room] = true;
        for (int next : rooms.get(room)) {
            if (!visited[next]) {
                dfs(rooms, visited, next);
            }
        }
    }

    public boolean canVisitAllRooms(List<List<Integer>> rooms) {
        int n = rooms.size();
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        dfs(rooms, visited, 0);

        for (boolean v : visited) {
            if (!v) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

---

### Python – Iterative DFS (stack)

```python
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        n = len(rooms)
        visited = [False] * n
        stack = [0]
        visited[0] = True

        while stack:
            room = stack.pop()
            for key in rooms[room]:
                if not visited[key]:
                    visited[key] = True
                    stack.append(key)

        return all(visited)
```

> *Why iterative?* Avoids recursion depth limits in CPython for very deep graphs.

---

### C++ – Recursive DFS (modern style)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(const vector<vector<int>>& rooms, vector<bool>& visited, int room) {
        visited[room] = true;
        for (int next : rooms[room]) {
            if (!visited[next]) dfs(rooms, visited, next);
        }
    }

    bool canVisitAllRooms(vector<vector<int>>& rooms) {
        int n = rooms.size();
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        dfs(rooms, visited, 0);

        return all_of(visited.begin(), visited.end(), [](bool v){ return v; });
    }
};
```

## 📈 Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| DFS traversal | **O(n + E)** – every room + every key examined once | **O(n)** – visited array + recursion stack (≤ n) |

With `n ≤ 1000` and `E ≤ 3000`, this runs comfortably within any interview timeout.

## 🎯 How to Use This in Your Interview

1. **Explain the graph model** – show you see rooms as nodes and keys as edges.
2. **Justify DFS vs. BFS** – both work; DFS is shorter to code, but BFS is safer for recursion limits.
3. **Mention visited array** – emphasise cycle detection.
4. **Walk through a quick example** on the whiteboard.
5. **Highlight pitfalls** – ask if they’d prefer an iterative version for very large data.
6. **Show multi‑language confidence** – mention “Here’s how I’d implement it in Java/Python/C++” (use the code blocks above).
7. **Wrap up** – confirm that you check all rooms after traversal.

> **Recruiter Hook:** “I solved LeetCode 841 using a clean DFS algorithm that scales linearly with the number of rooms and keys. My code is fully portable to Java, Python, and C++—ready for any stack you’re hiring.”  

Add this bullet point to your résumé or GitHub project list to make it *searchable* by hiring managers looking for “graph traversal” or “LeetCode” skills.
