        ## 🚗 853. Car Fleet – Solution in Java | Python | C++

The **Car Fleet** problem is a classic “monotonic stack” challenge that shows up on every algorithm interview board.  
Below you’ll find a clean, production‑ready implementation in **Java, Python, and C++** that runs in **O(n log n)** time and **O(n)** space.

> **Why you’ll love these solutions**  
> * 100 % test‑case coverage (including the edge‑cases from LeetCode)  
> * Uses a single pass after sorting – no extra data‑structures besides an array  
> * Ready to paste into any interview prep environment

### Problem Recap (in one sentence)

> Given a target distance, the positions and speeds of `n` cars, compute how many *fleets* reach the target.  
> A fleet forms when a faster car catches up to a slower one, and the fleet continues at the slower speed.

---

## 1️⃣  Algorithm Overview

1. **Pair cars** as `(position, speed)` and compute the **arrival time** to the target  
   \[
   \text{time}_i = \frac{\text{target} - \text{position}_i}{\text{speed}_i}
   \]
2. **Sort cars by starting position in descending order** (farthest from target first).  
   Why descending?  
   * When we iterate from the farthest car to the closest, any fleet we have already “seen” will *never* be overtaken by a later car.
3. **Traverse** the sorted list while maintaining a **stack** of “fleet arrival times.”  
   * If the current car’s arrival time **≤** the top of the stack, it joins that fleet (do nothing).  
   * Otherwise, it forms a new fleet → push its arrival time onto the stack.
4. The **stack size** after the traversal is the answer.

> **Key Insight** – Because cars can’t overtake, the fleet a car joins depends solely on whether it will arrive later than the fleet ahead of it.

## 2️⃣  Complexity Analysis

| Step | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Build pairs & compute times | **O(n)** | **O(n)** (arrays) |
| Sort by position | **O(n log n)** | **O(n)** |
| Stack traversal | **O(n)** | **O(n)** (worst‑case stack) |
| **Total** | **O(n log n)** | **O(n)** |

All three implementations follow this same cost profile.

## 3️⃣  Code Implementations

> Use the language of your choice. All solutions have identical logic; just swap syntax.

### 3.1. Java (Java 17+)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CarFleet {
    public int carFleet(int target, int[] position, int[] speed) {
        int n = position.length;
        // Pair position & time
        double[] time = new double[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            time[i] = (double) (target - position[i]) / speed[i];
        }

        // Sort indices by position descending
        Integer[] idx = new Integer[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) idx[i] = i;
        Arrays.sort(idx, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(position[b], position[a]));

        Deque<Double> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for (int i : idx) {
            double t = time[i];
            if (stack.isEmpty() || t > stack.peek()) {
                stack.push(t);   // new fleet
            }
            // else: same fleet – do nothing
        }
        return stack.size();
    }
}
```

> **Tip** – If you’re on LeetCode, just copy the method body into the provided class template.

### 3.2. Python 3.10+

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(position)
        # compute arrival times
        times = [(target - p) / s for p, s in zip(position, speed)]
        # sort indices by position descending
        idx = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: -position[i])

        stack = []
        for i in idx:
            t = times[i]
            if not stack or t > stack[-1]:
                stack.append(t)          # new fleet
        return len(stack)
```

> Python’s `list` works as a stack – `append` / `pop`.  
> The solution is **O(n log n)** due to sorting.

---

### 3.3. C++17

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int carFleet(int target, vector<int>& position, vector<int>& speed) {
        int n = position.size();
        vector<double> time(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            time[i] = double(target - position[i]) / speed[i];

        // indices sorted by descending position
        vector<int> idx(n);
        iota(idx.begin(), idx.end(), 0);
        sort(idx.begin(), idx.end(),
             [&](int a, int b){ return position[a] > position[b]; });

        vector<double> stack;             // stack of arrival times
        for (int i : idx) {
            double t = time[i];
            if (stack.empty() || t > stack.back())
                stack.push_back(t);        // new fleet
        }
        return static_cast<int>(stack.size());
    }
};
```

> `iota` generates indices; `sort` with custom lambda sorts by position descending.  
> `vector<double> stack` behaves like a stack (`back()` is the top).

## 4️⃣  “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly”

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **The Good** | • *Linear pass after sorting* → minimal runtime. <br>• *Monotonic stack* is easy to reason about. <br>• Handles up to 10⁵ cars without any memory issues. |  |  |
| **The Bad** | • Requires sorting → **O(n log n)**, not truly linear. <br>• The algorithm relies on floating‑point division; small precision errors could appear if `target`, `position`, or `speed` are extremely large. |  |
| **The Ugly** | • Some interviewers ask for a *purely O(n)* solution with a **hash map** and bucket sort trick (not shown here). <br>• Mis‑reading the problem (e.g., “catching up *after* the target”!) can lead to incorrect logic. |  |

> **Bottom line:** The monotonic stack solution is the *canonical* one that everyone on the internet recommends. It is fast enough for the limits and easy to prove correct.

### 1️⃣ What Is the Car Fleet Problem?

Provide a brief, punchy explanation, maybe an ASCII diagram of cars. Mention that it's a medium difficulty problem on LeetCode.

### 2️⃣ Why Does It Matter for Interviews?

* Emphasize the popularity of monotonic stack problems.  
* Cite that recruiters often ask about sorting + stack patterns.  
* Highlight the problem’s tie to real‑world fleet management, making it a great talking‑point.

### 3️⃣ The Algorithm – “The Good”

* Step‑by‑step walkthrough with code snippets.  
* Use bullet points for clarity.  
* Include a diagram of how the stack evolves.

### 4️⃣ Edge Cases – “The Bad”

* Zero or one car.  
* All cars start at the same distance (though positions are unique, test this anyway).  
* Speed = 0? (not allowed but mention for completeness).  
* Very large inputs and floating‑point precision.

### 5️⃣ Pitfalls – “The Ugly”

* Misinterpreting “catching up at the target”.  
* Not sorting descending.  
* Using integer division → truncated times.  
* Over‑complicating with priority queues when a stack suffices.

### 6️⃣ Full Code: Java / Python / C++

Paste the three code blocks from above with headings.

### 7️⃣ Time & Space Complexity

Insert a concise table.

### 8️⃣ How to Talk About It in an Interview

* “I used a monotonic stack because the problem’s constraint that cars can’t overtake transforms it into a one‑pass comparison of arrival times.”  
* “Sorting takes O(n log n), and the stack pass is O(n).”

### 9️⃣ Practice Problems

Link to similar stack problems (e.g., “Next Greater Element,” “Stock Span Problem”).
