## 1. Problem Recap

Given a binary array `arr` (`0`/`1` only), divide it into **three non‑empty contiguous parts** so that:

- Each part represents the same binary value (leading zeros allowed).
- Return indices `[i, j]` with `i + 1 < j`:
  - `arr[0 … i]`  →  first part
  - `arr[i+1 … j-1]` → second part
  - `arr[j … n-1]` → third part
- If impossible, return `[-1, -1]`.

**Examples**

| arr | Output |
|-----|--------|
| `[1,0,1,0,1]` | `[0,3]` |
| `[1,1,0,1,1]` | `[-1,-1]` |
| `[1,1,0,0,1]` | `[0,2]` |

---

## 2. Key Observations

| # | Observation | Why it matters |
|---|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Count of 1’s must be divisible by 3** | Each part must contain the same number of 1’s. |
| 2 | **All zeros → any split works** | 0 value is the same regardless of boundaries. |
| 3 | **Pattern after the first 1 of each part must match** | Leading zeros don’t change value; the *sequence of 1’s and 0’s* after the first 1 is the defining pattern. |
| 4 | **Trailing zeros on the rightmost part are “free”** | We can shift the right‑most part left to accommodate the other two. |

These observations let us solve the problem with a **single linear scan** and a couple of pointer moves.

---

## 3. Algorithm (O(n) time, O(1) space)

1. **Count total 1’s** (`totalOnes`).  
   - If `totalOnes == 0` → return `[0, n-2]` (any split works).  
   - If `totalOnes % 3 != 0` → return `[-1, -1]`.
2. **Find the start index of the last part**.  
   - Scan from the end; when you have seen `totalOnes/3` 1’s, record that index (`idxThird`).  
3. **Find the end of the first part (`i`)** by comparing the pattern starting at `idxThird` with the array from the beginning.  
   - Skip leading zeros at the start, then match each element until the right‑hand pattern ends.  
   - If mismatch → impossible.
4. **Find the end of the second part (`j`)** in the same way, starting just after the first part.  
5. Return `[i, j]`.

The matching step is essentially *two‑pointer equality* of the target pattern.

---

## 4. Complexity Analysis

| Measure | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Time    | `O(n)` – one pass to count + two passes to match the pattern |
| Space   | `O(1)` – only a handful of indices, no auxiliary arrays |

---

## 5. Edge‑Case Checklist

| Edge Case | What to do |
|-----------|------------|
| All zeros | Return `[0, n-2]` |
| `totalOnes % 3 != 0` | `[-1,-1]` |
| Insufficient trailing zeros to align patterns | `[-1,-1]` |
| Leading zeros before first 1 | They’re ignored during pattern matching |

## 6. Code (Java / Python / C++)

### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] threeEqualParts(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int totalOnes = 0;
        for (int v : arr) if (v == 1) totalOnes++;

        // 1. All zeros
        if (totalOnes == 0) return new int[] {0, n - 2};

        // 2. Impossible split
        if (totalOnes % 3 != 0) return new int[] {-1, -1};

        int onesPerPart = totalOnes / 3;

        // 3. Find the start of the third part
        int idxThird = n - 1;
        int seen = 0;
        while (idxThird >= 0) {
            if (arr[idxThird] == 1) seen++;
            if (seen == onesPerPart) break;
            idxThird--;
        }

        // 4. Find first part end (i)
        int i = findPart(arr, 0, idxThird);
        if (i == -1) return new int[] {-1, -1};

        // 5. Find second part end (j)
        int j = findPart(arr, i, idxThird);
        if (j == -1) return new int[] {-1, -1};

        return new int[]{i - 1, j};
    }

    private int findPart(int[] arr, int start, int target) {
        // Skip leading zeros
        while (start < arr.length && arr[start] == 0) start++;

        // Match pattern
        while (target < arr.length) {
            if (arr[start] != arr[target]) return -1;
            start++; target++;
        }
        return start;          // start now points to the first index of the next part
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def threeEqualParts(self, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(arr)
        total_ones = arr.count(1)

        # 1. All zeros
        if total_ones == 0:
            return [0, n - 2]

        # 2. Impossible split
        if total_ones % 3:
            return [-1, -1]

        k = total_ones // 3
        # 3. Find the start of the last part
        idx_third = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if arr[i] == 1:
                k -= 1
                if k == 0:
                    idx_third = i
                    break

        # Helper to match pattern
        def match(start):
            i = start
            while i < n and arr[i] == 0:
                i += 1
            j = idx_third
            while j < n:
                if arr[i] != arr[j]:
                    return -1
                i += 1
                j += 1
            return i

        i = match(0)
        if i == -1:
            return [-1, -1]
        j = match(i)
        if j == -1:
            return [-1, -1]

        return [i - 1, j]
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> threeEqualParts(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int totalOnes = 0;
        for (int v : arr) if (v == 1) totalOnes++;

        if (totalOnes == 0) return {0, n - 2};
        if (totalOnes % 3) return {-1, -1};

        int k = totalOnes / 3;
        int idxThird = n;
        int seen = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (arr[i] == 1) {
                seen++;
                if (seen == k) {
                    idxThird = i;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        auto findPart = [&](int start) {
            // skip leading zeros
            while (start < n && arr[start] == 0) start++;
            int j = idxThird;
            while (j < n) {
                if (arr[start] != arr[j]) return -1;
                start++; j++;
            }
            return start;
        };

        int i = findPart(0);
        if (i == -1) return {-1, -1};
        int j = findPart(i);
        if (j == -1) return {-1, -1};

        return {i - 1, j};
    }
};
```

## 7. Good, Bad & Ugly

| Aspect | Good | Bad | Ugly |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| **What works** | One‑pass counting + pattern matching is **clear** and uses only indices. | **Readability** – the logic is simple but many people get lost in “trailing zeros” handling. |
| **What’s fragile** | Leading/trailing zeros mis‑handled → wrong split. | Edge‑case `totalOnes == 0` often forgotten; official editorial sometimes returns `[0, n-1]` incorrectly. |
| **What the official solution hides** | Official Java/C++ solutions add *extra arrays* to build the value string, making it O(n²) in practice. | They also use a “hash‑like” trick that is hard to understand in an interview. |
| **Interview take‑away** | Keep the solution **pure** – focus on counting 1’s and two pointer matching. | Don’t over‑complicate; explain each step. |

### 📚 Three Equal Parts – LeetCode 927  
**An O(n) interview‑friendly solution in Java, Python & C++**

---

#### 🔎 Why you should care

* “Three Equal Parts” is a classic LeetCode challenge that tests your **array manipulation** and **pattern‑matching** skills – both of which appear in many system‑design and coding interviews.  
* Mastering this problem showcases:
  - Ability to derive constraints from the problem statement.
  - Writing **time‑efficient** code (O(n)) while keeping space constant.
  - Explaining edge‑case handling – a must‑have in a senior developer interview.

---

#### 🏁 Problem Statement

(see above – copy the bullet list of the problem description)

---

#### 💡 Observations – The “aha” moments

1. Total number of 1’s must divide by 3.  
2. If all zeros – any split works.  
3. After the first 1 the 0/1 pattern fully defines the value.  
4. Trailing zeros on the last part can be ignored.

These form the backbone of our linear‑time solution.

---

#### 🚀 The Algorithm

```
1. Count 1's → totalOnes
2. If totalOnes == 0: return [0, n-2]
3. If totalOnes % 3 != 0: return [-1, -1]
4. Find index where last part starts (idxThird)
5. Find end of first part by matching pattern with idxThird
6. Find end of second part similarly
7. Return [i, j]
```

*Matching* is done with two pointers – one walking the array from the left, the other walking the target pattern from the right.

---

#### 📐 Complexity

| Time | Space |
|------|-------|
| **O(n)** | **O(1)** |

---

#### 🔧 Code

*(Java, Python, C++ blocks above)*

---

#### 📏 Edge Cases

* All zeros
* `totalOnes % 3 != 0`
* Mismatch in pattern matching
* Leading/trailing zeros

---

#### 🎯 How to Explain This in an Interview

> “I first realized that each part must contain the same number of 1’s, so I checked divisibility. Then I noted that the sequence after the first 1 uniquely identifies the value. By scanning from the end I can locate where the last part starts, and with two simple pointer comparisons I verify the other two parts. The solution is O(n) time and O(1) space.”

---

#### 👇 Quick Test

```java
int[] arr = {1,0,1,0,1};
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(new Solution().threeEqualParts(arr))); // [0, 3]
```

*(Python and C++ tests are analogous.)*

---

#### 🎤 Good, Bad & Ugly

- **Good** – The algorithm is straightforward, uses only indices, and avoids constructing strings or large arrays.  
- **Bad** – Many solutions forget to handle the *all‑zeros* case or miscount trailing zeros, leading to wrong splits.  
- **Ugly** – The official editorial often presents a “two‑array copy” method that is conceptually simple but **O(n²)** if not careful, making it unattractive for interviewers who value clean O(n) logic.

---

#### 🚀 Takeaway for Your Next Interview

1. **Speak the observations**: “Total ones must be divisible by three, trailing zeros don’t matter.”  
2. **Show the linear pass**: “I’ll scan once to count, then another pass to match the pattern.”  
3. **Mention space efficiency**: “No extra arrays, just a handful of indices.”  
4. **Highlight edge cases**: “All zeros – any split; impossible split – quick reject.”  

Demonstrating this problem solution will impress hiring managers who are looking for developers who think algorithmically from the outset.
