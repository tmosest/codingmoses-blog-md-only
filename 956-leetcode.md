        ## üèóÔ∏è 956 ‚Äì Tallest Billboard  
### A Deep‚ÄëDive into the DP ‚ÄúDifference‚Äù Trick  
*(Java | Python | C++ implementations + a job‚Äëready blog post)*  

---

### TL;DR  

| Language | Runtime | Memory | Link |
|----------|---------|--------|------|
| **Java** | `O(N ¬∑ S)` | `O(S)` | ‚úÖ |
| **Python** | `O(N ¬∑ S)` | `O(S)` | ‚úÖ |
| **C++** | `O(N ¬∑ S)` | `O(S)` | ‚úÖ |

`S = sum(rods) ‚â§ 5000`, `N ‚â§ 20`.  
The key idea: keep track of the **difference** between the two supports.  
The DP state `dp[diff]` stores the maximum height of the *shorter* support
when the two supports differ by `diff`.  
At the end, the answer is `dp[0]` (equal heights).  

---

## 1. Problem Recap  

You‚Äôre given up to 20 rods (each ‚â§‚ÄØ1000).  
You can weld any subset of them into a left support, another disjoint subset
into a right support.  
Both supports must have **exactly the same height**.  
Return the maximum possible height, or `0` if impossible.  

---

## 2. Why the ‚ÄúDifference‚Äù DP Works  

Instead of trying every partition (exponential), we keep a *difference* table:

* `diff = |height_left ‚Äì height_right|`  
* `dp[diff] = maximum height of the shorter support`  

Why is this enough?  

1. **If you add a rod to the shorter side**  
   * `new_diff = diff + rod`  
   * The shorter side stays the same (height doesn‚Äôt change), so  
     `dp[new_diff] = max(dp[new_diff], dp[diff])`.  

2. **If you add a rod to the longer side**  
   * The rod reduces the difference.  
   * The *shorter* side‚Äôs height increases by `min(rod, diff)`  
   * `new_diff = |diff ‚Äì rod|`  
   * `dp[new_diff] = max(dp[new_diff], dp[diff] + min(rod, diff))`.  

3. **If you skip the rod**  
   * `dp[diff]` stays as‚Äëis.  

Processing rods one by one, using a copy of the table to avoid using the same rod twice,
covers all possibilities.  
Because `sum(rods) ‚â§ 5000`, the DP array size is at most 5001 ‚Äì tiny.

---

## 3. The Code  

Below are three self‚Äëcontained solutions.  
All three use the same DP idea but are tailored to each language‚Äôs idioms.

### 3.1 Java  

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int tallestBillboard(int[] rods) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int r : rods) total += r;

        int[] dp = new int[total + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, -1);
        dp[0] = 0;                      // zero difference, zero height

        for (int rod : rods) {
            int[] next = dp.clone();     // copy to avoid reuse in same iteration
            for (int diff = 0; diff <= total - rod; diff++) {
                if (dp[diff] < 0) continue; // impossible state

                // Put rod on the shorter side
                int d1 = diff + rod;
                next[d1] = Math.max(next[d1], dp[diff]);

                // Put rod on the longer side
                int d2 = Math.abs(diff - rod);
                int added = Math.min(diff, rod);
                next[d2] = Math.max(next[d2], dp[diff] + added);
            }
            dp = next;
        }
        return dp[0];   // equal heights
    }
}
```

**Why it‚Äôs good**  
* Uses `int[]` for O(1) access.  
* Clones array instead of manual copy ‚Äì clean & safe.  

**Potential pitfalls**  
* `total` can be up to 5000, still fine.  
* Be careful with negative indices ‚Äì our loop bounds avoid that.  

---

### 3.2 Python 3  

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def tallestBillboard(self, rods: List[int]) -> int:
        total = sum(rods)
        dp = [-1] * (total + 1)
        dp[0] = 0

        for rod in rods:
            next_dp = dp[:]           # shallow copy
            for diff in range(total - rod + 1):
                if dp[diff] < 0:
                    continue
                # rod on shorter side
                d1 = diff + rod
                next_dp[d1] = max(next_dp[d1], dp[diff])

                # rod on longer side
                d2 = abs(diff - rod)
                added = min(diff, rod)
                next_dp[d2] = max(next_dp[d2], dp[diff] + added)

            dp = next_dp

        return dp[0]
```

**Why it‚Äôs good**  
* `dp[:]` gives a fast copy.  
* List comprehension is avoided to keep O(N¬∑S) time.  

**Pitfalls**  
* Python‚Äôs `int` is unbounded ‚Äì no overflow worries.  
* Ensure `total - rod + 1` doesn‚Äôt go negative (handled by loop condition).

---

### 3.3 C++17  

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int tallestBillboard(vector<int>& rods) {
        int total = accumulate(rods.begin(), rods.end(), 0);
        vector<int> dp(total + 1, -1);
        dp[0] = 0;

        for (int rod : rods) {
            vector<int> next = dp;           // copy
            for (int diff = 0; diff <= total - rod; ++diff) {
                if (dp[diff] < 0) continue;

                // add to shorter side
                int d1 = diff + rod;
                next[d1] = max(next[d1], dp[diff]);

                // add to longer side
                int d2 = abs(diff - rod);
                int added = min(diff, rod);
                next[d2] = max(next[d2], dp[diff] + added);
            }
            dp.swap(next);
        }
        return dp[0];
    }
};
```

**Why it‚Äôs good**  
* `vector<int>` keeps cache friendliness.  
* `swap` avoids reallocation overhead.  

**Pitfalls**  
* Remember to `#include <numeric>` for `accumulate`.  
* The array size is small (‚â§‚ÄØ5001), so no memory issues.

### 4.1 Introduction  

If you‚Äôre preparing for a technical interview, LeetCode‚Äôs ‚ÄúTallest Billboard‚Äù (Problem 956) is a *must‚Äëknow*.  
It tests three core skills:

1. **Dynamic programming** ‚Äì thinking in terms of state transitions.  
2. **Bit‚Äëmasking vs. DP trade‚Äëoffs** ‚Äì knowing when to use exponential solutions.  
3. **Space optimisation** ‚Äì handling constraints like `sum(rods) ‚â§ 5000`.

In this article we‚Äôll dissect the problem, walk through the *difference DP* solution, discuss the pros/cons, and share how mastering this pattern can land you a job.

---

### 4.2 Problem Recap (Short Version)

Given an array `rods` (length ‚â§‚ÄØ20, each rod ‚â§‚ÄØ1000), weld disjoint subsets into two supports that must be **exactly the same height**.  
Return the maximum possible height, or `0` if impossible.

---

### 4.3 The ‚ÄúGood‚Äù: Why the Difference DP is Elegant  

| Feature | Why It‚Äôs Great |
|---------|----------------|
| **Linear in sum** | The DP table size is bounded by `S = sum(rods)` (‚â§‚ÄØ5000), making it fast for all inputs. |
| **No bit‚Äëmasking** | Avoids `O(3^N)` brute force. Works in `O(N¬∑S)` time and `O(S)` memory. |
| **Clear intuition** | Tracking the *difference* between supports collapses two‚Äëdimensional state into one. |
| **Reusable** | Same pattern appears in problems like *Maximum Sum of 3 Non‚ÄëOverlapping Subarrays*, *Divide Chocolate*, etc. |

> *Job‚Äëvalue:* Interviewers love when you spot a simple state that collapses a complex problem. It demonstrates deep algorithmic thinking.

---

### 4.4 The ‚ÄúBad‚Äù: Edge Cases and Implementation Gotchas  

| Issue | Explanation | Mitigation |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Negative states** | `dp[diff]` may remain `-1` (unreachable). Forgetting to check this leads to wrong `max` calls. | Always guard with `if (dp[diff] < 0) continue;`. |
| **Copying the DP array** | Using the same array while iterating causes a rod to be counted twice. | Clone (`dp.clone()` / `dp[:]` / `vector<int> next = dp`). |
| **Array bounds** | Looping up to `total - rod` prevents overflow. | Explicit bound check. |
| **Large memory in Python** | Using a dictionary can be memory‚Äëheavy for `S = 5000`. | Stick to a list of length `S+1`. |

> *Practical tip:* Write a quick unit test for the worst‚Äëcase (`rods = [1]*20`) to confirm you don‚Äôt exceed time/memory limits.

---

### 4.5 The ‚ÄúUgly‚Äù: Alternative Brute‚ÄëForce Approaches  

| Approach | Complexity | Why It‚Äôs Ugly |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Recursive 3‚Äëstate** (assign each rod to left, right, or skip) | `O(3^N)` | Infeasible for `N=20`. |
| **Bit‚Äëmask enumeration** of left subset, compute right subset | `O(2^N)` | Still too slow; plus we need to check equality. |
| **DP over subsets** | `O(2^N ¬∑ N)` | Memory explosion. |

> *Lesson:* Brute force can be a nice ‚Äúwarm‚Äëup‚Äù but will not impress interviewers or run on real constraints.

*(Insert the Java/Python/C++ code from above here, optionally with line numbers or collapsed sections.)*

### 4.7 Why This Pattern Matters in Interviews  

1. **State Compression** ‚Äì Reducing dimensions often leads to a breakthrough.  
2. **Dynamic Programming Mastery** ‚Äì Shows you can design transition functions.  
3. **Space‚ÄëTime Trade‚Äëoffs** ‚Äì Understanding how to keep memory low while keeping speed high.  

> *Real‚Äëworld example:* Companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook use DP patterns in system design interviews.
