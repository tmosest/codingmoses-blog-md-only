## 1. Java – 1‑Based K, O(n²) flips (≤ 2 n‑1)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> pancakeSort(int[] arr) {
        List<Integer> flips = new ArrayList<>();
        int n = arr.length;

        // We sort from the largest element down to 1
        for (int currSize = n; currSize > 1; currSize--) {

            // 1️⃣ Find the index of the largest element in arr[0 … currSize‑1]
            int maxIdx = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < currSize; i++) {
                if (arr[i] > arr[maxIdx]) maxIdx = i;
            }

            // Already in the right place? → continue
            if (maxIdx == currSize - 1) continue;

            // 2️⃣ Bring the largest element to the front (if it isn’t already there)
            if (maxIdx != 0) {
                flip(arr, maxIdx);          // k = maxIdx + 1
                flips.add(maxIdx + 1);
            }

            // 3️⃣ Move it to its final position
            flip(arr, currSize - 1);         // k = currSize
            flips.add(currSize);
        }

        return flips;
    }

    /** Reverses arr[0 … k] inclusive (k is 0‑based).  */
    private void flip(int[] arr, int k) {
        int i = 0, j = k;
        while (i < j) {
            int tmp = arr[i];
            arr[i++] = arr[j];
            arr[j--] = tmp;
        }
    }
}
```

> **Why 1‑based `k`?**  
> LeetCode expects the flip size (`k`) to be **1‑based**.  
> The helper `flip(arr, k)` uses a 0‑based index internally.

## 2. Python – Clean & Pythonic

```python
class Solution:
    def pancakeSort(self, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        flips = []
        n = len(arr)

        for curr in range(n, 1, -1):
            # index of the largest element in the first 'curr' items
            max_idx = arr.index(max(arr[:curr]))

            if max_idx == curr - 1:           # already in place
                continue

            # bring the max element to the front
            if max_idx != 0:
                arr[:max_idx+1] = reversed(arr[:max_idx+1])
                flips.append(max_idx + 1)

            # bring it to its final position
            arr[:curr] = reversed(arr[:curr])
            flips.append(curr)

        return flips
```

---

## 3. C++ – STL & O(n²) flips

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> pancakeSort(vector<int>& arr) {
        vector<int> flips;
        int n = arr.size();

        for (int curr = n; curr > 1; --curr) {
            // Find the largest element's index in arr[0 … curr-1]
            int maxIdx = max_element(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + curr) - arr.begin();

            if (maxIdx == curr - 1) continue;          // already in correct spot

            // Bring it to the front if it isn't already
            if (maxIdx != 0) {
                reverse(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + maxIdx + 1);
                flips.push_back(maxIdx + 1);           // k is 1‑based
            }

            // Flip it to its final position
            reverse(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + curr);
            flips.push_back(curr);
        }
        return flips;
    }
};
```

### Title  
**Pancake Sorting: The Sweetest Way to Nail LeetCode 969 (and Impress Interviewers)**  

### Meta‑Description  
Learn how to solve LeetCode 969 – Pancake Sorting – in Java, Python, and C++. Understand the algorithm, time complexity, pitfalls, and why this problem is a *must‑know* for your next software engineering interview.

---

## 1. Introduction

Picture a stack of pancakes. You can flip the top *k* pancakes and reverse their order.  
In computer science that’s called a **pancake flip**.  
The problem: given a permutation of 1…n, sort it using only such flips.  
Why does a recruiter care? Because it tests:

- **Array manipulation**  
- **Greedy strategy**  
- **Space/time trade‑offs**  
- **Attention to detail** (flipping the correct number of elements)

---

## 2. Problem Statement (LeetCode 969)

| Parameter | Constraints |
|-----------|-------------|
| `arr.length` | 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 |
| `arr[i]` | 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n, all unique (a permutation) |
| Output | Any list of `k` values that sorts the array, with at most `10 * n` flips |

> **Note:** `k` is *1‑based* (e.g., `k = 4` flips the first 4 elements).

---

## 3. The Greedy Idea – “Largest to the End”

1. **Iterate from the end to the front.**  
   For `currSize = n … 2`, the element that should be at position `currSize‑1` is the *largest* among the first `currSize` numbers.
2. **Bring that element to the front** (if it isn’t already).  
   Flip the sub‑array `[0 … maxIdx]`.  
   `k = maxIdx + 1`.
3. **Move it to its final spot** by flipping the sub‑array `[0 … currSize‑1]`.  
   `k = currSize`.

Why does it work?  
Because after step 2 the largest unsorted element is at index 0.  
Step 3 reverses the prefix `[0 … currSize‑1]`, moving that element to its final index (`currSize‑1`) while keeping all larger elements already placed.

**Maximum flips:**  
At most 2 flips per element → `≤ 2n − 2` flips, comfortably below the `10n` limit.

---

## 4. Algorithm Complexity

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Finding `maxIdx` | O(currSize) → O(n²) overall | O(1) |
| Reversals | O(currSize) → O(n²) | O(1) |
| Total | **O(n²)** (n ≤ 100, trivial) | **O(1)** (besides output list) |

The algorithm is *simple* but *optimal enough* for interview constraints.

---

## 5. Implementation Highlights

### Java
- Use a helper `flip(int[] arr, int k)` that reverses `arr[0 … k]`.
- Skip flips of size 1 (they do nothing).
- Keep a `List<Integer>` for the answer.

### Python
- Leverage Python’s slicing: `arr[:k] = reversed(arr[:k])`.
- `list.index()` + `max()` inside the slice gives `maxIdx`.
- Append `maxIdx+1` and `currSize` to the result.

### C++
- Use `reverse(begin, end)` from `<algorithm>`.
- `max_element` finds the index of the maximum in the prefix.

---

## 6. Good, Bad, Ugly

### The Good
- **Conceptually simple**: “largest → front → back”.
- **Deterministic**: No back‑tracking or recursion.
- **LeetCode‑ready**: Follows exact output format and limits.

### The Bad
- **O(n²)**: For `n=100` still trivial, but not optimal for larger data.
- **Repeated scans**: Finding the max each iteration can be costly in other contexts.
- **Flipping overhead**: In languages with expensive slice copies (e.g., some Python variants) you might hit memory limits on larger arrays.

### The Ugly
- **Off‑by‑one traps**: Remember that `k` is 1‑based while indices are 0‑based in code.
- **Misinterpreting the array as a stack**: If you reverse the *whole* array instead of the prefix, the algorithm breaks.
- **Assuming the input is sorted**: Many candidates start by checking `if arr[currSize-1] == currSize`, but forget that `currSize` is the *prefix length*, not the element value.

---

## 7. Real‑World Analogies

- **Job queue re‑ordering** in a database where only “bulk reverse” operations are cheap.
- **Undo/redo stacks**: Flipping segments is akin to reversing a segment of actions.
- **CPU cache line re‑ordering**: Some low‑level optimizations use “reverse segment” to minimize memory traffic.

---

## 7. FAQ

| Q | A |
|---|---|
| *Can we reduce the time complexity to O(n log n)?* | Yes, by maintaining a position map so that you can find `maxIdx` in O(1). But it’s unnecessary for n ≤ 100. |
| *What if `arr` already contains 1 at the first position?* | The algorithm still works: we skip the first flip (`maxIdx == 0`). |
| *Does the order of flips matter?* | Only the sequence matters. The algorithm produces a *canonical* sequence, but any correct one will pass. |
| *Can we use a stack data structure?* | You can, but it’s overkill – the array itself is the “pancake stack.” |

---

## 8. How to Use This Knowledge in Interviews

| Skill Tested | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Greedy reasoning** | Shows you can turn a global optimum into local steps. |
| **Array reverse** | Many interview problems involve `reverse`, `rotate`, or `rotateRight`. |
| **1‑based vs. 0‑based** | Off‑by‑one errors are the top 3 interview bugs. |
| **Edge‑case handling** | Recruiters love candidates who consider empty or already sorted inputs. |

**Pro tip:** When you’re asked a problem that *looks* “hard” but has a neat greedy solution, ask the interviewer if there’s a known optimal algorithm. Sometimes a simple solution is all that’s required.

## 9. Quick Test Checklist

| ✅ | Item |
|---|------|
| [x] Handles `k = 1` gracefully. |
| [x] Produces ≤ 10 n flips. |
| [x] Works for n = 1 (returns an empty list). |
| [x] Skips unnecessary flips. |
| [x] Uses only O(1) extra space (besides the answer). |

## 10. Conclusion

Pancake Sorting is the *perfect* interview showcase for array manipulation and greedy strategy.  
It’s short enough to code under a 30‑minute time limit, yet deep enough that a recruiter can see you understand:

- **Greedy design**  
- **Complexity trade‑offs**  
- **Language‑specific pitfalls**

Master the three implementations above, remember the off‑by‑one quirk, and you’ll be ready to **conquer LeetCode 969** – and any other array‑reversal problem that follows.  

Good luck, and may your code always be perfectly flipped into order! 🚀
